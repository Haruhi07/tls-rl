The ripple effects of last week 's offshore drilling rig explosion widened Monday as crude oil continued to spill into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of about a thousand barrels a day and oil company officials said it would take at least two to four weeks to get it under control . The growing spill also threatened to churn political waters as lawmakers weigh what buffer zones to establish between rigs and shorelines in the wake of President Obama 's decision to open up new regions to offshore drilling . It could also alter details of a climate bill that three leading senators were trying to restart after postponing plans for a rollout that would have featured leading oil company executives . The Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean and leased to BP , caught fire April 20 after an explosion and sank . Eleven oil rig workers are missing and presumed dead . The rig , with a platform bigger than a football field and insured for $ 560 million , was one of the most modern and was drilling in 5,000 feet of water . Remotely operated vehicles located two places where oil was leaking from the well pipe , the U.S. Coast Guard said . The Coast Guard said there was an area 42 miles by 80 miles with a rainbow sheen of emulsified crude located less than 40 miles offshore . An oil rig 10 miles away from the Deepwater Horizon was evacuated as a precaution . Environmentalists noted that although the sunken rig 's distance from shore gives oil companies more time to keep the spill from reaching U.S. coastlines , it also means that the water is deeper , making it harder to get the spill under control . `` It 's good because it gives you the chance to intercept it before it reaches the coast , but it is harder to cap a well the deeper the water you 're drilling in , '' said Aitan Manuel , an expert on offshore drilling at the Sierra Club . `` It 's presenting a lot of challenges to the companies . '' Some lawmakers called for an inquiry into safety regulation . `` This may be the worst disaster in recent years , but it 's certainly not an isolated incident , '' Sens. Bill Nelson -LRB- D-Fla . -RRB- , Frank R. Lautenberg -LRB- D-N.J. -RRB- and Robert Menendez -LRB- D-N.J. -RRB- , all foes of expanded offshore drilling , wrote to the heads of the Energy and Commerce committees . They said that before the Deepwater Horizon accident , the Minerals Management Service had reported 509 fires , resulting in at least two fatalities and 12 serious injuries , on rigs in the Gulf since 2006 . Some former federal oil safety regulators suggested that MMS , which runs lease sales , should transfer rig safety oversight to a separate agency . Meanwhile , BP and U.S. Coast Guard vessels rushed to contain the spill . A similar spill off the western Australia coast last year took 10 weeks to bring under control . BP said it would attempt to drill two relief wells to intercept the oil flow and divert it to new pipes and storage vessels . It said it was also working to fabricate a dome to cover the leak area and channel it into a new pipe to storage facilities . Such a technique has been used in shallower water but not at these depths , Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said in a conference call . The company continued to try to activate the blowout preventer , a 450-ton piece of equipment on the sea floor that is supposed to seal the well to prevent the type of accident that took place . Charlie Henry , the lead science coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said that three sperm whales were seen swimming near the spill but that they appeared unaffected . But other environmentalists warned of damage . `` Oil spills are extremely harmful to marine life when they occur and often for years or even decades later , '' said Jacqueline Savitz , a marine scientist and climate campaign director at Oceana , an environmental group . She said spills could coat sea birds and limit their flying ability and damage fisheries by injuring marine organism 's systems related to respiration , vision and reproduction . Savitz said that the Gulf of Mexico is host to four species of endangered sea turtles and bluefin tuna , snapper and grouper . `` Each of these can be affected , '' she said . `` Turtles have to come to the surface to breathe and can be coated with oil or may swallow it . '' And , she added , the Gulf is one of only two nurseries for bluefin tuna , more than 90 percent of which return to their place of birth to spawn .

Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- said . `` We are expecting to see the first impact at Pass-A-Loutre today , Chandeleur Islands on Saturday , '' Jindal said at a briefing in Baton Rouge . The Coast Guard confirmed that the leading edge of the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico is three miles from Pass-A-Loutre Wildlife Management Area , the Reuters news agency reported . The area is at the mouth of the Mississippi River . The spill could threaten wildlife , tourism and the livelihoods of fishermen . `` We are being very aggressive and we are prepared for the worst case , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Sally Brice-O'Hare , the service 's deputy commandant for operations , said at the White House . The oil spill is not only moving faster toward shore than was anticipated , it is also pouring out vastly more crude oil than initially estimated . The White House said Thursday that President Obama had directed his administration -- including the Pentagon -- to aggressively join in cleanup efforts . The government declared the spill to be of `` national significance , '' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said , which clears the way for a wider federal response to prevent environmental damage . But officials warned that it may take 90 days to shut off the flow of leaking oil . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that oil could be pouring out of the ground at a rate of up to 5,000 barrels a day . Federal officials expressed frustration Thursday with the inability of BP , the oil company that had drilled the undersea well , to seal the ruptured wellhead . `` The spill is now crossing different regions , '' Napolitano said . `` We will continue to push BP to engage in the strongest response possible . '' The Pentagon is reviewing what resources it could offer in the cleanup , but no decision has been reached , spokesman Geoff Morrell said . `` We have come to no conclusions yet to what those -LRB- resources -RRB- might be and whether they would be of much assistance to the effort down there , '' Morrell said . In a briefing at the White House , Napolitano and other administration officials rejected the suggestions that the administration had been slow to deal with the spill , saying that it has employed booms , skimmers and chemical dispersants to try to control the oil . Weather and sea conditions Thursday prevented officials from trying another controlled burn of the oil . Such a burn worked Wednesday with a small test section of the slick .

The Coast Guard and BP set fire to a portion of the crude oil floating in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday in a bid to limit the impact of a widening slick , which federal officials said could touch shore in parts of the Louisiana delta as early as Friday evening . With BP unable to stop the flow of oil from a deepwater exploration well that blew up last week , attention was turning to the gulf 's coastlines , where the spill could threaten wildlife , tourism and the livelihoods of fishermen . `` It 's premature to say this is catastrophic , '' said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry . `` I will say that this is very serious . '' The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated Wednesday night that oil could be pouring out of the ground at a rate of up to 5,000 barrels a day . That is five times BP 's earlier estimate . Government officials said Wednesday they had urged BP to seek additional help from the Defense Department in protecting the shoreline . President Obama was briefed Wednesday by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on the situation . Earlier , the Coast Guard said the company corralled the thickest areas of the oil slick inside fireproof booms , lighted it late in the afternoon and burned it for 28 minutes . By burning off several thousand gallons of oil , the Coast Guard said , it could limit damage to coastal areas . The unusual strategy has been used for damaged tankers in World War II , in an oil spill off Britain and in rare cases on inland waters in Louisiana and Texas . But a burn off U.S. shores and the prospect of oil landing on the gulf coastline could become powerful symbols of the perils of offshore drilling , just as President Obama and Congress appear set to open new areas to offshore oil and gas exploration . On Wednesday , the Obama administration said it will open federal waters to wind farms , approving a divisive offshore project near Cape Cod in Massachusetts -- and providing a juxtaposition of controversies over both old and new energy sources . The crisis in the gulf is likely to get worse before it gets better . It began April 20 , when an oil and gas discovery blew upward , setting the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on fire . The rig , owned by Transocean and leased to BP , later sank , and 11 of its workers are missing and presumed dead . At its current rate , the spill could surpass by next week the size of the 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped lead to the far-reaching moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts , a ban that Obama recently said he wants to modify . It would take about 260 days for this incident to exceed the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska , but it took several weeks for a similar oil well blowout to be brought under control off the coast of Australia last year . Asked about the potential political effects of the spill , BP chief executive Tony Hayward said : `` It 's far too early to tell . I think a lot of it will be determined by the intensity of the response , the quality of the response and the success of the response . '' He said BP is trying to be `` very forward-leaning . We have enormous resources committed to contain it . '' In recent years , BP has been plagued with other troubles , such as an explosion at a Texas refinery , construction delays on a gulf production platform and leaks in one of its Alaska pipelines .

Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- expressed alarm that prevention efforts so far have been ineffective , and he demanded that the federal government and oil giant BP uphold their commitments to help avert an environmental disaster . In an afternoon news conference with Obama administration officials , Jindal said he was worried that miles of booms deployed offshore are `` not effective '' in preventing oil from damaging coastal areas , wildlife and the livelihoods of fishermen . He announced that he is seeking to mobilize 6,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen for 90 days of duty to help provide security and support the response to the oil spill . `` I do have concerns that BP 's current resources are not adequate '' to meet three main challenges from the disaster : stopping the leak of oil from a damaged undersea well , protecting the coast and carrying out a swift cleanup . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who visited the area with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and other federal officials , stressed that BP , which owns the leaking oil , is `` the responsible party '' under U.S. law and is `` required to fund the cost of cleanup operations . '' She urged the company to `` leverage additional assets '' for the effort . `` We have anticipated and planned for a worst-case scenario from day one , '' Napolitano said . She said the administration is using all available resources to respond to the disaster . Earlier , the White House pledged not to expand offshore oil drilling until federal investigations are completed into what caused the Deepwater Horizon rig to explode April 20 and sink into the gulf two days later . With the edge of the massive spill reaching the U.S. coastline late Thursday , and bad weather triggering a coastal flood warning , the crisis is threatening to eclipse the Exxon Valdez as the nation 's worst environmental disaster in decades . Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested that cleanup efforts could end up costing billions of dollars . Coast Guard crews patrolled coastal marshes in southeastern Louisiana on Friday in search of areas where the oil has flowed in , the Associated Press reported , and the state of Louisiana diverted thousands of gallons of fresh water from the Mississippi River to try to flush out the wetlands . Weather was complicating the effort to control the oil spill . The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the Louisiana coast from Friday until Sunday evening and said waves of six to seven feet were pushing tides several feet above normal . The service also cautioned small craft to expect `` strong winds and hazardous seas '' through the weekend off the shores of Mississippi and Louisiana . It forecast winds of 17 to 29 mph with occasional gusts to 38 mph . `` Seas are expected to build to 13 feet by Saturday night in the outer coastal waters and near 9 feet in the near shore waters , '' an advisory said , with `` steep breaking waves in shoal areas . '' The rough seas slowed efforts by a flotilla of ships to skim the oily mixture from the water 's surface , federal officials said . The Pentagon is sending two C-130 Hercules cargo planes to Mississippi to aid in the cleanup , by dumping chemical dispersants on the water . A number of civilian planes have already been doing the same job .

President Obama said Friday morning that his administration is doing `` everything necessary '' to respond . Officials have classified the situation as an `` incident of national significance , '' officially defined as an event that requires a coordinated response to minimize damage , save lives and plan for long-term economic recovery . The government 's National Response Team -- composed of 16 federal agencies and departments -- coordinates the federal response . In that vein , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson , Energy and Climate Change Policy Assistant Carol Browner and NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco plan to visit the Gulf Coast region Friday to oversee federal efforts . Napolitano and Salazar will appear jointly on several of the Sunday morning news shows , the White House said . The government and BP Oil have deployed 1,178 people to the region to protect the Gulf Coast shoreline and wildlife , according to the White House . Officials have established five staging areas -- in Biloxi , Miss. , Pensacola , Fla. , Venice , La. , Pascagoula , Miss. , and Theodore , Ala. -- to protect sensitive shorelines . Here 's more agency-specific information -- which will update as necessary : The Coast Guard and BP deployed 76 response vessels , including skimmers , tugs , barges and recovery vessels to assist in containment and cleanup efforts . They 've also sent six fixed-wing aircraft , 11 helicopters , 10 remotely operated vehicles and two mobile offshore drilling units . The public-private response is using 174,060 feet of boom to contain the spill with a total 265,460 feet ordered as of Friday morning . Two C-130 Hercules cargo planes specially designed for aerial spraying have been sent to Mississippi and are awaiting orders to start dumping chemicals on the oil spill , a spokesman told the Associated Press . The Navy also has sent equipment for the cleanup . The agency is monitoring air quality in the region to measure the potential impact of the controlled burn of some of the oil . Jackson said the agency will consult and consider low tech or no tech solutions for preserving the Gulf Coasts fragile ecosystem . Napolitano was the official who declared the spill an '' incident of national significance . '' The department deployed SWAT teams from the Minerals Management Service to inspect 30 drilling rigs operating in the deepwater sections of the Gulf of Mexico . Inspections should be completed within the next week , according to an Interior Department spokeswoman . Inspectors will check to see whether the rigs have conducted blow-out preventer tests and inspect related records , the spokeswoman said . The teams will also verify that emergency well control exercises are taking place . Inspectors will then inspect 47 deep-water production platforms in the gulf , a process that will take longer than rig inspections because of the complexities of the structures . Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Friday he is dispatching attorneys from multiple divisions of the Justice Department to New Orleans to meet with the U.S. attorney and response teams and to monitor the oil spill . The team will be led by Ignacia S. Moreno , head of the environment and natural resources division and Tony West , head of the criminal division . The agency is providing on-site support and predicting the oil spill 's trajectory . The Office of Response and Restoration is the agency 's biggest star , conducting overflight surveys to track the oil slick . The National Weather Service is providing weather forecasts to the entire response team and NOAA is consulting the government and BP folks on the potential impact to fish , birds , marine mammals and sea turtles . It 's also using experimental satellite data to survey the marine pollution and will work on determining the full nature and extent of the damage to natural resources and the restoration work needed . Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton tells NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that any future offshore drilling `` ca n't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills . '' Leave your thoughts in the comments section below Are the teabaggers going to do anything to get their beloved corporate leaders to clean up the mess they made ? Or are they going to be big time hypocrites and demand Obama do something about it ? The spill happened April 20 . 11 days later , and it is still worsening ? I thought we were getting a President that could actually respond to disasters , not lolly gag while things get worse . It is a great summary of the Rep. side of the debate about staying with oil dependency and doing more drilling . I am also glad it is about to land on the soil of Rep. states . I also know that they `` industries '' effected by this will want government intervention and government money . Which the Rep. will want for `` their '' people . Just like farm subsidies . Rep. cry about government spending when they do n't come up with the idea . Hope the oil destroys the coast line maybe then people will see the need for Green Energy . I live in Pensacola , FL and have lived all my life . The only reason I stay here is because its the only part of the gulf that has n't been raped . when will you people learn it 's your own fault for not protesting oil drilling in the first place . All you wanted in the early 2000 's was to get cheaper gas prices and now my home and life is the test tube that you people have used to make your pockets deeper . Much better than Bush 's Katrina . There is no cover up in this . We know what we face in this oil spill . Do n't deny a another natural malfunction of equipment . Do n't EVEN make this sound like Obama 's fault . Or any cover up . If it was a cover up , he would n't be in the Rose Garden talking about it . -LRB- shades of Bush taking so long with Katrina -RRB- This administration is all over this oil spill . Or would you rather have off shore drilling with faulty mechanics . Do n't you all have more brains ? And between this disaster and the disaster in Arizona , you best try to put on a happy face , because it is going to get worse . Our entire Gulf Coast will be affected . 35 years of evolution to correct it all . So anyone `` blaming '' - blame the mechanics of BP And realize what this will do . From Elway 's 2 restaurants in Denver , to the Seafood Shop in the Hamptons . Bye bye shrimp and oysters . Not REP or DEM . you people ca n't see that our way of life here is worth more to us than just a political debate about who was right . This is our home . I 'm not going to dump oil on the white house b\\/c of someones ideas . Its every persons problem . The people in the U.S. are to weak to stand together and fight for a common goal . Stop watching T.V. and complaining about what people you elected are doing . Ohhh ya it was Bush 's brother who told the oil companies they could n't drill off Florida 's coast so Bush haters can suck it . This is a problem that stems far deeper than your political beliefs Posted by : rallyart2012 | April 30 , 2010 12:27 PM | Report abuse Does anybody not believe that Obama and\\/or his collaborators did n't wish this would happen ? He will stoop to incredible depths to get his way and keep pushing for the elimination of State governments . The timing was just too convenient .

Stop blaming the people you put in office . Do Something besides complain about your political peers . Not complaining about what others are not doing . Grow up America and start putting our kids futures in our own hands , not others . Yep ... one person per 8 metric tons of oil spilled and counting . But it 's okay , TheBabeNemo says everything that could be done is being done . Listen up Babe , Obama wanted off-shore drilling just a few days ago ... I wo n't forget that as easily as you already have . This failure , whether mechanical\\/human error , sabotage or other demonstrates the risks and compromises we make as a society in order to enjoy our high standard of living . Since few are willing to give up the amenities of modern life , the question is not whether we will `` drill , baby , drill '' but what we can do in the future to prevent another oil rig disaster , coal mine explosion or nuclear power plant meltdown . Oil kills when we spill it into the ocean . BAN OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING PERMANENTLY !!! We need to get off of fossil fuels immediately and implement alternative energy solutions that do n't involve toxic substances such as petroleum . Only the greediest , coldest , and most calloused human beings could still be pro-fossil fuels given all of the damage to our planet that they cause . Anyone who believes that offshore drilling should continue needs to go take a swim in the Gulf of Mexico ...

I hope that list of resources deployed simply reflects that fact that the Federal Government ca n't respond until after local resources are exhausted , and not a sign that everyone is missing that there will be a real and lasting human impact from the spill . Residents of the Gulf Coast are survivors one and all , but studies also show that individuals have fewer coping resources -LRB- therefore greater impact from disasters -RRB- when they 've already been traumitized . Slow motion disasters can be the hardest to keep from happening , but now is the time to start trying . It would be the first time any of them had done anything useful . That just cracks me up .

The situation is only BPs and that is who will be paying . Wow , about time the oil company has to foot the bill . Even though they say 2000 barrells were estimated spilling out why did n't anyone hit the e-stop . With all this technology today you would think we would have a better way to have capped the leak . I do have a feeling there was more to this than what people are being lead to believe . What happened happened now lets use the resources we have and give the Billion dollar bill to BP . They have the money , ca n't take it with them when they pass on . & instead of arguing whos fault it is , you should be DOING something about it . I 'm straight out of college -LRB- 20yrs old -RRB- and I have better sense on what is going on then some of you losers on here . Of course we 'll never know what happened since the rig is on the ocean floor . First the coal mine explosion and now the oir rig explosion - it all seems a bit too weird to me . Who would have thought that allowing the free market to handle its own problems would n't work out ... Hey Rightists , so now `` big government '' is the solution to the problem ? Why exactly is the US Government even responsible to do anything to correct a corporation 's mistake ? Some are quick to want a king to manage it all , others are quick to blame the devastated ship 's crew and its owners , others are willing to accept a random , `` big bang theory '' inspite of checks and balances in equipment and procedures . I 'm just curious why we all want to expend energy blaming and lynching before the story is done ...

Friday , April 30 , 2010 ; 2:30 PM A huge spreading oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico washed up to coastal Louisiana wildlife and seafood areas on Friday and the U.S. government and military struggled to avert what could become one of the nation 's worst ecological disasters . Harrisburg , Pa. : How does this oil spill directly affect aquatic life ? What immediate and direct damage does this do to what species of fish and other aquatic life , which move but are displaced , and what are some of the ecosystem changes that can result from this ? Jacqueline Savitz : There are a lot of marine life at risk . Sea turtles , fish , marine mammals , birds , you name it . Oil is extremely toxic to marine life of all kinds . Many fish spawn in the Gulf including Atlantic blue fin tuna which are under severe pressure from overfishing . Their larvae are very sensitive and the spill could affect their populations . Also snapper and grouper , all of those are important commercially . There are also 4 species of sea turtles in the Gulf and they are all endangered or threatened . They can be exposed to oil when they come up to breath , and end up being coated by oil and even swallowing some of it . This can interfere with their digestion , respiration , and a variety of other functions . Sea birds are the classic poster child for oil spills . Coating can leave them unable to keep warm and cause hypothermia . Calgary , Alberta : This paper reported that `` That inquiry will likely focus on the blowout-preventer , which like the sunken drilling rig , was owned by Transocean . In Norway , for example , blowout preventers are required to have a device known as an acoustic valve that can help assure activation in the event of an accident , but that device is n't required in the United States and was n't part of the blowout preventer used on this well . BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said Wednesday that the blowout preventer had been inspected 10 days before the accident . '' Lock Haven , Pa. : Do you think this spill will have long-term effects on President Obama 's efforts to build up our offshore drilling ? Jacqueline Savitz : I think the spill is making a lot of people rethink their views on offshore drilling . We have been told by the industry that drilling is safe , and it 's clearly not . We were told it would lower gas prices , and make us energy independent , which the Energy Information Agency says it will not do -LRB- government agency -RRB- . So it becomes hard to see the benefits of expanding offshore drilling . Tampa , Fla. : What is the best site on the Internet to view current satellite photographs of the oil slick ? If the spill continues unabated at its present rate for several months , what will be the approximate rate of change of the area of the slick ? What would be the maximum size after three months ? Washington , D.C. : I agree with you that there should n't be any additional offshore drilling , but what are the chances of that actually happening ? Even in the face of a disaster like this , I do n't think the oil companies will just give up . What can we do to help stop this drilling ? Brooklyn , N.Y. : The U.S. does n't require offshore rigs to have a remote shut-off that a few other countries do , apparently due to lobbying by BP and the other major oil companies . Any idea how much it would have cost to add this functionality to a rig compared to how much BP spent on lobbying against that regulation -LRB- and compared to the billions that this disaster is going to cost -RRB- ? It is unfathomable to me that this is just going to spurt oil for weeks until the pocket of oil is dry , and that they are n't required to build in a remote failsafe . Jacqueline Savitz : I know . I ca n't fathom it either , no pun taken . I do n't know for a fact , but the costs that are being discussed are as follows : `` An acoustic trigger costs about $ 500,000 , industry officials said . The Deepwater Horizon had a replacement cost of about $ 560 million , and BP says it is spending $ 6 million a day to battle the oil spill . '' Amherst , Mass. : President Obama on April 2nd when opening up new parcels for oil drilling said `` It turns out , by the way , that oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills . '' This is clearly false as this most recent incident demonstrates . He has again today committed to open up new parcels for oil drilling . What does this say about the quality of the advice that the President gets ? Or does the president just ignore the advice ? Greenbelt , Md. : Can you tell me what groups I can contact to volunteer to help with the cleanup ? I do n't have formal training but would be willing to fly out there for a few days to help however if they need people . Newport Beach , Calif. : How do the currents move and how will those currents affect states like MS , AL , TX and FLA ? Will there be permanent harm ? Charlotte , N.C. : How will the cost for the cleanup be assessed ? Is there really a price for ecological damage ? What about the potential loss of future-earnings for fisheries ? Jacqueline Savitz : This is a very good question . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- does have a method for estimating the value of natural resources . It 's not perfect , but it 's a good program that tries to get our natural resources covered , and even replaced after a disaster . Obviously we never really get the full value back , but they try . Columbia , Md. : What can an individual do to help ? Is there a volunteer program to go and clean the birds ? Or should we just give money ? Eastport , Md. : One of the big factors in BP 's inability to cap the leak is the fact that they drilled in over 5000 feet of water . Have there been restrictions on the depth of drilling , and is this likely to be a restriction in the future in the approval process for new drilling permits ? Jacqueline Savitz : Good point . The technology has improved for the drilling but this event shows the safety and cleanup technology has not kept pace . A depth restriction would make sense but we would go further . We need to shift our energy economy to clean energy and away from fossil fuels . We are going to keep drilling where we are already drilling , but if we are serious about that shift , we should not expand drilling to places that were previously protected . We think the President should put a moratorium in place on all new drilling , even for exploration . Tampa , Fla. : Will BP reimburse the Navy -LRB- funded by the taxpayer -RRB- for its assistance ? Or is this the typical scenario of privatized profits and socialized costs ? Harrisburg , Pa. : It would seem to me that prior to any oil rig being put in any waters , that there would be enough scientific knowledge and understanding as to how to cap any oil well , no matter where it is . Do n't the government . people realize that many calamities can take place ? Hurricanes , tornadoes , quakes to name a few -- and which are happening more and more . What about the rest of the oil rigs in the Gulf . And it should not take long at all to contain this stuff . Where have the scientists been all these years after the the Valdez problem . This is a total catastrophe with no decent responses -LRB- as usual for the government -RRB- . Jacqueline Savitz : Secretary of Homeland Security also is pledging to make every effort on behalf of the Obama administration and use all the resources at their disposal , and they are even planning for a worst case scenario . Jacqueline Savitz : Thanks for all the great questions ! I am going to have to sign off now . Please keep the pressure on to avoid letting this happen again , and you can follow our work at Oceana and my tweets at @jackiesavitz .

Hours before the spill started washing ashore in Louisiana late Thursday , members of Congress issued new calls for Obama to abandon his plans for expanded offshore drilling , and White House officials conceded that the spreading oil slick could cause the president to rethink his position . `` We need to figure out what happened , '' White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said . `` Would a finding of something possibly affect that ? The outlook in the Gulf of Mexico remained bleak in the wake of the April 20 explosion that sank the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and killed 11 workers . A change in the weather and choppy waters prevented a second burn of oil at sea and slowed efforts by a flotilla of ships to skim the oily mixture from the surface of the gulf , federal officials said . Continuing efforts to use remote-controlled robotic submarines to activate a malfunctioning blowout preventer lying on the sea floor in 5,000 feet of water failed . The Coast Guard approved an experimental plan by petroleum giant BP , which had leased the rig , to apply chemical dispersants underwater near the places where oil is gushing from three breaks in the well pipes at an estimated rate of 5,000 barrels a day . In Washington , the White House held a series of high-profile media events aimed at communicating that the administration is fully engaged in the crisis . Obama went to the Rose Garden and said , `` While BP is ultimately responsible for funding the cost of response and cleanup operations , my administration will continue to use every single available resource at our disposal , including potentially the Department of Defense , to address the incident . '' At a midday news conference , the administration rolled out two Cabinet chiefs and other senior White House advisers to assert that the government would do whatever it could to help BP stop the leak . The administration is well aware that the president 's campaign victory was built in part on a belief among voters that he would do a better job at responding to disasters like Hurricane Katrina than did President Bush . `` This is in that list : Are you competently running government ? '' He said the news conference with senior officials was aimed at letting the press and the public `` know what we 've done to respond . '' Janet Napolitano , secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , said there were more than 50 vessels as well as aircraft deployed to the area of the spill and that workers had laid down 174,060 feet of absorbent foam booms and recovered 18,180 barrels of an oily mixture from the gulf 's surface . She said they would also open a second command center in Mobile , Ala. , in addition to the one in Louisiana . The Navy said it is sending 66,000 feet of inflatable boom and seven skimming systems , and would offer its bases in the region as staging areas for the operation . White House officials said they began holding regular conference calls with BP executives soon after the accident . On Thursday , Obama also called the governors of the five Gulf Coast states , and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar met with oil and gas industry executives to appeal for ideas and help . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency and mobilized National Guard troops . On Friday , Napolitano , Salazar and EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson will travel to the Gulf Coast at the president 's request with Carol Browner , the White House director of energy and climate change policy , and Jane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , to inspect ooperations dedicated to minimizing environmental risks . Despite these efforts , it remained possible that the oil leak could continue for as long as three months , by which time it would rival the size of the 1989 spill from the Exxon Valdez . If efforts to reactivate the blowout-preventer fail , BP will try to lower 100-ton domes on top of the leaks in the pipes now lying on the sea floor and funnel the oil up through pipes to storage vessels . Such methods have been used before , but generally at depths of 350 feet or less . BP also plans to start drilling a relief well Friday that would intercept the oil from the existing well and plug the leak , but the company said that could take several weeks . It took more than two months to plug a similar well blowout off the coast of Australia late last year . By that time , the damage from the spill could be extensive and the political effect on Obama 's offshore drilling plan and broader climate change agenda uncertain . `` I do n't know whether it changes our understanding of offshore oil , '' David Pumphrey , deputy director of the energy and national security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said of the accident . `` But I think it changes the political debate quite a bit . '' In backing wider offshore oil and gas exploration only a month ago , Obama promised to `` employ new technologies that reduce the impact of oil exploration . '' He acknowledged that his decision would provoke criticism from those who decried the expansion and those who said it did not go far enough . `` Ultimately , we need to move beyond the tired debates of the left and the right , between business leaders and environmentalists , between those who would claim drilling is a cure-all and those who would claim it has no place , '' Obama said . The accident in the gulf may provide more firepower for the critics on the left who for years have lobbied presidents and Congress to keep in place federal moratoriums on further offshore exploration . Those moratoriums have expired . Florida Sen. Bill Nelson -LRB- D -RRB- called on Obama to step back from his expanded offshore drilling plans . In a letter to the president , Nelson said he would file legislation to ban the Interior Department from following through on Obama 's proposal for new seismic and drilling activity . He said the gulf spill `` may be an environmental and economic disaster that wreaks havoc for commercial fishing and tourism along the Gulf of Mexico coast . '' Dan McLaughlin , a top aide to Nelson , said it was too early to say whether the federal government had responded adequately to what he called `` our worst nightmare come true . '' But McLaughlin asked why the government had not done more to ensure that the oil companies could shut down a well if a catastrophic failure happened . `` Somebody is going to have to ask the question as to why the regulators did n't put this question to the industry before ? '' `` If everything fails , then what ? '' That inquiry will likely focus on the blowout-preventer , which like the sunken drilling rig was owned by Transocean . In Norway , for example , blowout preventers are required to have a device known as an acoustic valve that can help assure activation in the event of an accident , but that device is n't required in the United States and was n't part of the blowout preventer used on this well . BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said Wednesday that the blowout preventer had been inspected 10 days before the accident . The Minerals Management Service , a part of the Interior Department that oversees safety on offshore rigs , said it would complete new inspections of all gulf exploration drilling rigs within seven days to prevent a repeat of the April 20 blast . Obama aides stressed at the midday briefing that BP would bear the cost of the spill , including the cost of plugging the well , cleaning shorelines and paying for government air and water tests . Separately , fishermen and others anticipating environmental damage filed class-action suits against the company . On a day when the stock market rose broadly and sharply , BP 's stock price fell more than 8 percent to $ 52.56 a share .

As crude oil began to come ashore in Louisiana , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar met with the company 's top executives and engineers . He said later that he urged them to `` work harder and faster and smarter to get the job done . '' `` We can not rest and we will not rest until BP permanently seals the wellhead and until they clean up every drop of oil , '' Salazar said . Heavy winds and high tides impeded efforts to contain the growing slick on Friday , and oil continued to gush from the damaged exploration well in the Gulf , sending pungent odors through neighborhoods near New Orleans . Governors from the region expressed frustration at the company 's inability to get the situation under control . The crisis began April 20 , when Deepwater Horizon , a drilling rig owned by Transocean and leased by BP , caught fire and sank , killing 11 people . Ten days later , coastal residents , state officials and environmental groups are questioning whether the oil industry and Interior Department regulators had done enough to prepare for such a catastrophic accident . BP 's own exploration plan , submitted to federal regulators in February 2009 , minimized the danger of a spill . The company said `` it is unlikely that an accidental oil spill release would occur from the proposed activities . '' While it acknowledged that a spill could `` cause impacts to wetlands '' and to beaches , it added that `` due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected . '' It said any effects on fish or shellfish would be `` sub-lethal . '' Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen said in an interview Friday that the company 's plans for responding to oil spills did not address the complete failure of equipment on the seafloor designed to prevent a blowout of the sort that took place on the massive drilling rig . `` We 're breaking new ground here . It 's hard to write a plan for a catastrophic event that has no precedent , which is what this was , '' Allen said , defending the company against not writing a response for `` what could never be in a plan , what you could n't anticipate . '' Hammond Eve , who did environmental impact studies of offshore drilling for the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , said the federal agency never planned for response to an oil spill of this size . `` We never imagined that it would happen because the safety measures were supposed to work and prevent it from happening , '' he said . He added that the MMS began from the `` premise that if something like this happened , that it would be shut down fairly soon and a discrete amount of oil would be released and these cleanup measures would begin and you would never end up with a situation like this . '' Eve , who lives on the water 20 miles east of New Orleans , said strong oil fumes were engulfing his neighborhood . `` You ca n't breathe the air comfortably , '' he said . `` It bites you right in the back of the throat and your eyeballs burn . '' Obama administration officials fanned out across the Gulf states pledging attention and assistance . In an already troubled economy , the oil slick threatened to damage the region 's fishing and tourism industries as well as disrupt shipping along the Mississippi River . On Friday , Louisiana 's departments of Health and Hospitals and Wildlife and Fisheries announced severe restrictions on fishing and oyster harvesting east of the Mississippi River .

The cord-grass marshes of south Louisiana are nurseries for baby shrimp , stalking grounds for blue crabs , and barriers that slow down waves before they bite off more of the mainland . On Friday , they were becoming defenseless sponges for sticky , dark oil . The locals said the foul-smelling mass had the goopy look of chocolate mousse . The scientists said the enormous slick had the potential to bring environmental ruin to this treasured coastline . The oil is spilling out of the seafloor at 5,000 barrels a day -- the equivalent of 210,000 gallons -- maybe much more , from a well about 50 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico , and it could soon eclipse the volume of the infamous Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 . That disaster spilled oil onto rocky Alaskan beaches , but it is at least possible to wash oil off a rock . In the Gulf , the oil is floating into wetlands that could hold on to its toxins for years . And , scientists said , the spill 's damage could be magnified by its awful timing . Among the animals that live along the Gulf Coast , this is the time for hatching and rearing : Species as diverse as pelicans , shrimp and alligators are all reproducing , or preparing to . That could bring sensitive young animals in contact with toxic oil or cause their parents to plunge into oily waters looking for food . Already , rescuers from Delaware were using Dawn blue dish soap to clean the first bird found to be `` oiled '' in the disaster , the Associated Press reported . The bird , a young northern gannet , had been turned from white to black . `` I ca n't imagine we 're not going to have some mass casualties '' among these birds , said Michael Parr of the American Bird Conservancy . `` It 's got to be about the worst time right now '' for an oil spill to hit . One environmentalist said the scenario created `` a potential mega-disaster . '' Along the Gulf , they were waiting for it with a dread usually devoted to hurricanes . `` The magnitude and the potential for ecological damage is probably more great than anything we 've ever seen in the Gulf of Mexico , '' said Nancy Rabalais , a scientist who heads the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium , a research center in Cocodrie , La. `` Once it hits the shoreline , it 'll get into everything . '' The oil has been flowing since April 22 , when a drilling rig called the Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank 50 miles out in the Gulf . By late Friday , federal officials estimated that the slick had reached land in Louisiana 's isolated southeast corner and was being pushed ashore by strong winds . It had already surrounded some of the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana , where thousands of brown pelicans are roosting . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which oversees the islands , has protected them with a ring of floating booms .

View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk . PASS CHRISTIAN , MISS. -- In this Gulf Coast fishing town , they spent Saturday awaiting , and dreading , the oil . The slick from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was still too far offshore to see or even smell . At least , it did n't smell worse than the harbor 's usual mix of boat fuel and bait . But there were rumors : It would come Sunday , first the sheen and then the thick stuff behind it . People here had heard that just to the west , fishermen were already pulling up shrimp that smelled like diesel fuel . On the Royster , a rust-edged fishing boat , Richard Bosarge said that he feared the oil could coat the valuable oyster grounds , which the fishermen here know so intimately they have given them names like `` Square Handkerchief '' and `` Pass Mary Anne . '' And the oil could poison the huge stocks of shrimp offshore . `` They 're out of reach until he 's probably my age , '' Bosarge , 42 , said , pointing to his son Roy , who is 15 . `` Just take a picture and put it in a museum . '' It has been 11 days since a BP oil and gas exploration well blew out , setting fire to the drilling rig , which sank , killing 11 people . Ever since , crude oil has been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico , raising the prospects of a historic environmental disaster . Winds from the southeast have nudged the slick northward , where it floated Saturday near the coasts of Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi as residents waited anxiously for it to arrive . `` Mother Nature gets a vote in this thing , and that 's probably the most unpredictable thing we 've got , '' said Adm. Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard . `` There 's enough oil out there to impact the shoreline . The real question is when and where . '' President Obama plans to visit the area Sunday morning to see any environmental damage for himself and check on the federal response . With the economy already weak , the widening oil slick could add to the region 's woes by damaging the fishing , tourism and shipping industries . The White House is eager to avoid the mistakes made by President George W. Bush , who was seen as too detached from floundering rescue efforts after the much more dire Hurricane Katrina . And that is the problem for Obama right now : Things are not going well in the battle to contain the oil spill . Allen , who Obama has named `` national incident commander '' for the spill , said Saturday that no progress had been made in cutting off the flow of oil from the damaged well , which is 5,000 feet below the ocean surface . Allen said weather and choppy seas were hindering efforts to contain the spill by laying out booms or skimming oil off the water , control techniques that have changed little over the past four decades . Allen said BP has not yet started drilling a relief well to cut off and plug the leaking one , and he reiterated that the new well would take weeks to complete . That poses political as well as environmental and economic challenges . Obama faces the politically tricky task of appearing in control of the response while avoiding the blame for the situation . While he repeatedly refers to BP as `` the responsible party '' under legislation approved in 1990 , administration officials have also been striving to demonstrate their attention to the crisis .

The rig belonged to Transocean , but BP had leased it to drill an exploration well and BP bore legal responsibility for any consequences . The grim updates were interspersed with long silences . One person there said that on several occasions , Hayward asked , `` What did we do to deserve this ? '' Twelve days later , Hayward is grappling with the widening oil slick from the damaged well -- an environmental crisis for the Gulf Coast states , a political crisis for U.S. offshore drilling and a corporate crisis for one of the world 's biggest oil giants . `` This accident not only sets back BP , but could hurt it for years , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer . On Sunday , the third anniversary of his becoming BP 's chief executive , Hayward began his day in Houma , La. , flew to a convention center in Mobile , Ala. , where a new oil spill command center has been set up , and then went on to Venice , La. . There , he planned to meet with local officials and others worried about the slick menacing the shore . On Monday , he will be in Washington , running the gantlet of federal officials and members of Congress , many of whom are eager to tar BP with blame for the incident . Before the accident , he had expected to be in the United States giving a speech and promoting a climate change bill . Now , he will face questions about whether BP underestimated the risk and consequences of a well failure . `` Whatever else this is , it 's a massive blow to confidence , '' said a senior BP insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to talk publicly . The price tag for the disaster increases day by day . The company says it is spending $ 6 million a day on response efforts . Drilling a relief well will probably cost more than $ 100 million . The Defense Department says it will hand BP the bill for paying Louisiana National Guard troops , and the Environmental Protection Agency says it will charge BP for air monitoring . Covering damages to coastal fishermen , tourism businesses and residents could cost billions more . BP will pay 65 percent of these costs ; its lease partners Anadarko Petroleum and Mitsui will pay 25 and 10 percent . BP 's share will come straight from its own pocket . `` We are self-insured as a matter of policy -- you can not insure these kinds of risks , '' a BP spokesman said . Alabama Attorney General Troy King said Sunday night that he told BP representatives to stop circulating agreements offering coastal Alabamians $ 5,000 if they give up the right to sue the company . A BP official said the offer was part of a `` standard waiver '' to fishermen that was `` inappropriate '' and was `` swiftly discontinued . '' The oil spill crisis is just the sort of thing Hayward had hoped to leave behind when he became BP chief executive . His predecessor , Lord John Browne , had been a brilliant deal maker and a friend of British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's , but BP was often accused of neglecting safety precautions and adding to risks through deep cost cutting . Under Browne , who resigned after revelations about his personal life in Britain 's tabloid news media , a fatal explosion took place at BP 's Texas City refinery , leaks sprang onto the tundra from a company pipeline in northern Alaska , and a BP production platform in the Gulf of Mexico suffered structural problems that delayed its start date .

President Obama flew in for a briefing about what he called `` a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster . '' In the region 's beach towns and coastline parishes , people waited and floated more booms to try to block the rogue oil that threatens their fragile economy and delicate marshlands . `` The best-case scenario : It gets stopped today . Worst-case scenario : This thing could keep going on for 90 days , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said as he made the rounds of the talk shows . With the oil patch growing , the federal government closed commercial and recreational fishing for at least 10 days in federal waters from the mouth of the Mississippi River to near Pensacola , Fla. . Obama met with a handful of fishermen during his short , rain-drenched tour of the Louisiana coast . Although the Obama visit was the capstone of a White House effort to convey full engagement , the most critical events are 42 miles from land and deep beneath the waves . Six robotic submarines , operated by engineers and technicians on ships at the surface , are circling and manipulating a balky 450-ton , four-story-tall structure called a `` blowout preventer '' that covers the wellhead and has devices designed to clamp the flow of oil in this kind of calamity . The blowout preventer has failed to live up to its name . `` This is like doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot-controlled submarines , '' Lamar McKay , chairman and president of BP America , said on ABC 's `` This Week . '' At a low-slung Coast Guard station along a waterway in Venice , a town two hours southeast of New Orleans , Obama had a briefing on the efforts to cap the oil well and the economic and environmental implications for the region . `` BP is responsible for this leak . BP will be paying the bill , '' Obama said before taking a brief helicopter tour over the water . The Deepwater Horizon floating rig , which BP leases , found oil beneath 5,000 feet of water and 13,000 feet of rock when something went awry April 20 , causing an explosion and fire . Most of the workers on the rig abandoned ship and were rescued , but 11 were killed . The rig , larger than a football field , sank two days later and sits upside down on the bottom . Crumpled by the disaster was the `` riser , '' the 21-inch pipe that emerges from the well with the smaller drill pipe inside . The riser is kinked at a 90-degree angle about five feet above the blowout preventer , and oil is bleeding from an irregular crack , BP spokesman Bill Salvin said . A second leak is 460 feet away on a section of the riser that lies on the gulf floor . A third leak is from the end of the drill pipe , 810 feet from the blowout preventer . Barring a sudden triumph with the blowout preventer , BP plans to try to capture the oil with containment domes , also known as cofferdams . The idea is to lower the huge 74-ton steel domes over the blowout preventer and the other two leaks , then pump the captured oil to a barge capable of holding 250,000 barrels . But the domes are still being fabricated in Louisiana and will not be deployed for six to eight days , McKay said Sunday . It 's not a simple feat : A BP spokesman said this kind of emergency response has never been tried at such a depth .

Even as BP finished construction on one massive containment dome Monday and started drilling a relief well to cope with the oil leaking from crumpled pipes at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , lawmakers and Gulf Coast residents began questioning whether the company will take full responsibility for the economic losses stemming from the spill . The incremental steps forward -- the company finished one four-story , 74-ton dome and hopes to complete two others on Tuesday -- came as company and Obama administration officials predicted it might take up to three months to seal off the spill threatening the Gulf Coast 's sensitive ecosystem . The prospect of an extended leak has intensified concerns over what compensation BP is willing to pay , since a law passed after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill requires companies to pay for cleanup costs but no more than $ 75 million for other damage . BP posted a fact sheet on its Web site saying it will take responsibility for the spill cleanup as well as provide compensation for `` legitimate and objectively verifiable '' claims for property damage , personal injury and commercial losses . On a day when the stock market rose sharply , the company 's shares fell $ 1.96 , or 3.8 percent , to close at $ 50.19 . It was the third worst performing stock in the S&P 500 . In his daily briefing Monday , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs underscored the administration 's `` commitment '' to affected residents that BP will pay them for their economic suffering . `` That 's part of the law . Absolutely , '' Gibbs said . `` The economic damages that are incurred are part of the cost of this incident . Also on Monday , four members of Obama 's Cabinet -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa P. Jackson and Energy Secretary Steven Chu -- met with BP chief executive Tony Hayward and Lamar McKay , BP America chairman and president , to discuss the ongoing response to the spill . Meanwhile , a group of Democratic senators including Robert Menendez -LRB- N.J. -RRB- and Bill Nelson -LRB- Fla. -RRB- introduced legislation Monday to raise oil companies ' liability limit retroactively to $ 10 billion . The economic implications of the disaster are potentially mammoth -- but highly uncertain . The annual commercial seafood harvest in the gulf is $ 661 million , recreational fishing contributes $ 757 million and nearly 8,000 jobs , and tourism related to wildlife adds $ 517 million , according to the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies . It remained unclear Monday how much damage those industries will incur from the oil spill , and how long that damage will last . The research group estimates that $ 1.6 billion in annual economic activity is tied to the wetlands directly exposed to the spill . `` The question is if the marshes are impacted and how long they will be impacted , '' said David Yoskowitz , an economist at the institute . `` It 's all kind of up in the air right now until we really start to see the oil coming to shore and see what happens . There is no doubt that there will be some economic impact . '' If economic activity were reduced by only a few billion dollars , it would be damaging for the regional economies of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama , but would be a drop in the bucket of the $ 14 trillion U.S. economy . But some analysts see the potential for even more dire outcomes . David R. Kotok , chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors , laid out scenarios in a note to clients that range from damages in the tens of billions of dollars and years of cleanup to a cost in the hundreds of billions of dollars that leaves the gulf as a `` damaged sea '' for a generation . The spill , he said , has made the likelihood of a dip back into recession higher than it had been . `` A ` double-dip ' recession probably has been made more likely by this tragedy , '' Kotok wrote .

Bea , a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley who spent 16 years working for Shell Oil . `` We 're still chasing it around with Scott towels . '' Unlike the 1969 Santa Barbara and 1989 Exxon Valdez spills , which were close to shore and coated coastlines , the well that blew up April 20 while being drilled by Transocean 's Deepwater Horizon rig is much farther out and has given BP and federal authorities an extra week or more to respond to the oil leaking into the gulf . Yet the more than 100 boats and dozens of aircraft deployed by BP and the U.S. Coast Guard have been unable to prevent it from creeping up to land and threatening the environment . `` The absolute objective is to contain it in the offshore environment , '' BP chief executive Tony Hayward said optimistically Wednesday . By Friday , it had started to touch Louisiana 's shores . `` From the mid - '80s , it is the same thing , '' said Lois Epstein , an Alaska-based engineering and policy consultant to nonprofit conservation organizations . `` At the time of the Valdez spill , we were utilizing booming and dispersants and controlled burns -- the same three major techniques as now . '' The reason little has changed , said Byron W. King , an energy analyst at Agora Financial , is a `` failure of imagination . '' `` The industry says it never had a blowout , '' he said , and as a result the oil `` industry is not going to spend good money on problems that it says are n't there . '' But King said that `` you need new technology to deal with the problems that your other new technology got you . '' And he said that the federal government , instead of just collecting its royalties , should have made sure that research took place . The most visible tool for containing the oil slick is the long string of floating plastic booms . Half a million feet of booms are on hand and about half of them have been set out so far , but they work best in calm seas . `` They presume oil is floating on the surface and the sea is still , '' said Hammond Eve , a former specialist in the environmental impact of offshore drilling at the Minerals Management Service who lives just east of New Orleans . `` The sea is certainly not still now . They do n't stick up very high . The waves are going right over them , the oil 's going right over them . They do n't work very well . '' Burning oil on the water surface is dramatic but of limited use . It also requires calm seas to corral oil where it 's thickest and drag it to a spot where it can be ignited with flares . Last week BP and the Coast Guard did that in what they described as a test ; they burned 100 barrels of oil , a tiny fraction of what 's pouring from the well . They said later burns could consume as much as 1,000 barrels of oil , still less than the 5,000 barrels a day that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates is leaking into the gulf . Bad weather has made it impossible to do a second burn . And the technique sends thick , black clouds of smoke into the atmosphere -- also bad for the environment and possibly the lungs .

View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk . The Interior Department exempted BP 's calamitous Gulf of Mexico drilling operation from a detailed environmental impact analysis last year , according to government documents , after three reviews of the area concluded that a massive oil spill was unlikely . Now , environmentalists and some key senators are calling for a reassessment of safety requirements for offshore drilling . Sen. Judd Gregg -LRB- R-N.H. -RRB- , who has supported offshore oil drilling in the past , said , `` I suspect you 're going to see an entirely different regime once people have a chance to sit back and take a look at how do we anticipate and clean up these potential environmental consequences '' from drilling . BP spokesman Toby Odone said the company 's appeal for NEPA waivers in the past `` was based on the spill and incident-response history in the Gulf of Mexico . '' Once the various investigations of the new spill have been completed , he added , `` the causes of this incident can be applied to determine any changes in the regulatory regime that are required to protect the environment . '' `` I 'm of the opinion that boosterism breeds complacency and complacency breeds disaster , '' said Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- `` That , in my opinion , is what happened . '' Jack Gerard , president of the American Petroleum Institute , said it is important to learn the cause of the accident before pursuing a major policy change . `` While the conversation has shifted , the energy reality has not , '' Gerard said . `` The American economy still relies on oil and gas . '' While the MMS assessed the environmental impact of drilling in the central and western Gulf of Mexico on three occasions in 2007 -- including a specific evaluation of BP 's Lease 206 at Deepwater Horizon -- in each case it played down the prospect of a major blowout . In one assessment , the agency estimated that `` a large oil spill '' from a platform would not exceed a total of 1,500 barrels and that a `` deepwater spill , '' occurring `` offshore of the inner Continental shelf , '' would not reach the coast . In another assessment , it defined the most likely large spill as totaling 4,600 barrels and forecast that it would largely dissipate within 10 days and would be unlikely to make landfall . `` They never did an analysis that took into account what turns out to be the very real possibility of a serious spill , '' said Holly Doremus , a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley who has reviewed the documents . The MMS mandates that companies drilling in some areas identify under NEPA what could reduce a project 's environmental impact . But Interior Department spokesman Matt Lee-Ashley said the service grants between 250 and 400 waivers a year for Gulf of Mexico projects . He added that Interior has now established the `` first ever '' board to examine safety procedures for offshore drilling . It will report back within 30 days on BP 's oil spill and will conduct `` a broader review of safety issues , '' Lee-Ashley said . BP 's exploration plan for Lease 206 , which calls the prospect of an oil spill `` unlikely , '' stated that `` no mitigation measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid , diminish or eliminate potential impacts on environmental resources . '' While the plan included a 13-page environmental impact analysis , it minimized the prospect of any serious damage associated with a spill , saying there would be only `` sub-lethal '' effects on fish and marine mammals , and `` birds could become oiled . However it is unlikely that an accidental oil spill would occur from the proposed activities . '' Kiern Suckling , executive director of the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity , said the federal waiver `` put BP entirely in control '' of the way it conducted its drilling . `` The agency 's oversight role has devolved to little more than rubber-stamping British Petroleum 's self-serving drilling plans , '' Suckling said . BP has lobbied the White House Council on Environmental Quality -- which provides NEPA guidance for all federal agencies -- to provide categorical exemptions more often . In an April 9 letter , BP America 's senior federal affairs director , Margaret D. Laney , wrote to the council that such exemptions should be used in situations where environmental damage is likely to be `` minimal or non-existent . '' An expansion in these waivers would help `` avoid unnecessary paperwork and time delays , '' she added . Lawmakers on Capitol Hill were talking Tuesday about curtailing offshore oil exploration rather than making it easier . In addition to traditional foes of offshore drilling such as Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez -LRB- N.J. -RRB- and Bill Nelson -LRB- Fla. -RRB- , Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid -LRB- D-Nev . -RRB- and centrists such as Max Baucus -LRB- D-Mont . -RRB- and Richard G.

Wednesday , May 5 , 2010 ; 12:54 PM BP said Wednesday that it has capped one of the three leaks in the pipe from the damaged oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , but the company said that while doing so would simplify the problems on the sea floor it would not alter the rate at which crude oil is spilling into the gulf . The leak was the one farthest from the wellhead , coming from the end of the drill pipe that had collapsed to the seabed . Using robotic submarines , technicians at the surface were able to saw off the end of the drill pipe and install a valve that shut the flow of oil , said BP spokesman Bill Salvin . `` We feel great about sealing that leak . It is absolutely a success for us , but it 's not the ultimate success that we want . Our main goal is to stop the flow completely . This is a piece that gets us a little closer to that , '' Salvin said . The largest and most worrisome leak remains uncapped , with oil coming from a pipe known as the riser , about 460 feet from the balky blowout preventer that sits atop the wellhead . That 's the leak that will be targeted by the first containment dome that will be lowered 5,000 feet to the seabed . The other continuing leak is from a crack where the riser is kinked about five feet above the blowout preventer , Salvin said . Coast Guard spokesman Brandon Blackwell said BP 's success in stopping the leak was not expected to reduce the volume of oil flowing into the gulf . He compared it to a garden hose with more than one leak . Put your thumb over one leak , and the water will come out stronger from the others . `` The pressure is going to remain the same , just the volume is just going to be redistributed , '' Blackwell said . Separately , BP announced that it has given $ 25 million to each of the states of Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida to help deal with the spill and its potential impact on sensitive areas . BP said the grants would not affect claims made against the company and were intended to supplement BP 's other response spending . `` We are continuing to do all we can to stop the flow of oil from the well and also attack and capture the spilled oil offshore , '' BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said in a statement . `` However , it is also vital that we work together with government and potentially impacted communities to protect the shoreline from any impact of the spill . We hope these grants will support the effective deployment of pre-prepared response plans in each state . '' Blackwell , speaking from the Joint Incident Command Center in Robert , La. , said that calm weather in the gulf means authorities could attack the leak more aggressively than they had in days . He said they would use sub-sea dispersant chemicals , drop dispersants from the air , deploy boats to skim oil from the surface and try again to burn patches of oil . `` We 've got a lot going on today , '' Blackwell said . `` That 's really because of the cooperation of the weather . '' State officials in Mississippi and Louisiana , the closest states to the slick , said it had not moved very much in two days . Louisiana officials reported that surveillance flights saw `` streamers '' of oil entering Chandeleur Sound , which separates the state 's coastal marshes from barrier islands . But the oil had not yet touched any of the islands , which are roosting grounds for huge colonies of brown pelicans . The Coast Guard estimates that the heavy oil still remains five to 10 miles off the Louisiana coast . In Mississippi , the head of the state 's Department of Marine Resources said the oil is still likely 30 miles from his state 's coastline , where officials have been putting out miles of protective `` containment boom '' around marshes and ecologically rich bayous . `` The last two days , it 's actually moved a little bit further offshore , '' said department executive director Bill Walker , who said the reason was a shift in winds . `` It 's not really moving right now . It 's just sort of sitting there ... But that will change .

View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk . The urgent question along the polluted Gulf of Mexico : How bad will this get ? No one knows , but with each day that the leaking oil well a mile below the surface remains uncapped , scientists and energy industry observers are imagining outcomes that range from bad to worse to worst , with some forecasting a calamity of historic proportions . Executives from oil giant BP and other energy companies , meanwhile , shared their own worst-case scenario in a Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers , saying that if they fail to close the well , the spill could increase from an estimated 5,000 barrels a day to 40,000 barrels or possibly even 60,000 barrels . Three scientists in separate interviews Tuesday said the gulf 's `` loop current , '' a powerful conveyor belt that extends about 3,000 feet deep , will almost surely take the oil down through the eastern gulf to the Straits of Florida , a week-long trip , roughly . The oil would then hang a sharp left , riding the Florida Current past the Keys and north again , directly into the Gulf Stream , which could carry it within spitting distance of Palm Beach and up the East Coast to Cape Hatteras , N.C. For the moment , the oil flowing from the blown-out well in what the industry calls Mississippi Canyon Block 252 is still many miles north of the loop current . A three-day forecast by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration does not show the oil and the current crossing paths . But Robert Weisberg , an oceanographer at the University of South Florida who has been monitoring the situation , said a new filament of the current is reaching toward the oil slick . `` The loop current is actually going to the oil , versus the oil going to the loop current , '' Weisberg said . The crisis in the gulf is shot through with guesses , rough estimates and murky figures . Whether the oil blows onshore depends on fickle winds . This oil slick has been elusive and enigmatic , lurking off the coast of Louisiana for many days as if choosing its moment of attack . It has changed sizes : In rough , churning seas , the visible slick at the surface has shrunk in recent days . The oil by its nature is hard to peg . It 's not a single , coherent blob but rather an irregular , amoeba-shaped expanse that in some places forms a thin sheen on the water and in other locations is braided and stretched into tendrils of thick , orange-brown gunk . There may be a large plume of oil in the water column , unseen . A BP executive said the company has had success in treating the oil at the point of the leak with dispersant chemicals sprayed by a robotic submarine . A federal fleet has fought high waves in attempts to skim or burn the oil . Rough weather has actually been a blessing , said Ian MacDonald , an oceanography professor at Florida State University . In heavy surf , the oil has been breaking up , and toxic , volatile substances have been evaporating . `` It chews up the oil ; some of it sinks , '' MacDonald said . The good news ends there . `` What remains forms what 's called mousse , which is like chocolate mousse . It 's an emulsion , which is an emulsion of oil , air and water , in a thick , gelatinous layer , and that 's nasty stuff , '' MacDonald said . No one is sure how much oil is spilling . An early estimate by the Coast Guard of a 1,000-barrel-a-day flow was upped to 5,000 barrels with the discovery of an additional leak , but officials now caution against giving any estimate too much credence .

The battle against the giant Gulf of Mexico oil slick gained traction Wednesday , even as officials raced to prepare for a sudden course shift that could push the thick gunk into the shipping channel of the Mississippi River . Two weeks into the crisis that began with an explosion on the rig Deepwater Horizon , robotic submarines sealed one of three leaks on the sea bottom . The mile-deep plumbing fix did not diminish the amount of oil flowing from the blown-out well , but it simplified the next step in the emergency response . That step involves what has been called a containment dome . It 's not a dome at all , but a boxy , four-story-tall , 100-ton metal structure used in shallow water after Hurricane Katrina . Refurbished and equipped with mud flaps , the dome on Wednesday was to take a 12-hour journey by barge from an industrial port to the open gulf , where it was scheduled to arrive by early Thursday above the blown-out well . If all goes as planned , a crane mounted on a second barge will lower the dome 5,000 feet to cover the largest and most worrisome leak , a break in a 21-inch pipe known as the riser . That leak is 460 feet from the wellhead and is the source of the overwhelming majority of the oil escaping the well . The dome is supposed to capture the oil and pump it through pipes to a barge at the surface . This will take several days to get up and running , but by Monday a significant amount of the oil gushing into the gulf may start to wind up instead in the barge , said BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles . At a news conference , Suttles and other officials tried to manage expectations , noting that such a recovery operation has never been attempted at such a great depth . `` It 's very complex , and it will likely have challenges along the way , '' Suttles said . A few hours after its scheduled departure , workers were still trying to make sure the unwieldy dome was securely fastened on the barge . The oil itself remained offshore for another day , but it is spreading , creeping closer to the Mississippi River Delta and threatening Louisiana 's Chandeleur Sound and Breton Sound . The three-day forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projected that the oil will move into the Mississippi 's deepwater entrance , known as the Southwest Pass , and drift west of the delta , which would be dire for the fishing industry along that stretch of the Louisiana coast . On Tuesday , leaders of the National Wildlife Federation set out in a boat from Pass Christian , Miss. , and found oil about 18 miles off Mississippi . `` The first thing that hit us 18 miles from the Biloxi wetlands was the nauseating smell , like spilled gasoline at a gas station , but stronger , '' Jeremy Symons , a spokesman for the group , wrote in an e-mail . `` Then we ran into a seemingly endless sea of brown heavy sludge floating on the water . With open ocean behind us , the oil sludge spread in front of us as far as we could see . '' In Plaquemines Parish , La. -- the area that follows the Mississippi to its mouth , and the land nearest to the oil leak -- Parish President Billy Nungesser said he feared that the fishing ban east of the river 's mouth would be extended west . `` Half the people ca n't pay their light bills , '' he said . `` If they close the western side , the other half will be out of work . '' Better weather and calm seas , a meteorological anomaly recently , made possible a controlled burn of the oil on the surface for the first time in a week . A fleet of boats skimmed oil from the surface , and planes dropped chemical dispersants wherever the slick edged toward Louisiana 's coastal islands .

View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk . What do you call a gigantic man-made disaster that is threatening to despoil the ecosystems and wreck the economies of the Gulf Coast ? The answer is important , if you happen to be one of the companies responsible for it . The massive slick spreading toward Louisiana has gone by several names since crude oil began gushing from a damaged drilling rig on April 20 . Media accounts have referred to it as `` the Gulf oil spill , '' `` the Deepwater Horizon spill '' and the `` Gulf Coast disaster . '' President Obama , leaving little doubt about whom he considers responsible for the epic mess , put a brand name on it in remarks in Louisiana on Sunday . The president dubbed it `` the BP oil spill , '' after the company -LRB- formerly British Petroleum -RRB- that leased the now-damaged drilling platform . The Environmental Protection Agency refers to it the same way in its official pronouncements . The name of a disaster can be critical , both as a historic matter and the more immediate matters of image , public relations and legal liability . BP has said it will honor `` legitimate '' claims from people and businesses seeking compensation from disruption caused by the spill . But since there are likely to be many disputed claims -LRB- `` This is America -- come on , '' BP chief executive Tony Hayward told the Times of London on Wednesday -RRB- , having your company 's name inextricably linked to a disaster ca n't help when a jury begins assigning damages . BP could face the same fate as another oil giant , Exxon , whose name is forever stamped on the 1989 oil spill in Prince William Sound , Alaska . That spill was named for the Exxon Valdez , the tanker that hit a reef and ruptured . Other calamities -- plane crashes , the Tylenol poisonings -- have been shorthanded by a corporate or product name , too . But companies do n't always get top billing , even when they acknowledge responsibility . The leak of poisonous chemicals at a plant in Bhopal , India -- which killed as many as 12,000 people -- came to be known more by its place of origin than by the company that owned the plant , Union Carbide . Similarly , the partial meltdown of a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant in 1979 was named after the facility where the incident occurred , Three Mile Island . Few people remember the name of the company that operated the plant and was responsible for its safety , General Public Utilities . bp.com -RRB- avoids any linkage , calling it `` the spill '' or `` Gulf of Mexico response '' or `` BP 's MC252 response , '' a reference to the rig known formally as Mississippi Canyon 252 . In a series of television interviews on Monday , BP 's Hayward tried to thread a tricky needle , taking responsibility for the cleanup but shifting some of the blame to others . `` This was n't our accident , '' he said on ABC 's `` Good Morning America . '' `` This was a drilling rig operated by another company . It was their people , their systems , their processes . We are responsible not for the accident , but we are responsible for the oil and for dealing with it and for cleaning the situation up . '' `` You 're not responsible for the accident ? '' host George Stephanopoulos asked , a bit incredulously . Hayward explained that the explosion occurred on a rig owned by Transocean , a drilling company based in Switzerland , and that the rig was leased by BP . `` It was their equipment that 's failed ; it was their systems and processes that were running it , '' Hayward said . Major oil spills are infrequent in the United States , and there 's no standard way of naming them , said Bill Bush , a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute , a Washington industry group . The two usual ways are by location -LRB- `` the New Orleans spill '' -RRB- or by the name of the facility or ship involved -LRB- Exxon Valdez , Argo Merchant , Athos 1 -RRB- . Companies typically do n't get tarred ; the 1969 spill off the coast of Southern California came to be known not by the company that caused it , Union Oil of California , but by where it happened -LRB- `` the Santa Barbara spill '' -RRB- .

But since Tony Hayward took over as CEO in 2007 , BP has increased its spending on U.S. politics , a move that may help the firm weather the political storm over its devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The company has mobilized a massive Washington lobbying campaign over the past week in response to the worsening crisis , dispatching senior executives to meet with Obama administration officials and members of Congress , while Hayward and other executives make frequent media appearances to defend BP 's performance . The onslaught underscores the expanding political role of BP , which has spent nearly $ 20 million on Washington lobbying since January 2009 and now ranks second only to ConocoPhillips within the powerful oil and gas industry , according to lobbying disclosure data . Its list of hired lobbyists reads like a Who 's Who of the profession , from Democratic powerhouse Tony Podesta to former Reagan aide Kenneth Duberstein . The company 's political action committee has also stepped up its contributions to lawmakers of both parties , particularly to key representatives of oil-dependent states such as Louisiana and Alaska . Unlike most other oil companies , BP also shifted some of its donations to Democrats as the party gained control of Congress , though it still gives the most to Republicans . -LRB- Barack Obama 's presidential campaign did not accept corporate donations , but received about $ 77,000 from BP employees . -RRB- BP America , the company 's U.S. affiliate , has a special `` external advisory council '' that includes former House majority leader Thomas A. Daschle -LRB- D-S.D. -RRB- ; two former GOP senators , Warren Rudman -LRB- N.H. -RRB- and Alan K. Simpson -LRB- Wyo. -RRB- ; Christine Todd Whitman , an Environmental Protection Agency administrator under George W. Bush ; and Jamie S. Gorelick , a deputy attorney general during Bill Clinton 's administration , according to BP records . Leon Panetta , President Obama 's CIA director , also served on the council before taking his intelligence post . A BP spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the firm 's political activities in Washington . Athan Manuel , director of the Sierra Club 's Lands Protection Program , said BP 's more aggressive lobbying efforts in recent years have been a disappointment to environmental groups , which were heartened by the company 's earlier pledges to move `` beyond petroleum '' and into alternative forms of energy . `` They seem to have returned to a more traditional oil-company approach , '' Manuel said . `` They 've decided to become just as active as Exxon or anyone else . '' One major recipient of donations from BP is Sen. Mary Landrieu -LRB- D-La . -RRB- , who has taken more than $ 15,000 in PAC contributions and thousands more from BP employees , according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics . Landrieu said at a hearing earlier this year that the risks of offshore drilling were `` minimal , '' and since the spill has urged caution in moving to curtail the practice . Landrieu told MSNBC on Wednesday that she has received donations from environmentalists and oil companies . `` I 'm very proud to actually receive money from both sides of this debate , because they , I believe , understand that I 'm as honest a broker as I can be here , '' she said . `` I am not a handmaiden to the oil industry . '' Turkish American groups were outraged when a House committee voted this year to label an Ottoman-era slaughter of Armenians as `` genocide , '' complaining that they had been out-lobbied by the other side . Now activists have started a new advocacy group aimed at publicizing the views of ethnic Turks in the United States . The project , dubbed Ten Thousand Turks , is being spearheaded by the Turkish Coalition USA Political Action Committee , which has given federal candidates more than $ 270,000 since 2007 . The group aims to sign up 10,000 members by October . G. Lincoln McCurdy , the PAC 's treasurer , said Turkish Americans ' views have `` not been heard collectively in great numbers ... We intend to change that , and start a new chapter of Turkish American activism in American politics and civic life .

The catastrophic oil spill unfolding in the gulf has provided the environmental community with a rare opportunity to shift public opinion on climate and energy issues , an opening on which it has been quick to capitalize . National environmental groups -- including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Fund -- have rushed volunteers and scientific experts to the Gulf of Mexico to help with the cleanup in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon rig 's collapse . But they are also holding news conferences , filming TV spots and organizing protest rallies , all aimed at persuading lawmakers to block new offshore oil drilling and pass legislation curbing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions . `` It 's very difficult , in our society , to cut through the din and get people to listen and pay attention , '' said Friends of the Earth Managing Director David Hirsch , whose group is preparing TV ads on the issue . `` Unfortunately , these are the times when it happens . These are the moments when you can be heard . '' Jack Gerard , president of the American Petroleum Institute , questioned environmentalists ' tactics . `` It 's unfortunate that some would seize on a tragic accident to push a political agenda , '' Gerard said . `` We do n't have the facts yet . '' Although the exact cause of the blowout remains unclear , activists have used the spill to bolster their argument that the risks of offshore oil exploration outweigh its benefits , and that the United States would be better off focused on promoting alternative energy sources . `` This does serve as a wake-up call , to both the administration and Congress , to focus more effort on reducing the demand for oil , '' said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune . A little over a month ago , it appeared that environmentalists would have to accept the prospect of expanded oil drilling off the U.S. coasts , as President Obama identified new areas for exploration and the three senators working on a bipartisan climate bill -- John F. Kerry -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- , Lindsey O. Graham -LRB- R-S.C. -RRB- and Joseph I. Lieberman -LRB- I-Conn . -RRB- -- inserted offshore drilling provisions into their draft . But now the administration has said it will review its proposal , and two GOP governors -- California 's Arnold Schwarzenegger and Florida 's Charlie Crist -- have reversed course and said they oppose any drilling off their state 's shores . At least two Democratic senators , Robert Menendez -LRB- N.J. -RRB- and Bill Nelson -LRB- Fla. -RRB- , have said they wo n't support a climate proposal that encourages offshore drilling , and even some moderate Republican senators say they want to reexamine the role offshore drilling should play in the nation 's energy supply . `` Whether it should be there in the future is an open question , '' said Sen. Richard G. Lugar -LRB- R-Ind . -RRB- . BP was one of three major oil companies prepared to endorse the compromise Senate climate bill last month -- Lieberman described them to reporters in late March as `` our new friends '' -- and Lieberman indicated Tuesday that he did not think the senators would pull offshore oil drilling from the package before they formally introduced it . But a Democratic Senate aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity said when it comes to the bill 's drilling language , `` We will have to change things from where they were before , but we need to figure out what that is . '' The aide that the bill 's sponsors are encouraged by the fact that the spill has `` engaged and activated a large part of the environmental community . We feel like this is a really good opportunity for us . '' Reaching a drilling compromise that will attract Republican support without alienating Democrats such as Menendez and Nelson remains a challenge . For the moment , however , environmentalists appear to think they have the upper hand . The Sierra Club has not only mobilized 2,000 people to volunteer in the Gulf states , it will hold a `` Clean It Up '' rally Saturday in New Orleans along with simultaneous `` solidarity events '' such as demonstrations at BP gas stations around the country and mock oil spills that will involve temporarily laying black trash bags on beaches . Dozens of green groups now participate in a daily `` oil disaster war room call '' to plot their strategy . `` I 'm not crazy about what got it there , but we 've got to take , advantage of it , '' Ocean Conservancy President Vicki Spruill said of the spill 's moment in the media spotlight . `` We 've got to turn this crisis into an opportunity . '' But Obama and his top deputies have yet to talk about reducing the nation 's dependence on fossil fuels in connection with the oil spill , something that worries environmentalists such as Brune . `` There 's no mention yet of how to get to the root of this , '' he said . `` If we 're not getting to the root problem -- our addiction to oil -- we 're going to see this problem repeated again and again .

Thursday , May 6 , 2010 ; 11:30 AM PORT FOURCHON , LA. -- The 125-ton box that BP hopes will control the underwater oil geyser threatening the Gulf Coast arrived Thursday morning at the site of an offshore rig 's collapse . Later in the day , the 40-foot-tall containment dome will be lowered by a huge crane onto the spouting wellhead . Although a containment device has never been used so far below the surface , the company that made it -- Wild Well Controls -- believes that this one can capture and then pipe up to waiting tankers a substantial amount of the oil that would otherwise be released to the sea . Given the large and steady stream of oil coming out from the rupture , the well-being of thousands of Gulf Coast residents and countless creatures that live in the hyper-fertile region depend on the box 's success . Louisiana officials announced Thursday that they had discovered two more dead birds , covered in oil , near the Grand Gosier Islands . Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry tried to moderate expectations that the containment device would be a silver bullet . `` I know we are all hoping that this containment system will work , but I want to remind everybody that this containment system is a first of its kind deployed in 5,000 feet of water , '' Landry said , according to the Associated Press . The waters at the spill site were calm Thursday morning , AP reported . A spokesman for BP , which is working to contain the oil spill , told the news service that the drop is expected after noon Thursday . The device is the latest of a broad range of techniques being used to staunch the oil leak , created by the explosion of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon Rig on April 20 , killing 11 workers . The launch Wednesday night of the gleaming box from Port Fourchon , an industrial hub at the very southern tip of Louisiana , captured the uneasy balance of forces at work here , where the marshlands hit the sea . The barge inched away from the Wild West yard along a canal flanked by cranes , discarded oil rigs , tank farms and endless barbed wire -- a gas industry outpost of heavy equipment and hard-hat men . Helicopters come in and out regularly to the port , and oil rigs are visible on the horizon . The dome , which was used in shallower waters during Hurricane Katrina , was modified at the Wild Wells yard . Two more are being prepared . The barge then traveled the Bayou Lafourche to the deeper waters , passing some of the most fertile marshes in the nation -- where fish and crustaceans of all kinds flourish in the rich outflow of the Mississippi River . One side of the bayou is an industrial park ; the other side part of a national park . The road down to Port Fourchon runs alongside another bayou , now filled with hundreds of fishing boats . They supply a significant percentage of the nation 's seafood , but are now unable to go out to work . Even the harshness of Port Fourchon can not eliminate the fertility of the land : Drainage ditches filled with trash and garbage still are alive with crabs and schools of darting fish . While fishermen have been vocal in their dismay about the spill , the army of workers at Port Fourchon were officially mum as the dome moved out . Wild Wells referred all questions to the Unified Command Deepwater Joint Information Center many miles away in Robert , La. , and workers from companies nearby said they were told not to speak with reporters . One man , however , offered this reminder : `` You know , '' he said , after speaking on the condition of anonymity , `` we have as much riding on this as the fishermen and beachfront folks . If this can be controlled , we go back to business like before . If it creates a big mess , we 're in big trouble for quite a while .

View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk . Well , no , it ca n't . The oil slick spreading from a damaged drilling rig off the coast of Louisiana is already too massive for any quick fix , no matter how well intended . But the environmental calamity has inspired a quirky grass-roots campaign that seeks to use donated hair and animal fur to create oil-absorbing booms . The idea , promoted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit group called Matter of Trust , is to collect tons of hair and fur to stuff into nylon pouches , in this case used or defective pantyhose . When strung together in sausage-like skeins , the hair booms could be set in the water to collect the encroaching oil . Hair , as anyone who has n't shampooed in a while knows , absorbs and holds oily materials well . Matter of Trust is coordinating the collection of hair and fur through thousands of salons , pet groomers and ranchers . It has collected more than 450,000 pounds of the stuff from people around the world . The organization is storing the raw material in warehouses throughout the Gulf region . Meanwhile , volunteers in the area have hosted 19 `` Boom-B-Qs '' during which participants stuff hair into the nylon casings . `` We 're all growing this natural resource , '' says Lisa Gautier , who co-founded Matter of Trust with her husband , Patrice , 12 years ago . `` It does n't get more renewable than this . We think it 's a safe , non-toxic way to do the clean-up . '' The movement has picked up corporate support , too . Hanes has donated 50,000 pairs of pantyhose , and Petco , the pet-supply and grooming chain , says it will donate as much as a ton of fur clippings per day . It 's not clear how much of a dent in the problem the hair booms can make . Lisa Gautier says it takes about 15 pounds of hair to create a 12-foot boom . If all 450,000 pounds of hair were stuffed and deployed , that would create 360,000 feet of barrier , or about 68 miles ' worth . The joint industry-government task force that is supervising the cleanup effort has more than 150 miles of industrial booms to block and absorb the oil in place around the Gulf . What 's more , Matter of Trust is n't authorized to place booms ; only government agencies and volunteers certified by the official joint command are legally permitted to do so . But there 's plenty of need : `` We 're finding that everyone wants to boom everything , '' says Mark Proegler , a spokesman for BP , the oil company that is legally responsible for the cleanup . `` There 's just not sufficient boom to do that . Every parish thinks it 's the most important . '' BP has had no contact with Matter of Trust , but it appreciates the effort : `` We certainly do n't want to discourage any of the people who 've expressed a willingness to help , '' Proegler says . The feel-good aspects of the project are n't lost on Washington salon owner Jacqui Davis , whose 15-store chain , PR at Partners , is participating in the effort . `` It 's another way to be green and recycle , '' Davis says . `` We 're happy to help out . We 're telling our clients who want to take just a couple of inches off to cut it shorter and pick up some more oil . It 's great to be able to say you contributed in some way . '' If everything goes as planned in the great hair boom deployment , it does raise another question : Who cleans up all of that hair ? The booms , Lisa Gautier says , would be BP 's responsibility . The company would likely incinerate the booms after picking them up , she says .

Deepwater Horizon was true to its name . The giant drilling rig , floating on submerged pontoons , set up shop 42 miles from land in the Gulf of Mexico . It was an award-winning rig that epitomized the technological hubris of the oil industry , successfully chasing the hydrocarbons far beyond the continental shelf in what can accurately be termed the abyss . The drilling of Mississippi Canyon Block 252 this spring looked like an unqualified success . The rig struck oil and gas beneath 5,000 feet of water and 13,000 feet of rock . Executives of BP planned to make a splashy announcement . The Macondo field , as they called it , held 50 million to 100 million barrels of crude . Then came the blowout . The gulf is now witnessing a slow-motion disaster , one that looked even grimmer Saturday with the bulletin that the containment dome that had been lowered onto the worst of the oil leaks has been sidelined by technical problems . No one is sure what exactly happened on the night of April 20 to trigger this crisis . Critical pieces of evidence , including the immolated rig itself , sit under nearly a mile of water on the mud floor of the gulf . What 's certain is that more than one thing had to go wrong . Some failure of well control permitted a bubble of gas to surge to the surface , where it ignited and turned Deepwater Horizon into a Roman candle in the night . Moreover , the fail-safe mechanism known as the blowout preventer , a massive stack of valves and pistons that is the most critical hardware in the system , failed to choke the well . There have been blowouts since the dawn of the oil drilling industry , but never a blowout like this . This one is the deepest on record , industry officials say . A blowout last August in the Timor Sea had some similarities , but it was in much shallower water . Capping the unsealed well , said Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen , is as tricky as getting the Apollo 13 astronauts home safely in their damaged spaceship . `` We have gone to a different planet in going to the deepwater . An alien environment , '' oil industry analyst Byron King said . `` And what do you know from every science fiction movie ? The aliens can kill us . '' To extract hydrocarbons from the ground , even on land , is to take on powerful terrestrial forces . The oil and gas are in hot , porous rock , under pressure and trapped -- until someone sticks a straw into the reservoir . The deeper the well , the higher the pressure . Engineers talk of the importance of having multiple layers of controls , or `` barriers , '' when drilling . They do n't pump the oil up , because they do n't need to . Instead , they shove heavy drilling mud , a synthetic goo , into the well to act as a counterweight to the pressure from below . As the ultimate layer of defense they install the muscular blowout preventer with its hydraulic shears that can cut right through thick pipe . But sometimes nature is harder to tame than expected . The consequences of a blowout can be dire in shallow water . At great depth , the consequences are only now , with each passing day , becoming fully apparent . A geyser , a hiss , a flash Something dirty was falling from the sky -- that 's what Alwin Landry , captain of the supply ship Damon B Bankston , remembers of the night of April 20 . `` Just a dirty rain , '' he recalls . The stuff spattered the back half of his boat , which floated just 40 feet from Deepwater Horizon . `` What is this , '' Landry said to a crewman .

BP 's effort to contain the oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico ran into technical obstacles over the weekend that increased the likelihood of a prolonged battle to stop the leak . Faced with the prospect of a widening slick , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- proposed a more radical response : dredging the Mississippi River to create a string of barrier islands to protect the coastline . The best hope for quickly stemming the flow of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico dimmed late Friday when icelike crystals clogged a containment box that was designed to funnel oil into barges on the water 's surface . BP said it had moved the four-story-tall steel box 200 meters away from the leaking pipe and set it down on the muddy sea floor while the company tries to figure out how to solve the problem . Finding a solution could be difficult , however , because extremely high pressure and low temperatures on the sea floor spur the combination of water and natural gas from the damaged well into slushy substances called hydrates . `` I would n't say it 's failed yet , '' BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said of the containment box . `` What I would say is what we attempted to do last night did n't work because these hydrates plugged up the top of the dome . '' The setback means that oil will continue leaking from the damaged exploration well that blew out on April 20 , setting afire and sinking the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . The well is estimated to be pouring 5,000 barrels a day of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico . A Coast Guard official said Saturday that tar balls believed to be from the giant spill had started to wash up on an Alabama island three miles from the coast . Chief Warrant Officer Adam Wine said about a half dozen tar balls had been collected at Dauphin Island . Faced with the slow but steady advance of the oil slick , Jindal proposed dredging soil from the Mississippi River to create a ring of islands to protect the state 's shorelines . He said the plan would create some new barrier islands and connect existing ones , including some that are federal wildlife preserves . He said that 12 dredges had been identified to begin the work and that he had sent the plan to federal officials for `` quick approval . '' Speaking at the Cypress Cove Marina in Venice , La. , Jindal added that he expected BP to pay for the project , which he estimated would cost `` hundreds of millions of dollars . '' Earlier , Jindal flew over the Chandeleur Islands , about 10 miles off the coast , and said `` stranded oil '' was ringing some of them . `` It was almost like a ring around a bathtub , '' he said . He said that changing weather conditions will bring the oil onto islands repeatedly and that `` we now expect oil to impact repeatedly . '' Jindal said he was `` very disappointed '' that BP 's containment box had run into problems . BP said that it had anticipated problems from crystals of gas hydrates , but not this soon or this fast . The company said that natural gas surging up along with crude oil from the underground reservoir had combined with sea water to form the icelike crystals . Those crystals had blocked an opening at the top of the 100-ton steel box that had been placed over the oil leak on the sea floor . The opening was supposed to connect to a pipeline that would have funneled the oil and gas to a ship on the surface of the water 5,000 feet above .

'' BP 's financial wounds from April 20 drilling-rig explosion might be serious , but they probably wo n't be fatal . One analyst report , issued by Citigroup , even declared in its title , `` Reaction to the Gulf of Mexico oil leak is a buying opportunity . '' Even though most investors have soured on BP , driving down its stock price by 19 percent and wiping out $ 36.7 billion of its market value since the explosion , the business remains a behemoth . The company has a market value of $ 152.6 billion , bolstered by a global marketing network , a lucrative oil venture in Russia , a promising contract to boost production in a giant Iraqi field and scores of other large interests . It remains the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico . Measured by revenue or assets , it is among the world 's five largest companies . Citigroup analysts said stockholders ' reactions seem `` disproportionate to the likely costs to the company . '' It noted that punitive damages against Exxon for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil-tanker spill were originally set at $ 5 billion in 1994 but were reduced on appeal . The company agreed last year to pay less than $ 1 billion , including interest . For now , at least , BP 's prodigious costs combating the oil spill in the Gulf are outweighed by prodigious profits . On Monday , BP said it spent $ 350 million in the first 20 days of the spill response , about $ 17.5 million a day . It has paid 295 of the 4,700 claims received , for a total of $ 3.5 million . By contrast , in the first quarter of the year , the London-based oil giant 's profits averaged $ 93 million a day . The amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico has been estimated at 5,000 to 25,000 barrels a day . In the first quarter , BP produced 2.5 million barrels of crude oil a day worldwide -- and it received $ 71.86 for every barrel . BP has strong borrowing capacity , too . Analysts say it could get as much as $ 20 billion without exceeding its debt targets . `` Even a pretty large digging into the pockets would be within our capacity to handle , '' said Andrew Gowers , a BP spokesman . The company does , however , have large needs -- with a $ 20 billion capital spending plan for this year and $ 8.4 billion needed for acquisitions , mainly of assets from Devon Energy . Now , cleanup costs must be added . Relief wells being drilled to intercept the damaged one could cost more than $ 100 million each . Scores of lawsuits have been filed . Legislation passed in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez accident makes BP and its partners responsible for cleanup costs and up to $ 75 million in damages . BP officials said Monday that they expect to exceed that . `` A $ 75 million liability is not where our head is at this moment , '' said David Nagel , an executive vice president . On Friday , Standard & Poor 's affirmed BP 's credit rating but revised its outlook to `` Negative '' from `` Stable . '' `` Provided BP can stem the well and clean the spill within a reasonable time , the company has adequate liquidity and financial headroom to meet immediate costs , '' said a report by S&P credit analyst Simon Redmond . `` However , it is still too early to estimate with any degree of confidence the full future impact on BP from the spill . '' BP will survive , analysts say , but damage caused by the rig disaster that killed 11 workers was still huge . Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer , said the accident was `` a major disaster with catastrophic implications not only for the companies involved , but also for the offshore oil industry and the economies of the Gulf Coast .

Woodward\\/the Washington Post -RRB- Lamar McKay , the BP official who visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday , could n't have been any more slippery if he had just bathed in the Gulf of Mexico . What changes has the oil company made to stop its record of accidents , the latest causing 5,000 barrels a day to pour into the gulf ? `` Our operating management system in the Gulf of Mexico is as good as anyone , '' McKay replied . `` I ca n't point to any deficiencies . '' Did BP ask federal regulators to reverse procedures shortly before its oil rig in the gulf exploded ? `` I 'm not familiar with the individual procedure on that well , '' answered McKay , the president of BP America . Will BP compensate state and local governments for lost tax revenue from the devastated fishing and tourism industries ? Here 's another question mark : What is BP thinking ? The British oil firm has shown a crude lack of accountability as it tries to shift blame for the spill . But perhaps the most unnerving part of McKay 's performance was how familiar it seemed . Just a week ago , Goldman Sachs officials came to Congress and declared that they have no responsibility for the mortgage-market meltdown and the resulting collapse of the world economy . Others in the banking industry , saved from bankruptcy by government intervention , are now bitterly fighting new regulations designed to prevent a recurrence . Before that , auto industry executives flew to Washington on corporate jets to demand government money . This all seems to be part of a new era of corporate irresponsibility , in which amoral executives pursue profits without a thought about collateral damage , then demand government help when they get in trouble . In a pair of Senate hearings Tuesday , BP 's McKay traded blame with the oil platform operator , Transocean , and drilling contractor Halliburton . Their finger-pointing led one senator to compare them to children blaming one another for the baseball that went through the neighbor 's window . `` Transocean , as owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , had responsibility for the safety of drilling operations , '' McKay declared .

Three major oil industry executives agreed on one thing in a pair of Senate hearings Tuesday : Someone else was to blame for the drilling rig accident that triggered the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The senior executives from the oil behemoth BP , the offshore oil drilling company Transocean and the oilfield services contractor Halliburton pointed fingers at each other in seeking to explain what caused the accident that set afire and sank the Deepwater Horizon rig , killing 11 people . Getting to the bottom of the accident took center stage for a day even as BP and federal agencies sought to contain or stop the three-week-old oil spill . BP blamed the failure of Transocean 's blowout preventer and raised a new question about whether Transocean disregarded `` anomalous pressure test readings '' just hours before the explosion . Transocean blamed decisions made by BP and cited possible flaws in the cementing job done by Halliburton . And Halliburton said that it had faithfully followed BP 's instructions and that Transocean had started replacing a heavy drilling mud with seawater before the well was sealed with a cement plug . Senators , striving to become fluent in the language of offshore drilling technology , pressed the executives to explain the failures of the exploration well and pressed BP America 's president , Lamar McKay , to explain the precise meaning of his pledge that BP would pay `` all legitimate claims '' stemming from oil spill damage . Lawmakers opposed to wider offshore drilling said they were sadly vindicated . `` The bottom line is : If you drill in the ocean , an oil spill can not be a surprise , '' Sen. Frank Lautenberg -LRB- D-N.J. -RRB- said . `` All it takes is one oil spill to destroy a coastline . '' Sen. Bill Nelson -LRB- D-Fla . -RRB- said , `` One of my worst nightmares might be coming true . '' Congress ought to consider raising the $ 75 million limit on oil companies ' liability for economic damages to $ 10 billion , he said . Lawmakers who favor offshore drilling worried about the damage that could be done to public support . `` We need the oil that comes from offshore to keep this economy moving , '' Sen. Mary Landrieu -LRB- D-La . -RRB- said , arguing that one-thousandth of 1 percent of oil produced had been spilled . Sen. Lisa Murkowski -LRB- Alaska -RRB- , the ranking Republican on the energy committee , said that `` under anyone 's most optimistic scenario , our nation will need oil and gas for a long time to come . '' McKay placed blame for the accident squarely on Transocean . That company , `` as owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , had responsibility for the safety of all drilling operations , '' he said . `` We do n't know yet precisely what happened on the night of April 20 , but what we do know is that there were anomalous pressure test readings several hours prior to the explosion , '' he added in a new disclosure . `` These could have raised concerns about well control prior to the operation to replace mud with seawater in the well in preparation for the setting of the cement plug . '' McKay also repeated BP 's complaint that if all else failed , Transocean 's blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- should have cut off the well , although several lawmakers noted that while BP has called the BOP a `` fail-safe '' device , many of them had failed in shallower waters or on land . Transocean chief executive Steven Newman said the blowout preventers `` were clearly not the root cause of the explosion . '' He said that by April 17 , the well had been completed and the blowout preventer was ready to be moved off site . `` The attention now being given to the BOPs in this case is somewhat ironic , because at the time of the explosion , the drilling process was completed , '' he said .

Since then , no one has been able to stop the flow of oil into the clear waters . Nearly 4 million gallons of oil have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico . If the nonstop efforts to stop it are not successful soon , it could become the nation 's worst oil spill . In 1989 , a leaking oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons along the coast of Alaska . How did the oil spill happen ? After the explosion , the oil rig , called Deepwater Horizon , collapsed . The pipe that was directing oil up to the rig broke in several places , allowing the oil to rush into the open water . If you 've ever seen a fire hydrant or even a kitchen sink gushing water , you have an idea of what happened . Is n't there a way to stop the oil ? The backup system that should have stopped the flow of oil failed . Trying to fix it is hard because it 's so far underwater . Think about how much pressure you feel when you dive to the bottom of a swimming pool -- then imagine being a mile underwater . Remote-controlled robots are being used to try to fix this emergency shut-off valve . They have n't been successful so far . What else can be done ? The company that was using the rig to dig for oil , a giant British company called BP , tried to put a four-story steel and concrete box over the biggest leak and then attach a pipe to the top of the box that would bring the oil up to ships on the surface . But the box clogged up with ice formed by low temperatures and high pressure under water . BP is also spraying chemicals on the oil to make it break up in the water , the way dish soap cuts through grease when you wash the dishes . But pouring huge amounts of chemicals into the water can also cause harm . As a last resort , BP is digging what 's called a relief well nearby that would intersect with the original well and stop the flow of oil from the original well . But digging this new well will take up to three months . So what happens to all the oil ? The spill covers thousands of square miles and threatens the coast of Louisiana , which is home to hundreds of species of wildlife . It also threatens many jobs , such as fishing , that depend on clean water . Ships are laying hundreds of miles of booms , which look like bright orange sausage links floating on the water , to soak up oil and keep it from reaching land . But some oil is sloshing over the booms . Sandbags also are being put down to perhaps create a wall in front of the marshlands . A few more unusual approaches are also underway , including booms made of pantyhose packed with animal and human hair , which absorbs oil . BP is considering stuffing the well with golf balls , shredded tires and knotted rope . The idea is to try to clog the oil pipe the way a sink gets clogged . What happens to the animals ? It 's possible that many animals will die as a result of the spilled oil ; they get coated in it and accidentally eat or drink it . Wildlife experts are working in the area . If the oil leak is contained soon , the damage to wildlife will be limited .

Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- pressed BP on why it seemed to be `` flailing '' to deal with a spill only 2 percent as large as what it had said it could handle in its license application . `` The American people expect you to have a response comparable to the Apollo project , not ` Project Runway , ' '' Markey said . Steven Newman , chief executive of Transocean , said the blowout preventer underwent regular tests . He said links to the drilling rig would have indicated if the device 's batteries were dead , though he said data records were lost when the rig sank . It was the second day of congressional hearings in response to the April 20 blowout that set fire to Transocean 's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which later sank , killing 11 people and triggering the oil spill that now threatens wildlife and livelihoods along the Gulf Coast . So far , 25 birds have been found `` oiled '' in Louisiana , including seven that survived , said Sharon Taylor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . In addition , she said 87 sea turtles and six dolphins have been found dead , though lab tests will be needed to determine whether they died from oil or other causes . Oil is still pouring into the gulf as federal agencies and others investigate the cause of the accident . On Wednesday , BP released the first video of the primary leak on the muddy sea floor , 5,000 feet deep . The photos show a dark , frothy plume of oil mixed with a lighter-colored substance that officials did not describe but experts said is natural gas . The video has been sought by experts who say it might help them measure the size of the leak . BP 's initial estimate was 1,000 barrels a day , and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later put it at roughly 5,000 barrels a day . `` That flow rate looks pretty much the same as its always looked , '' BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said after showing reporters the clip . Ian R. MacDonald , a professor of oceanography at Florida State University who has been arguing that the NOAA estimate is too low , said after viewing the video , `` I do n't know how they get only 5,000 barrels a day out of that . That 's really quite a gusher . '' But Greg McCormack , director of Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas , said , `` There are so many unknowns there , you ca n't calculate it . '' In an effort to contain the leak , BP said Wednesday that it had lowered a new steel structure into the water near the damaged well to prepare for a second attempt at funneling some of the oil into a pipeline and onto a ship . An earlier attempt was foiled by slush-like gas hydrates -- combinations of seawater and natural gas from the well -- that quickly clogged an opening in a larger steel box . In Washington , Stupak said the committee investigators had uncovered a document prepared in 2001 by Transocean , the drilling rig operator , that said there were 260 `` failure modes '' that could require removal of the blowout preventer . `` How can a device that has 260 failure modes be considered fail-safe ?

No votes are expected in either the House or the Senate . The big news , however , is that the Environmental Protection Agency is readying to move on greenhouse gases . They 're starting with sources emitting at least 100,000 tons -- originally , they discussed using 25,000 tons -- but even so , this is exactly what the business community fears , and exactly what they wanted a climate-change bill to protect them from .

We 're also getting Commerce Department data on April retail sales , Fed data on April industrial production , and a Treasury Department report card on how well its foreclosure program is working . It 's early in the morning , and this is Wonkbook . The EPA is cracking down on greenhouse gas emissions , reports Sindya Bhanoo : `` The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a final rule on Thursday for regulating major emitters of greenhouse gases , like coal-fired power plants , under the Clean Air Act . Starting in July 2011 , new sources of at least 100,000 tons of greenhouse gases a year and any existing plants that increase emissions by 75,000 tons will have to seek permits , the agency said .

Repeated endlessly in news reports , it has become conventional wisdom . But scientists and environmental groups are raising sharp questions about that estimate , declaring that the leak must be far larger . They also criticize BP for refusing to use well-known scientific techniques that would give a more precise figure . The criticism escalated on Thursday , a day after the release of a video that showed a huge black plume of oil gushing from the broken well at a seemingly high rate . BP has repeatedly claimed that measuring the plume would be impossible .

If Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus did n't move soon , Emanuel wanted to be ready with a measure to send directly to the Senate floor , bypassing the committee . He calculated that the simple act of putting together a rival blueprint might be enough to jolt Baucus into action .

The number of homes repossessed , the final stage of the foreclosure process , reached 92,432 in April .

'' HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan sees the case for modifying the mortgage-interest deduction , writes Laura Meckler : `` Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan said today that modifying the home interest deduction could satisfy two objectives : reducing the deficit and rebalancing federal housing policy . But he also made clear that the Obama administration isn t actively considering , much less endorsing , such a step , which could affect millions of homeowners . Some out 40.8 million tax returns claimed the home interest deduction for 2007 , according to the Tax Foundation . '' Businesses need to prepare for the post-cheap money era . write Andrew Schwedel and Karen Harris : `` Exhibit A is the cost of capital . No matter how strong the coming cycle , borrowing costs will be at least two to three percentage points higher than during the last period of robust growth . That 's partly because the crisis demonstrated that pre-2007 risk premiums were perilously low and will have to adjust upward across the spectrum of financial markets . Government borrowing will increasingly ` crowd out ' the private debt markets in the developed world as governments compete with private borrowers for available funds . And the credit markets are still very much on edge . '' The US ai n't Greece , writes Paul Krugman : `` The U.S. economy has been growing since last summer , thanks to fiscal stimulus and expansionary policies by the Federal Reserve . I wish that growth were faster ; still , it s finally producing job gains and it s also showing up in revenues . Right now we re on track to match Congressional Budget Office projections of a substantial rise in tax receipts . Put those projections together with the Obama administration s policies , and they imply a sharp fall in the budget deficit over the next few years . '' `` Greece , on the other hand , is caught in a trap . During the good years , when capital was flooding in , Greek costs and prices got far out of line with the rest of Europe . If Greece still had its own currency , it could restore competitiveness through devaluation . But since it doesn t , and since leaving the euro is still considered unthinkable , Greece faces years of grinding deflation and low or zero economic growth . So the only way to reduce deficits is through savage budget cuts , and investors are skeptical about whether those cuts will actually happen . '' `` It s worth noting , by the way , that Britain which is in worse fiscal shape than we are , but which , unlike Greece , hasn t adopted the euro remains able to borrow at fairly low interest rates . Having your own currency , it seems , makes a big difference . '' Andrew Cuomo is investigating eight banks about misleading ratings agencies , reports Tomoeh Murakami Tse : `` Cuomo 's investigation is focusing on the relationships between the banks and the agencies that rated certain mortgage-related securities packaged by the banks and sold to clients , said the sources , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing . Investigators are looking at whether the banks gave false information to the agencies about the assets in the securities to get better ratings , the sources said . '' There 's a case for the over-the-counter derivatives market , writes Mark Brickell : `` Using private credit information , banks can decide to make a swap without taking collateral , just as they would to make an unsecured loan . Futures traders , in contrast , outsource the credit risk of all their derivatives to central counterparties called clearinghouses , which require cash collateral or ` margin ' payments . If American companies were required to make such margin payments on their swaps , they would have to set aside billions of dollars that would no longer be available , as 3M testified last year , to build more factories or create new jobs . '' The EPA is egging on the Senate , writes Brad Plumer : `` A couple of things are happening here . One , it 's now going to be very tough for new coal-fired power plants to get built in the United States . Given that those plants are a major source of carbon pollution , that 's a significant step . Second , the EPA 's clearly pressing ahead with its own regulations and that might give the Senate the kick it needs to pass a climate bill . But the agency 's also being cautious and moving very deliberately on this stuff indeed , it 's backing off from it 's previously planned 25,000-ton threshold . '' The American Power Act is being boosted by big business , report Kasie Hunt and Jeanne Cummings : `` While the green lobby is already firing up grass-roots support and running ads to advance the bill , getting the 60 Senate votes needed to pass it will require help from corporate lobbying shops with deep ties to conservative Democrats and Republicans ... The competing interests of the crowd were noted by Lew Hay , chairman and chief executive officer of Florida Power & Light , a power company that relies mostly on natural gas , nuclear and renewable energy . He jokingly applauded Kerry and Lieberman for ` threading the needle ' so adroitly that he could share a stage with coal-powered Duke Energy s CEO Jim Rogers . '' The White House is caught in a strange and unexpected partnership with BP , reports Juliet Eilperin : `` It was a relationship for which neither the White House nor BP was well prepared . And it stands in contrast to the arm 's - length distance that the U.S. government kept from Exxon after the Valdez spill in 1989 . Thomas A. Campbell , who served as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's general counsel at the time , said it would have been politically toxic for the government to collaborate : ` We were n't able to even talk to Exxon , except on purely technical issues . ' '' `` Why the change ? The success or failure of the Obama administration 's response -- involving about 13,000 workers and 460 vessels , along with 1.4 million feet of boom laid against the spreading slick -- depends largely on BP 's expertise and technology . '' Transocean , the operator of the Gulf oil rig , is trying to avoid paying up , report Mark Long and Angel Gonzalez : `` Transocean Ltd. , the owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that burned and sank last month unleashing a massive oil leak into the Gulf of Mexico , Thursday filed in federal court a petition to limit its liability to just under $ 27 million . The world 's biggest offshore driller filed the request in the U.S. District Court in Houston under a century-and-a-half-old law that allowed the Titanic 's owners to limit their liability following that ship 's 1912 sinking . '' Insurers are trying to water down the medical loss requirement in health care reform , reports David Hilzenrath : `` Starting next year , insurers covering individuals and small groups must have medical loss ratios of at least 80 percent , and insurers in the large group market must have ratios of at least 85 percent ... Insurers already won a round in the drafting of the new law . It allows them to count not just medical bills but also ` activities that improve health-care quality . ' That language leaves considerable room for interpretation . '' Obamacare still saves money , writes Tim Noah : `` Boehner 's calculation of the additional cost to the health care law -LRB- widely repeated in the press -RRB- is simply wrong . Boehner says it 's $ 115 billion , which would reduce the law 's 10-year budget savings to a mere $ 28 billion . That would be a startling change . But roughly $ 85 billion of that $ 115 billion is money that 's already being spent . The true spending increase attributable to Obamacare is therefore more like $ 30 billion . '' Donald Berwick is being opposed as a `` rationing expert , reports Kate Pickert : `` The reason ? Berwick is , by all accounts , a huge fan of the National Health Service , Britain 's single-payer health care system . During the health reform debate , NHS was a dirty acronym associated with rationing and horror stories of patients denied needed care due to cost . The NHS is far from perfect , but it does , by World Health Organization measures , provide generally better overall care to the entire population of the UK than the U.S. system at a fraction of the per capita cost . '' Good child care helps kids academically , reports Shirley Wang : `` Having high-quality child care as a youngster can yield dividends when kids become teenagers , according to a new report . A study released Friday found that benefits associated with child-care providers and preschool programs that encourage such activities as language , reading and game-playing last well into adolescence . In particular , teenagers who had such child-care performed significantly better academically than those given low-quality or no care outside the home . Researchers said the study , which tracked more than 1,000 children from birth through age 15 , is the first to document the long-term effects of routine child care . '' We need free trade in brainpower as well as goods , writes Ben Wildavsky : `` This intense scholarly competition and exchange call it free trade in minds is shaking up the academy . But the anxiety it creates on college campuses and beyond has led to periodic outbursts of academic protectionism ... An even bigger problem is what might be called psychological protectionism : the sentiment that if foreign nations are getting ahead academically , we in the West must be falling behind . `` Ian Gow , the founding president of Nottingham University 's Ningbo campus in China , has cautioned that China 's partnerships with British universities are a one-way street , intended to vacuum up Western science and technology strengths that China is desperate to gain : ` British institutions must stop viewing this aggressively ambitious country through rose-tinted spectacles . ' This apprehensive response to the globalization of universities is misguided . It amounts to modern-day mercantilism , the outmoded idea that in order to prosper a nation must grab the maximum share of a finite amount of global capital . Nothing could be further from the truth . '' Opposing immigration is political suicide for the GOP , writes Michael Gerson : `` Immigration issues are emotional and complex . But this must be recognized for what it is : political suicide . Consider that Hispanics make up 40 percent of the K-12 students in Arizona , 44 percent in Texas , 47 percent in California , 54 percent in New Mexico . Whatever temporary gains Republicans might make feeding resentment of this demographic shift , the party identified with that resentment will eventually be voted into singularity . In a matter of decades , the Republican Party could cease to be a national party . '' Closing credits : Wonkbook compiled with the help of Dylan Matthews and Mike Shepard .

By Ezra Klein | May 14 , 2010 ; 7:15 AM ET Regarding the above comments about the environment , the WP recently made some news when they -LRB- among others -RRB- opted not to publish a climate-change-related op-ed by scientists . Seems you have to be an anti-science skeptic these days to get any media attention . We all know that no one will actually know this for some time so the claims from honestly both sides are ludicrous . As far as the MLR issue goes that is a serious bone of contention . If we strictly limit what goes into the MLR then what you 'll see is the abrupt stopping of services such as disease management , 24 hour hotlines served by nurses funded by insurers etc. . If people do n't want to pay for it that 's fine but then do n't complain when you get crap for it . What is neglected in the statements about Berwick is that while YES the NHS does have much less cost and somewhat better outcomes for now if the US instituted a fee schedule for all providers at NHS levels you 'd see our costs go down to theirs or lower . But then again you 'd also likely see the shortage of docs that we have not become severe . That 's why -LRB- even though I 'm for capitation -RRB- it needs to be done slowly and in a reasonable manner including additional compensation for positive outcomes . The Cleveland Clinic model should be showing the way . This secret plan then was supposed to move Baucus to action even though no one was going to know about it . Yeah that makes sense . should read `` the shortage of docs that we have NOW become severe '' Ezra gotta work on the ability to adjust our typos ! In those warm waters the oil is degraded and consumed by microbes fairly quickly ... the Gulf of Mexico survived that mess -LRB- which reached up into Texas ! -RRB- and it will recover from this one too . I grant you , any loss of wildlife and fisheries is tragic , and its great motivation for getting onto energy sources other than oil . However , for the time being we need to expect situations like this occasionally -- its the price we pay , so count ourselves as part of the blame , not just BP . Lots of cosmetic surgeons , dermatologists , etc. . If anything can make big business really PRESSURE the GOP -LRB- and Business Dog Dems -RRB- to pass cap-and-trade , this is it . If the tea baggers and you stop with the `` stop spending money '' lines , maybe we have a deal . If claims on both sides are bogus , why should only the costs less messages stop . It just plays into the insurance industry 's misinformation campaign . But scientists and environmental groups are raising sharp questions about that estimate , declaring that the leak must be far larger . They also criticize BP for refusing to use well-known scientific techniques that would give a more precise figure . The criticism escalated on Thursday , a day after the release of a video that showed a huge black plume of oil gushing from the broken well at a seemingly high rate . BP has repeatedly claimed that measuring the plume would be impossible . '' i have never seen less access to information or worse dissemination of information , than we have had on the oil spill . the last thing , janet napolitano said for the press , after being there , is that it is comforting that a lot of the spillage may be natural gas . '' would she like to tell all of us that ? who told her that ? i would like to hear from the napolitano , salazar and chu on a regular basis , about what is going on there . the best place to find information is on nola.com ... information for the people in the region ... otherwise , it is just hearsay , that is told half-jokingly , about the tophat not working . are they still burning the oil ? british petroleum has apparently bought up one third of the world supply of dispersant . does the epa have any accountability to the american people to let us know if bp should be using this amount in our waters ? Sure some dermatologists focus on specialties that have nothing to do with income . Also cosmetic surgeons that deal with accidents\\/burn victims are not limited to the wealthy . Either way I do n't get your point ? Insurers do n't cover them -LRB- if they 're cosmetic -RRB- so its completely out of their pocket . What do we care then ? While i 'm on the subject -LRB- and I 'll open up a can of worms here -RRB- but I do n't believe that IVF treatment should be covered under healthcare and I 've LONG felt this way but my lovely liberal state of NJ REQUIRES IT on many market segments . What does it do ? It adds about 5-7 % to EVERYONE 's premiums . I feel horrible for you if you want to have a child and ca n't conceive but its not medically necessary so it should not be covered . Not only that but the incidence of preemies , multiple births etc also make the cost issue we have much much worse . Not to mention many of those preemies die which make our CDC statistics look worse than the rest of the world for invalid reasons -LRB- not that it really matters unless some bash us with them -RRB- and btw you were n't throwing me in with the tea baggers were you ? What 's been done to stop the rise in costs ? Some nice pilot programs ? Giving people insurance in four years -LRB- actually Medicaid -RRB- so that they use the doctors offices instead of ER 's ? As soon as the `` will bankrupt the country '' lines stop as well . If claims on both sides are bogus , why should only the costs less messages stop . It just plays into the insurance industry 's misinformation campaign . I 'd expect the insurance industry -LRB- for all the bashing they get -RRB- would sign on today for cost certainty in the form of price controls . Heck , the government would be doing their job for them . Here is a group of folks who have too much power ; with no science to back up their power . Berwick might like NHS but he also makes the argument that it could be occasionally justified , in the interest of being patient-centered , for physicians to perform unnecessary tests -LRB- one of the few areas where I disagree with Berwick , actually -RRB- . She knows this and even links to his stuff on Health Affairs that goes over that . Unnecessary services are the opposite of rationing but she 's just trying to write a catchy headline . Second , the world 's most respected scientists disagree with you . Here 's a link from the first comment above to prove it . i would like to hear from the napolitano , salazar and chu on a regular basis , about what is going on there . Sadly , I have come to the conclusion that we do n't get regular press briefings from cabinet-level officials about the Deepwater disaster , because more often than not the answer to every question would be `` We do n't know . '' It is increasingly clear that the Federal government is little more than a bystander in any oil spill , and especially so when the leak is a mile below the surface of the ocean . Officials will probably be more comfortable when the oil reaches the shoreline and the wetlands , because then there will be a clean-up operation to supervise , and the government will have something that they can do besides hold hearings . It is maddening that our government gives away our own natural resource to the oil companies , even subsidizes its taking , without first requiring a viable plan to cope with the worst case scenario in the event of the accident , and resources in place to carry out the plan immediately in concert with the government . The clueless and helpless behavior of industry and government in this situation is galling , and it is extremely disappointing that we are not getting better leadership from the White House and from the Congress to at least suspend future drilling and require better safety measures and disaster plans for the wells that are already in operation . This is certainly not `` Obama 's Katrina , '' but neither is it any kind of positive model for disaster management . jkaren is right that even if we ca n't always get the kind of definitive information we would like , it would be helpful if there was some kind of regular briefing by an official in a position to give the best information about the disaster and the strategies to stop the leak and mitigate the environmental damage . "}, {"uid": "301", "dct": "2010-05-14", "dates": ["2010-04-20", "2010-05-13", "2010-05-13"], "text": "For nearly three weeks , the world has been hearing about the leaking well on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . Now there 's video footage , and it 's not pretty , showing a turbulent plume of oil and gas billowing from the end of a 21-inch pipe that dropped to the mud floor of the gulf after the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . But the new video clips do n't clarify one of the biggest unknowns : How much oil are we looking at ? The experts say emphatically that anyone who makes an estimate of the leak by looking at the video is simply arm-waving . There are too many variables . The stuff coming out of the pipe is n't just oil , for example , but a frothing cocktail of oil , gas , brine and sediment from miles below the sea bottom . BP , however , could try to measure the flow directly with off-the-shelf instruments routinely used in research on deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold hydrocarbon seeps , according to scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution . They said devices that can essentially take a sonogram of the plume could be strapped to one of the robotic submarines that BP has deployed around the damaged well . `` You can use this type of technique to determine the velocity of the particles , and if you know what the area is , it 's relatively straightforward mathematics to determine what the volume is , '' said Andy Bowen , director of the National Deep Submergence Facility at Woods Hole . BP representatives have spoken extensively with Woods Hole scientists about using scientific instruments to measure the flow . But a BP spokesman , David Nicholas , said the company has decided to focus on stopping the leak rather than measuring it . `` I do n't think an estimate of the flow rate would change either the direction or the scale of our response to it , '' Nicholas said . That response includes a new option that BP detailed Thursday . Engineers want to thread a second pipe into the end of the pipe that is spewing oil and gas , very much like inserting one drinking straw into the end of another . Ideally the `` riser insertion , '' as the option is called , would divert the oil to a barge on the surface rather than let it pollute the gulf . BP is also finishing the plumbing on a small dome , nicknamed the `` top hat , '' that could be lowered onto the leak to capture the oil and pipe it to the surface . Other options remain in the mix , none of which have ever been attempted before on a blown-out well in such deep water . `` None of these things are certain . They 're the next practical options that have come down our conveyor belt , '' Nicholas said . As the oil slick remains largely offshore , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to dredge the Mississippi River to gather sediment for creating an emergency archipelago of barrier islands . On Thursday evening , the Army Corps of Engineers closed a 24-hour comment period in which federal agencies could voice any objections to the massive barrier island restoration plan . The slick on the surface of the gulf is a moving target for scientists trying to estimate the rate of oil leaking nearly a mile below . It has changed sizes in heavy seas . The oil manifests itself in a variety of forms , which are documented in government reports as silver sheen , transparent sheen , brown oil , tarballs and `` orange pancakes or streamers .

What the Obama administration did not realize was how the arcane world of offshore drilling would collide with official Washington as politicians began kibitzing about rig mechanisms on Sunday talk shows and oil executives gave daily briefings about their disaster-management skills . The administration probably had no idea that it would find itself in many ways dependent on a foreign oil company -- both foe and needed friend in the response . It was a relationship for which neither the White House nor BP was well prepared . And it stands in contrast to the arm 's - length distance that the U.S. government kept from Exxon after the Valdez spill in 1989 . Thomas A.

From the beginning , the oil giant has highlighted the collaborative nature of its relationship with the administration . `` BP is hugely appreciative of the cooperation and of what we 're receiving at all levels of government , from the very top of the administration down through the unified command and state and local governments , '' spokesman Andrew Gowers said . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , meanwhile , has tried to distance the administration from BP , saying , `` I would n't characterize them as our partner . I would characterize them as the responsible party , '' adding that the company 's role provides a clear mandate : `` They 've got to kill this well , clean up the ocean and pay the claims . '' And as even the first part of this three-pronged mission has eluded the company 's grasp , the administration has publicly lambasted BP . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said , `` Our job is basically to keep the boot on the neck of British Petroleum . '' From the start , the federal government pushed BP to act quickly : The oil giant planned to bring in remote-operated vehicles a few days after the explosion to see what was happening underwater , and Interior Deputy Secretary David Hayes insisted that BP bring them immediately . BP also proposed setting up the unified command center in Houston , a decision Coast Guard and Interior officials overruled , saying the center should be closer to the work site , in Robert , La. . When it comes to stanching the flow of oil , however , the administration has often been reduced to the role of questioner . On the evening of April 27 , Salazar spent two hours grilling BP chief executive Tony Hayward and BP America President Lamar McKay on details about the blowout preventer , apparently exhausting their knowledge of the device . `` You 've got to talk more to our technical experts , because you 're asking questions I ca n't answer , '' Hayward said . Now the government has embedded senior administration scientists at BP 's headquarters in Houston , including the heads of three national labs and the director of the U.S. Geological Survey . The government is relying on BP 's expertise and its equipment : Salazar joined Napolitano in calling the Pentagon to ask whether it had better submersible equipment to augment or replace the vehicles that BP had deployed . The answer , according to an administration official , was that the military did not have anything that could operate on the seabed and match the BP equipment 's level of precision . At times BP has pushed back on the administration 's demands , including when the Navy proposed bringing in an amphibious vessel at the company 's expense . One company official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said BP had urged the government to develop `` a realistic shopping list .

'' An independent firm hired by BP wrote in an April letter that it had substantiated allegations by a former contractor that the petroleum company was violating its own policies on the Atlantis , which is stationed more than 150 miles from New Orleans in 7,070 feet of water . Billie Pirner Garde , a deputy ombudsman , wrote to contractor Kenneth Abbott and stated that multiple workers on the Atlantis had raised similar safety concerns . `` The concerns that you expressed regarding the status of the drawings upgrade project were not unique to you , '' Garde wrote . `` It was a challenge to the Project and of concern to others who raised the concern before you worked there , while you were there and after you left . '' In February , two months before an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon , more than a dozen members of Congress called on the Minerals Management Service , the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling , to investigate Abbott 's complaints . An agency probe is ongoing . An attorney for BP wrote a letter to Congress in January saying the company was compliant with all federal requirements and the Atlantis has been operating so safely that it received an MMS award , the Associated Press reported . According to one document unearthed in the course of a dispute between Abbott and the oil company , BP production member Barry C. Duff wrote in an August 2008 e-mail that `` hundreds if not thousands '' of engineering documents were incomplete , and suggested these insufficient safety records `` could lead to catastrophic operator errors . '' The documents were first reported by the Associated Press on Saturday afternoon . David Perry , a lawyer who has represented Abbott in his efforts to shut down the Atlantis , said his client was stunned to discover the rig had `` incomplete , if not inaccurate engineering documents '' when he started working for the company in September 2008 , roughly a year after the operation began . Abbott helped oversee BP 's safety compliance and the database that contained the necessary safety records as part of the project 's management team . `` All of the documents should have been completed before they started production , '' Perry said in an interview . `` He walked in the door and there was a problem . '' Abbott , he said , `` feels like his efforts to fix the problem got him terminated . '' In the letter to Abbott , Garde dismissed the idea that he had been retaliated against . She also wrote that the `` Project Execution Plan '' BP had violated was `` a BP internal document , not a regulatory requirement . '' Abbott and his lawyers have appealed repeatedly to senior Interior Department officials to shut down operations on the rig . `` The only way to protect the Gulf of Mexico marine environment from this potential for catastrophe is to halt production from this platform until the massive safety failures related to Project Atlantis are rectified , '' Perry wrote in May 2009 to an attorney-adviser in the mineral resources division in Interior 's solicitor general 's office . Late Saturday , BP spokesman Andrew Gowers said the company had taken Abbott 's allegations seriously and investigated them thoroughly . `` It is my understanding that our investigation found that the operators on the platform had full access to the accurate , up-to-date drawings -LRB- topsides , hull and subsea -RRB- necessary to operate the platform safely , '' he wrote . `` I also understand that there was an issue around whether the electronic filing of those drawings was consistent with the project execution plan , but the key fact is that the operators on the platform had access to the drawings they needed for safe operation .

The `` riser insertion '' tactic , which gained support from BP engineers only in recent days , is akin to inserting one straw into another straw . The goal is to contain the oil in the main riser pipe before it reaches open water , where natural gas quickly combines with the water to form slushy methane hydrates that have complicated previous attempts to contain the leak .

The four-inch wide new pipe was inserted into the broken section known as the riser , from which the majority of the oil has been leaking . If it works , the inserted pipe could keep a substantial amount of the oil out of the sea by siphoning it up a mile-long pipe to the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and then to nearby barges . `` So far it 's working extremely well , '' said BP senior vice president for exploration and production Kent Wells . He said the company has been able to flare , or burn , some of the natural gas at the surface , an indication that the insertion pipe is working . He said it would not be clear how much of the oil can be captured for another day or two , but he called it `` a positive step forward . '' `` As of now there are still reasonably substantial amounts of oil coming out '' of the damaged pipeline into the ocean , said Andrew Gowers , an executive vice president at BP . `` That is in part a factor of the pressure we are bringing to bear in producing the oil . '' He added that the amount of oil brought up the new line would `` be steadily increased . '' He cautioned `` this is a gradual , carefully calibrated process aimed at steadily reducing the leak rather than a magic bullet . '' It also remained unclear how the effort to capture oil from the main leak would affect a smaller leak closer to the well . The company 's efforts to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico come as the existing slick has begun to touch shorelines and come closer to currents that could carry plumes of oil suspended beneath the surface out of the Gulf to areas much further away , including the Florida Keys . Late Saturday night , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a 72-hour forecast that warned , `` As the winds weaken , ocean models indicate the southern edge of the plume could begin moving more to the SW and potentially into the Loop Current . '' BP said that while it tries to siphon oil up its new insertion pipe , it was also making preparations to `` kill '' the damaged well at the sea surface by pumping drilling mud at higher pressure and weight than the oil . The mud would be pumped at more than 30,000 horsepower engine through three-inch hoses and through `` choke '' valves at the bottom of the blowout preventer near the sea floor . He said the valves could shoot up to 40 barrels a minute of mud into the well . `` We 'll be able to pump much faster than the well can flow , '' he said . `` It 's about us outrunning the well . '' Wells said the company had brought 50,000 barrels of the mud , a mixture of clay and other substances , for the effort , which he said should be far more than needed . He said that the much ridiculed `` junk shot , '' in which golf balls and shredded tires would be fired into the blowout preventer , would only be used if the drilling mud were being forced upward and needed to be blocked . Wells said it would be another week to 10 days before preparations for what the company has called the `` top kill '' effort would be complete . In the meantime , BP pressed ahead with its insertion pipe , which has been compared to inserting a straw into another straw . BP 's pipe is somewhat more sophisticated than a straw ; it has rubber components to seal off the pipe as much as possible from sea water while letting oil and gas push their way in to the new pipe . BP is also pumping 120 degree water and methanol into the long pipe in an effort to prevent the formation of crystals of gas hydrates . Those hydrates -- combinations of natural gas and sea water at high pressures and low temperatures -- form slush-like crystals that can block pipelines or even lift heavy objects off the sea floor . They were one reason for the failure of an earlier effort to lower a 98-ton steel coffer dam over the main leak site . Once the oil , gas and water mixture reaches ships on the surface , it will be processed and separated into different components . Gas is already being flared , and the oil will be loaded onto barges or tankers . Sunday 's insertion was BP 's second effort . Late Saturday night after the new tube was inserted , it was yanked out after the umbilical cord of a remotely-operated vehicle got entangled with the tube 's line to the surface , according to sources familiar with the project .

In the first of at least 88 suits filed since the disaster , they were seeking compensation for the widow of a Transocean worker who went missing and is presumed dead . It marked the beginning of legal action that is spreading as inexorably as the oil that threatens the wildlife and economy of five states along the Gulf of Mexico . `` On Thursday , I could smell the oil and , being a toxic tort lawyer , I realized that the fact that you 're smelling something means that you 're inhaling something , '' Stuart Smith , a New Orleans lawyer , said this month when breezes were carrying the scent of the oil slick toward the city . Smith , who has sued major oil companies before , immediately contacted toxicologists and air monitors to start doing tests that could be used as evidence . The law firms now assembling are members of the all-star team of plaintiffs ' attorneys . They have experience suing big companies over asbestos , tobacco , oil company waste , breast implants and Chinese drywall . They have represented Ecuadoran shrimp farmers and New York lobstermen , patients who have swallowed Vioxx and investors who lost money on shares of Enron . And their ranks include the likes of Erin Brockovich , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former partners of Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. `` When we put together the team for tobacco ... it was the A-team of lawyers , and this is the same thing developing here , '' said Mike Papantonio , who cut his teeth on asbestos litigation and is a partner in Florida-based Levin , Papantonio , Thomas , Mitchell , Echsner & Proctor . The firm says it has won $ 2.5 billion in jury verdicts , including a dozen of more than $ 10 million each . The prospects of getting big dollars in this case are good , too , lawyers say . They are eyeing BP , one of the five biggest publicly owned companies in the world ; Transocean , the largest offshore driller in the world ; Halliburton , the big oil services firm ; and Cameron , maker of the well 's failed blowout preventer . Anadarko Petroleum and Mitsui , BP 's partners in the offshore lease , also are liable . Unlike the Exxon Valdez tanker accident , which happened in Alaska 's remote Prince William Sound , the current spill could have a much bigger economic impact because the Gulf of Mexico is a busy home to valuable fisheries , tourism and shipping . Smith , suing on behalf of fishermen , the Louisiana Environmental Action Network and four large hotels , alleges that BP and others were `` grossly negligent '' in allowing the blowout to occur . Damage includes removal costs , property damage and the loss of income and profits for people and businesses . Because the spill has been lingering offshore , the plaintiffs who can claim damages so far are mostly out-of-work fishermen and tourist resorts that are getting cancellations . As rich as BP is , `` if this well keeps leaking for three or four months , it 's Katie bar the door , '' Smith said . `` I do n't think they have enough money . '' He said fishing beds might need one or two generations to recover . Some lawyers say the case also offers a chance to take on the oil industry 's political ties . Papantonio wants to depose the person who ran the Minerals Management Service under President George W. Bush to find out why the agency did not require certain types of safety devices . `` I want to talk about the mindset of this company , because that becomes probative for a company that was so reckless that it becomes manslaughter , and that affects whether there should be punitive damages , '' Papantonio said .

It will be announced `` in the coming days , '' according to the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . The news came as the Interior Department 's top official overseeing offshore oil and gas drilling announced that he will step down May 31 and as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar unveiled reforms intended to change the way the department conducts onshore oil and gas drilling . Several lawmakers , including Rep. Lois Capps -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse -LRB- D-R.I. -RRB- , had been pushing for an independent commission and had introduced legislation to pressure the White House . Lawmakers also questioned the Minerals Management Service 's oversight of oil and gas drilling , and the Interior Department was sued in two separate courts on the issue . In a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing Monday , Chairman Joseph I. Lieberman -LRB- I-Conn . -RRB- questioned the agency 's policies toward oil companies and BP 's lack of readiness for a major oil spill . `` I continue to hold the federal government responsible for continuing to issue permits for deepwater drilling without demanding that the companies engaged in that drilling be better prepared for an accident , an explosion , '' Lieberman said . He said that although he supports expanding domestic energy production , `` until those questions are answered satisfactorily , I do n't see how our government can allow any new deep-water wells to be permitted and drilled ... The U.S. government has a responsibility to the public safety that is more important , and that responsibility , I fear , was not fulfilled in this case . '' Two environmental groups , Defenders of Wildlife and the Southern Environmental Law Center , filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama to try to bar the MMS from continuing to exempt new exploratory drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico from the sort of detailed analysis required under the National Environmental Policy Act . The groups cited documents showing that the MMS provided `` categorical exclusions '' to more than 20 new structures and exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon explosion . `` It 's unconscionable that after the Deepwater Horizon blew and began spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico , MMS continues to approve new drilling at even deeper depths without environmental review , '' said Catherine Wannamaker , a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center . `` Through our lawsuit today , we 're seeking an immediate halt to new exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico proceeding without environmental review . '' Salazar said that with the reforms being put into place , exclusions from an environmental review will be issued only under `` extraordinary circumstances . '' In a separate move , former BP contractor Kenneth Abbott and his attorneys filed an injunction in federal court in Houston to try to force Interior to shut down BP 's Atlantis rig , which he said has lacked hundreds of complete engineering documents since it started operation in 2007 . BP denied the allegation . Interior officials said they did not encourage Chris Oynes -- whose served in the government for 35 years -- to retire , even though he has come under fire from former MMS officials for being too close to the industry officials he regulates . `` This was Chris Oynes ' decision to retire after almost 35 years of public service , '' an Interior official said in an e-mail . The official asked not to be identified , citing the sensitivity of a personnel matter . `` Shortly after the Deepwater Horizon explosion , he approached leadership at MMS and announced he would be retiring on June 30th , and today he told his colleagues that he would be accelerating his retirement .

Coast Guard Via Associated Press -RRB- OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO -- Strapped into a National Guard Black Hawk , peering down at green water mottled with oil sheen , the most serious man in Louisiana is starting to sound ridiculous . Over the helicopter 's intercom , Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- is explaining to the mayor of New Orleans two of the state 's efforts to keep back the oil slick . One is named for a Mexicanentree . The other is named for a Cajun sausage . The `` burrito levee '' and the `` boudin bag '' are part of a vast effort , overseen by Jindal , to hold back a slick that is already spitting tar balls onto the state 's coast . He also has a plan to create more Louisiana , building new barrier islands in the oil 's path . `` It makes so much sense . It 's so obvious . We gotta do it , '' Jindal said into his headphones . His call for a major government response stands in apparent contrast to his previous calls for small government . Indeed , in a crisis marked by desperate improvisation -- where the search for solutions has turned to golf balls and top hats -- nobody is matching Jindal 's frenetic vigor . Local observers say the oil spill is testing the promise that almost three years ago made this son of Indian immigrants governor : that he could keep his catastrophe-scarred state safe , through good data and hard work . `` He 's there because of Katrina , he 's there because of the failed response to a disaster , and I think he recognizes that , '' said Kirby Goidel , a political science professor at Louisiana State University . `` He absolutely has sort of over-learned that mistake . '' On Monday , Jindal said his state would not slow its response , despite the news that the oil company BP was siphoning about 1,000 barrels of oil a day out of a pipe that began leaking around April 22 -- a fraction of the total spill . `` We are nowhere close to the finish line , '' Jindal said in a statement . He noted that oil has already been found along 29 miles of the state 's coast : `` Oil continues to pour into the gulf and hit our shores . '' Jindal , 38 , was elected governor in 2008 , his political rise starting when he was appointed at age 24 to head the state 's Department of Health and Hospitals . He still struggles with political aesthetics : In the first days after the crisis , Jindal showed up wearing a blue blazer at a news conference in a broiling marsh . Only recently has he donned the standard governor-in-crisis uniform of rolled-up shirt sleeves . And Jindal was widely thought to have blown his first real test as a national politician . Last year , he was chosen to give the Republican response to President Obama 's first address to a joint session of Congress . But his speech -- urging smaller government and criticizing money for monitoring another source of natural disasters , volcanoes -- was criticized as flat and over-familiar . But now , Jindal 's skills seem as right for this moment as they were wrong for that one . `` Bobby Jindal is a first-class , straight-A warrior , '' said Chris Moran , who owns a marina , a restaurant and a charter-fishing business in the oil-field hub of Port Fourchon , La. . He said he liked that Jindal had visited his area -LRB- although Moran wished the governor had stayed for a steak -RRB- and admired his efforts to have National Guardsmen use huge sandbags to plug holes that bring gulf water to inland marshes . `` He 's probably the most-suited governor for a natural disaster .

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told Senate committees Tuesday that the company would attempt a `` dynamic kill '' of the oil well Saturday . That procedure involves pumping thick mud into the well in hopes of blocking the oil . And hundreds of miles from the Louisiana coast , there was a worrisome discovery : Tar balls , sticky clumps of decayed oil , were found Monday in Key West , Fla. . Officials said they were being tested to determine whether they came from the leaking BP well . But the most ominous news came from south Louisiana , where the Mississippi Delta peters out into the Gulf of Mexico . There , instead of the tar balls that had previously washed ashore from the spill , thick , brown oil was infiltrating the edges of the marshes . `` If I had been standing up , I would have fell to my knees , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , La. , about the moment that he heard the news . Nungesser , whose parish follows the Mississippi out to sea , said the oil had been spotted at places called South Pass and Pass-a-Loutre . `` It 's our greatest fear . '' If these marshes are destroyed by oil , it could mean huge losses for the area 's seafood industry and a reduction in Louisiana 's already skimpy shield against a hurricane storm surge . `` We 're finished . We 're out of business '' if that happens , Nungesser said . This news was not a huge surprise : For days , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted that thick oil might make landfall near here . These marshes are the closest land to the spot where the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig sank April 22 . But Louisiana officials said the oil 's arrival underscored the need for their radical-sounding solution : the construction of a chain of small offshore islands to block the oil from the coast . `` This is the first time we 've seen this much heavy oil this far into our wetlands , '' Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- said at a news conference here in Venice , the last town before the coastal marshes begin . `` We know there 's a lot more heavy oil behind it that has n't made it to shore yet . '' Also Tuesday , BP said it was slowly increasing the amount of oil it was siphoning away from the leaking well , using a tube inserted into a broken-off pipe Sunday . BP said it was removing 2,000 barrels of oil a day from the leak , up from 1,000 . It 's not clear how much of the spilling oil that represents : Officials had first estimated the leak at 5,000 barrels a day , but outside experts have said it appears much larger than that . Video of the leak , released by U.S. Sens. Bill Nelson -LRB- D-Fla . -RRB- and Barbara Boxer -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- , showed oil continuing to billow out of the leaking pipe , even with the siphon pipe inserted into it . The company 's plan to stop the leak involves pumping heavy `` kill mud '' at 40 barrels a minute into openings in the blowout preventer , a mechanism that surrounds the drill pipe . If the influx of mud does not clog the drill pipe , a BP spokesman said , the company could still use a `` junk shot '' later -- pumping larger debris such as golf balls and pieces of tire into the mechanism . Mark Proegler , a BP spokesman , said the company had not used the mud-pumping technique earlier because it had to first gather data about pressures inside the blowout preventer . `` It takes a while to gather the information we need , '' he said . So far , officials said , the oil has not caused catastrophic damage on shore : Just 23 `` oiled '' birds have been found dead , in contrast to the tens of thousands killed by the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 . But scientists are worried about vast areas of oil floating underwater , unseen . That worry was heightened by Monday 's discovery in Key West . If the tar balls found there are determined to have come from the BP leak , that could mean some oil has made its way into the Inner Loop currents of the Gulf Stream . NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said that oil swept up in the current might take eight to 10 days to reach the Florida Keys . Exxon Mobil , meanwhile , said it had delayed plans to start drilling an exploration well this week in the Gulf of Mexico . Fahrenthold reported from Washington .

Thursday , May 20 , 2010 ; 4:41 PM BP said Thursday that it is now capturing 5,000 barrels a day of crude oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas from a leaking pipe at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , the first official admission that earlier estimates of the amount of oil spilling into sea were too small . The amount of oil being captured is only a portion of the total because the company is catching oil from only one of two leaks . BP has also released a video that shows additional unquantified amounts of oil continuing to spurt out of the damaged pipe where the company is capturing oil through a new tube insertion . The smaller of the two leaks continues to spill unobstructed and accounts for 15 percent of the total flow , BP officials reiterated Thursday . Separately , the Environmental Protection Agency informed BP officials late Wednesday that the company has 24 hours to choose a less toxic form of chemical dispersants to break up the oil spill and must apply the new form of dispersants within 72 hours of submitting the list of alternatives . The move is significant , because it suggests federal officials are now concerned that the unprecedented use of chemical dispersants could pose a significant threat to the Gulf of Mexico 's marine life . BP has been using two forms of dispersants , Corexit 9500A and Corexit 9527A , and so far has applied 600,000 gallons on the surface and 55,000 underwater . On Thursday BP ordered 60,000 gallons of Dispersit -- a less-toxic dispersant preferred by many environmentalists and lawmakers -- according to Rep. Jerrold Nadler -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- . Estimates of the amount of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico have varied widely . BP originally estimated that 1,000 barrels a day were leaking into the sea , but days later the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration upped the estimate to 5,000 barrels a day based on measurements of the surface area and thickness of the spill , which was estimated in microns or millimeters in many places . Some reputable private experts have said that the actual figure could be five times the NOAA figure . `` It was always made clear that this was a ballpark estimate , '' said Andrew Gowers , head of BP group media . BP says that the actual figure would n't change their response , which is to do as much as they can to stop the leak , keep the spill offshore and clean up areas where oil lands . But some environmentalists say that knowing the actual amount would help determine strategies for cleanup . Meanwhile , the EPA 's order to change dispersants posed a new challenge for BP , which has been applying the chemicals both at the surface and at the sea floor near the damaged pipe . `` Dispersants have never been used in this volume before , '' said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity before the decision was formally announced . `` This is a large amount of dispersants being used , larger amounts than have ever been used , on a pipe that continues to leak oil and that BP is still trying to cap . '' The new policy applies to both surface and undersea applications , according to sources , and comes as the EPA has just posted BP 's own results from monitoring the effect that underwater application of chemical dispersants has had in terms of toxicity , dissolved oxygen and effectiveness .

Thursday , May 20 , 2010 ; 10:13 AM The Environmental Protection Agency informed BP officials late Wednesday that the company has 24 hours to choose a less toxic form of chemical dispersants to break up its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , according to government sources familiar with the decision , and must apply the new form of dispersants within 72 hours of submitting the list of alternatives .

On Monday , Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- sent a letter to EPA administrator Lisa P. Jackson questioning the approach , given that Britain banned more than a decade ago some formulations of the dispersant , Corexit , that is now being used .

In a conference call with reporters Friday morning , officials from several federal agencies listed the animals injured so far . Forty-three birds have been found dead from oil in the gulf , and 23 found `` oiled '' but alive . That number is up slightly from a few days ago . Authorities have also found 186 sea turtles , most of them dead . But , in all but three of those cases , the turtles showed no external signs of oil . They have also found 18 stranded dolphins but have no proof that the oil slick is to blame in those cases , either . In the call , officials said that many more wildlife probably have been killed by the oil , but their toll is hidden because their bodies have sunk in the open ocean , or been eaten by scavengers . `` We expect the numbers of affected wildlife to increase , '' said Ralph Morgenweck of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . `` Many of the wildlife ... that die from this spill will never be recovered . '' So far , this spill 's impact on wildlife seems tiny in comparison to the 1989 spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska . There , scientists estimated the oil killed 250,000 seabirds , in addition to bald eagles , sea otters , killer whales and other creatures . But now , scientists have cautioned that , because so much of the oil in the gulf is hidden deep underwater , they know very little about where it is , or where it might be harming wildlife . `` We 've never really seen this kind of thing , '' said Roger Helm , also of the Fish and Wildlife Service . `` This one 's coming in a way that has a lot of us working to understand , what is going to be the longer-term impact ? ... How do we get our brain around this ? The impact on wildlife on shore might increase soon , now that thick sludge has begun washing up in marshes and on beaches in remote areas of south Louisiana . The Times-Picayune newspaper in New Orleans reported Friday that on Elmers Island , La. , `` Hundreds of oil-coated hermit crabs lay dead or dying along the blackened shoreline , having lost their battle to crawl out of the toxic mess . '' On Thursday afternoon , marine scientist Nancy Rabalais got an up-close look at the oil when she scuba dived into waters about 10 miles off the Louisiana coast . She was going in to change out a series of meters , attached to the legs of an oil platform , that measure underwater oxygen content . When she and her team dived in , Rabalais said , there was no oil in the area . But , after a few minutes , blobs and thick , eight-foot-long patches of it began floating in . When they arrived at the surface , the boat crew yelled at them to get out of the water quickly . `` You all gotta get out of here , right now ! '' Rabalais recalled him saying . `` It was at the surface when we came back up . '' Rabalais said the stuff was strong-smelling and sticky , and clung to the divers and their equipment . `` They say I have a glob of it in my hair , '' she said by cellphone , a few minutes after leaving the boat . `` I 've got to go out and get a bottle of Dawn ... and de-oil myself . '' Rabalais said the experience had given her an appreciation for what it must be like for animals that swim in the gulf , especially animals such as turtles and dolphins that must come to its oily surface to breathe . `` I , as someone who was totally covered up and breathing my own air -LRB- from a tank -RRB- , would not go back in it , '' she said .

See the vibrant ecosystem that thrives on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . One month after the start of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , federal officials said Thursday that oil was gushing out of the ground faster than they had estimated -- and that it would be days before they had a firm handle on the rate . Officials initially put the flow at 5,000 barrels a day . But on Thursday , the oil company BP announced that it was collecting that amount through a tube inserted into a leaking pipe , and video from the seafloor showed oil still spewing from the pipe . BP said oil was also leaking from a spot a few yards away . `` Now , it 's time to get better information , '' said Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , who is leading the federal response to the spill resulting from the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . Allen said it might be several days before scientists come up with a new estimate . The government did not want to issue a new estimate and then have to revise it again , he said . Allen repeated what Obama administration officials have said for days : that the size of the leak would not affect their cleanup efforts , which are geared to combat `` the worst-case scenario . '' Also Thursday , the heads of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Homeland Security told BP chief executive Tony Hayward in a letter that the company had `` fallen short '' of its promises to keep the public and the federal government informed about the spill . `` BP must make publicly available any data and other information related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that you have collected , '' EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano wrote . They asked for the results of tests looking for traces of oil and dispersant chemicals in the waters of the gulf . BP did not respond Thursday to requests for comment about the letter . Separately , the EPA told BP officials Wednesday that the company had 24 hours to choose a less toxic form of chemical dispersant to break up the oil spill and must apply the new form of dispersant within 72 hours of submitting the list of options . The move suggests that federal officials are concerned that the unprecedented use of dispersants could pose a significant threat to the Gulf of Mexico 's marine life .

Obama tapped Allen last month to be national incident commander when he labeled the spill an `` incident of national significance . '' Such incidents -- usually a natural disaster or terrorist attack -- require the president to appoint a federal official to coordinate the government 's response . Allen is set to be relieved of his other duties by Adm. Robert J. Papp Jr. by the end of May , but Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Thursday that he will continue to serve as national incident commander . Allen said in a statement that the changes will allow him to `` focus solely on this critical response , and Admiral Papp on the vital work of the Coast Guard . '' The Coast Guard deployed rescue vessels and helicopters immediately after a mobile offshore drilling rig exploded and caught fire on April 20 , causing the spill . But federal authorities have since questioned whether the country 's chief marine safety regulator has used all its powers to ensure that such vessels are seaworthy and prepared to handle fires . More than 10,000 BP oil company employees ; local , state and federal officials ; and volunteers have responded to the spill .

President Obama will appoint former Florida senator Bob Graham -LRB- D -RRB- and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William K. Reilly to head an independent probe of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , sources familiar with the decision said Friday night . The commission , which Obama will outline Saturday during his weekly radio address , will examine issues from causes of last month 's spill -- started when an offshore drilling rig exploded April 20 and then sank -- to federal oversight of offshore oil and gas drilling and the potential risks of such energy exploration . Both men are known for their strong environmental credentials . Reilly headed the EPA under President George H.W. Bush and now serves as chairman emeritus of the World Wildlife Fund , while Graham pushed for restoration of Florida 's Everglades during his three terms in the Senate . The commission , modeled on ones which investigated the Challenger shuttle explosion and the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island , will not include any federal officials , administration officials said this week . News of the appointments came late in a day when a senior official of the BP oil company said that it was siphoning far less oil from the Gulf of Mexico than other officials had said a day earlier , while Louisiana officials gave voice to rising frustration over the pace of the cleanup operation . Doug Suttles , the oil company 's chief operating officer , said that a tube inserted into a leaking pipe on the sea floor had captured 2,200 barrels of oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas in 24 hours . BP said Thursday that it was collecting 5,000 barrels a day , but Suttles said that rate was achieved only for short periods of time . He added that surges of gas meant that the mile-long tube , which is connected to a ship , was at times bringing up no oil . `` We 've never said it produced 5,000 barrels a day ... I apologize if for some reason you 've heard it that way , '' Suttles said . `` Yes , at some points in time , we 've had rates as high as 5,000 , but the average in the last day was 2,200 . '' At a command center in Robert , La. , Suttles said that the next effort to stop the oil spill -- a `` dynamic kill , '' in which high-pressure mud is used to plug the hole in the sea floor -- was not likely to come until Tuesday . Work to disperse and burn the oil offshore was making `` good progress , '' Suttles said . Closer to the coast , he said , `` Our near-shore activities were also quite successful yesterday ... We 're quite fortunate ; we have only had oil show up on seven locations onshore . '' But the mood was bleaker close to the coast . At a news conference in Chauvin , La. , Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- noted that thick , sludgy oil was now broaching some of his state 's marshes and beaches , and said he was beginning an emergency effort to build large sand islands to protect inland marshes . `` We 're not going to wait any longer . We can not wait any longer , '' Jindal said . The U.S. government has not yet responded to a Louisiana plan to build a larger string of barrier islands along the state 's coast . U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Edwin M. Stanton -- who oversees the New Orleans area -- admitted in Chauvin that he had not pushed BP hard enough , and that the oil company had moved too slowly in bringing floating `` containment boom '' to areas threatened by oil .

The agreement was the subject of a letter , obtained by The Washington Post , written by rig owner Transocean and signed by a BP representative . BP told members of Congress this month that it did not know about a reconfiguration of the blowout preventer . Rep. Bart Stupak -LRB- D-Mich . -RRB- , after reviewing information provided by BP , called the test valve `` useless '' and questioned Transocean about its placement . He said BP told his subcommittee that while oil was spilling into the Gulf of Mexico the company spent `` an entire day 's worth of precious time ... engaging rams that closed the wrong way '' because a test valve was in the place where BP expected to find a variable bore ram capable of pinching off the oil flow . BP and Transocean have said there were still more than the number of rams required by the Minerals Management Service . Rams are devices designed to cut off surging oil and natural gas after a well blowout like the one that set the Deepwater Horizon on fire on April 20 and started the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . But given the failure of the blowout preventer to stop the explosion and oil spill , investigators are looking closely at every aspect of the operation . It remains unclear what caused , and what might have stopped , the spill . In the letter , dated Oct. 11 , 2004 , Transocean senior marketing executive Christopher S. Young wrote to document an agreement with BP that Transocean would convert a variable bore ram with a test ram at BP 's expense . He said that by signing the letter , BP would be acknowledging that the conversion `` will reduce the built-in redundancy '' of the blowout preventer , `` thereby potentially increasing Contractor 's risk profile . '' A BP representative signed the letter on Oct. 19 , 2004 . A company spokesman said Saturday that Transocean was responsible for any modifications . A variable bore ram can clamp down and seal openings around pipes of different sizes . It is one of a series of rams on a blowout preventer designed to stop the flow of oil and gas if a driller loses control of the pressure in a well . After installing the test valve , two variable bore rams still remained on the blowout preventer . Some companies have advocated the permanent installation of test valves on the blowout preventer to save time and money during testing . When the issue came up during the May 12 hearing of the House subcommittee on oversight and investigations , Transocean chief executive Steven Newman said modifications to the blowout preventer were done in 2005 at BP 's request and expense . BP America President Lamar McKay then said , `` I do n't personally know whether those were the exact modifications '' that BP discovered after the accident `` or -LRB- whether -RRB- there were additional ones . And I think that 's a very , very important piece of the investigation .

In the days after the immensity of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico became clear , some Nature Conservancy supporters took to the organization 's Web site to vent their anger . `` The first thing I did was sell my shares in BP , not wanting anything to do with a company that is so careless , '' wrote one . Another added : `` I would like to force all the BP executives , the secretaries and the shareholders out to the shore to mop up oil and wash the birds . '' Reagan De Leon of Hawaii called for a boycott of `` everything BP has their hands in . '' What De Leon did n't know was that the Nature Conservancy lists BP as one of its business partners . The Conservancy also has given BP a seat on its International Leadership Council and has accepted nearly $ 10 million in cash and land contributions from BP and affiliated corporations over the years . `` Oh , wow , '' De Leon said when told of the depth of the relationship between the nonprofit group she loves and the company she hates . `` That 's kind of disturbing . '' The Conservancy , already scrambling to shield oyster beds from the spill , now faces a different problem : a potential backlash as its supporters learn that the giant oil company and the world 's largest environmental organization long ago forged a relationship that has lent BP an Earth-friendly image and helped the Conservancy pursue causes it holds dear . The crude emanating from BP 's well threatens to befoul a number of alliances between energy conglomerates and environmental nonprofits . At least one group , Conservation International , acknowledges that it is reassessing its ties to the oil company , with an eye toward protecting its reputation . `` This is going to be a real test for charities such as the Nature Conservancy , '' said Dean Zerbe , a lawyer who investigated the Conservancy 's relations with its donors when he worked for the Senate Finance Committee . `` This not only stains BP , but , if they do n't respond properly , it also stains those who have been benefiting from their money and their support . '' Some purists believe environmental groups should keep a healthy distance from certain kinds of corporations , particularly those whose core mission poses risks to the environment . They argue that the BP spill shows the downside to what they view as deals with the devil . On the other side are self-described pragmatists who , like the Conservancy , see partnering with global corporations as the best way to create large-scale change . `` Anyone serious about doing conservation in this region must engage these companies , so they are not just part of the problem but so they can be part of the effort to restore this incredible ecosystem , '' Conservancy chief executive Mark Tercek wrote on his group 's Web site after criticism from a Conservancy supporter . The Arlington County-based Conservancy has made no secret of its relationship with BP , just one of many it has forged with multinational corporations . The Conservancy 's Web site lists BP as a member of its International Leadership Council . BP has been a major contributor to a Conservancy project aimed at protecting Bolivian forests .

Federal officials say that latter plan needs more study . `` BP is the responsible party , but we need the federal government to make sure that they are held accountable and that they are indeed responsible . Our way of life depends on it , '' Jindal said at a news conference in Galliano , La. , with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar . With the realization that images of spoiled beaches and oil-covered animals are likely to become much worse in the coming weeks , the administration is torn between a political imperative -- that it take a hard line with the oil giant -- and a practical one -- that it has no choice but to rely on the company to stop the flow . Some administration officials have started taking a tougher stance with BP , with Salazar threatening on Sunday to `` push them out '' if the company did not perform . But when Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , who is directing the government 's disaster response , was asked about Salazar 's comment during a briefing Monday at the White House , he dismissed it as `` more of a metaphor . '' Allen added : `` To push BP out of the way would raise the question of : Replace them with what ? '' And BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told reporters on a conference call : `` I do n't know of anything else we could do , but if the government felt there were other things to do , it is clearly within their power to do that . '' Even in one of the few areas where the government has publicly tried to overrule BP -- over its choice of chemical dispersants -- it has not gotten its way . Last week , the Environmental Protection Agency told BP that it had 24 hours to find a less toxic alternative to the chemical it had been using to break up the oil . The company , however , replied that no alternatives are available in large enough quantities to deal with the spill . On Monday , the EPA responded that BP should keep looking . In the meantime , the agency said , it would conduct its own tests on other chemical dispersants , which was an acknowledgment that it has no answer either . Tensions are likely to grow if BP 's next effort to stop the spill -- a `` top kill , '' which involves pumping in heavy fluids and is scheduled for Wednesday -- does not succeed . That could be followed by another inventively named maneuver , a `` junk shot , '' that would clog the opening with materials that include golf balls and pieces of tire and rope . Or , more likely , BP would try to attach a new funneling device or lower a new blowout preventer on top of the 450-ton one that failed . But if those measures prove ineffective , it may be August before the leak is stopped through the completion of a relief well , Allen said .

The federal agency responsible for regulating U.S. offshore oil drilling repeatedly ignored warnings from government scientists about environmental risks in its push to approve energy exploration activities quickly , according to numerous documents and interviews . Minerals Management Service officials , who can receive cash bonuses in the thousands of dollars based in large part on meeting federal deadlines for leasing offshore oil and gas exploration , frequently changed documents and bypassed legal requirements aimed at protecting the marine environment , the documents show . This has dramatically weakened the scientific checks on offshore drilling that were established under landmark laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the National Environmental Policy Act , say those who have worked with the MMS , which is part of the Interior Department . `` It 's a war between the biologists and the engineers , '' said Thomas A. Campbell , who served as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's general counsel under President George H.W. Bush . `` They just have a very different worldview , and sometimes the engineers simply do n't listen to the biologists . '' Interviews and documents show numerous examples in which senior officials discounted scientific data and advice -- even from scientists elsewhere in the federal government -- that would have impeded oil and gas companies drilling offshore . Under the Bush and Obama administrations , red flags raised by scientists at NOAA and the Marine Mammal Commission have gone unheeded . Obama officials say they are taking steps to ensure that science guides drilling decisions ; former agency officials say such questions are rarely as simple as they seem . Several instances involving the leasing process for a section of Alaska 's Beaufort Sea and the Gulf of Mexico illustrate the problems the agency faces . In 2006 , then-MMS biologist Jeff Childs wrote a detailed analysis of how the Exxon Valdez spill had harmed generations of fish in Alaska 's Prince William Sound and how a future spill could do the same in the Beaufort Sea . But Childs 's conclusion that `` a large oil spill ... is likely to result in significant adverse effects on local -LRB- fish -RRB- populations requiring three or more generations to recover '' would have forced the MMS to conduct a full environmental impact statement before auctioning off a lease in the Beaufort Sea . `` I have concerns about Jeff 's analysis and will not insert it into the -LRB- environmental assessment -RRB- being sent to HQ at this time , '' Deborah Cranswick , chief of the environmental assessment section at the MMS , wrote in an e-mail June 23 to her Alaska colleagues . `` I believe that Regional management needs to review it first because Jeff has concluded new significant impacts from oil spills . This will trigger an -LRB- environmental impact statement -RRB- -- and thus delay the lease for at least a year . '' Six days later , Paul Stang , Alaska 's MMS regional supervisor for leasing and environment , sent a hand-written note to Childs saying , `` As you know , a conclusion of significance under -LRB- the National Environmental Policy Act -RRB- means an EIS and delay in sale 202 . That would , as you can imagine , not go over well with HQ and others . '' When Childs balked at deleting the finding , another manager rewrote it so that the lease process could move ahead without delay .

BP 's internal investigation of the Gulf Coast oil spill points to a series of equipment failures , mistakes and missed warning signs that led to the blowout and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , according to lawmakers briefed by the company . BP 's investigation , while incomplete , highlights a series of abnormal indicators -- about pipeline pressure and the flow of drilling fluids in the five hours before the explosion -- that should have been `` warning signs '' of trouble , according to a memo summarizing BP 's report . In one case , BP 's investigator told lawmakers that a `` fundamental mistake may have been made despite '' an indicator of a very large abnormality . BP also said it had concerns about the cementing job in the well , saying that one procedure had to be attempted nine times , which might have indicated `` contamination of the cement . '' In addition , lawmakers said , `` the BP investigation has also raised concerns about the maintenance history , modification , inspection , and testing of '' the blowout preventer . The account of BP 's investigation was contained in a House Energy and Commerce Committee memorandum . `` In addition , key questions exist about whether proper procedures were followed for critical activities throughout the day , '' the memorandum said . These mostly had to do with the management of drilling mud , which is used as a counterweight to oil and gas pressure pushing up from below . Once the blowout began , all the systems in place to prevent disaster broke down in serial fashion , the memorandum said , `` including the failure of its emergency disconnect system -LRB- EDS -RRB- , the failure of its automated mode function or deadman switch , the failure of the -LRB- blowout preventer 's -RRB- shearing functions , and the failure of the remote operated vehicle interventions .

The most critical moment in the oil spill crisis in the Gulf of Mexico is at hand , as BP engineers armed with 50,000 barrels of dense mud and a fleet of robotic submarines are poised to attempt a `` top kill '' maneuver to plug the gushing well a mile below the surface . It 's far from a sure bet . `` It has been done successfully in the past , but it has n't been done at this depth , '' Kent Wells , the oil company 's senior vice president of exploration and production , told reporters in a conference call Tuesday . This will be the first stab at shutting down the well since the April 20 blowout and fire that killed 11 workers on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon . Efforts to capture the spewing oil have had limited success . The expanding slick has ridden a steady sea breeze onto 70 miles of Louisiana 's shoreline and into shellfish-rich estuaries . The sight of oil-soaked brown pelicans is now common . Sticky rust-brown oil slathers the grass in the marshlands . Federal officials closed more fishing grounds Tuesday , bringing the total to more than 54,000 square miles , nearly a quarter of the federal waters in the gulf . Oil company executives will be grilled in federal hearings resuming Wednesday in a hotel in suburban New Orleans . Later this week , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is set to deliver a safety review of offshore drilling to President Obama . And then Obama will fly to the gulf on Friday for his second visit to the region since the crisis began . `` Like everybody , he 's frustrated , '' Carol Browner , assistant to the president for energy and climate change , told CNN . The developments on shore may be overshadowed by what happens in the hours and days ahead in the deep water , where the only light comes from the lamps of the robotic submarines . BP 's top-kill plan has been devised over more than a month by what BP calls a dream team of engineers from the oil industry and from such government agencies as the Energy Department , the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Geological Survey . BP has also logged 17,000 suggestions from outsiders , Wells said . Huge ships and drilling rigs now crowd the surface 5,000 feet above the blown-out well . Two rigs are drilling relief wells but are not expected to complete their work until August . Parked in the middle of everything is the command vessel for the top-kill operation , the 312-foot Helix Q4000 . Close by will be the 381-foot HOS Centerline , one of the largest supply ships in the world , capable of pumping 50 barrels of mud a minute . Two other backup ships carrying mud will be nearby . All the work at depth is performed by the remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- , numbering 12 by latest count , and operated from the surface ships while BP engineers monitor the process from Houston . The ROVs have tinkered with the five-story blowout preventer that sits atop the wellhead . They fixed a leaking hydraulic line , for example , using an ordinary wrench pinched by a robotic arm . They also removed the `` yellow pod , '' the brain of the blowout preventer , and engineers repaired it at the surface before replacing it at depth . On Tuesday , BP engineers began diagnostic tests on the blowout preventer . This is a critical phase in which the company will learn how much pressure must be overcome when the drilling mud is injected into the well . It could also lead them to abort the maneuver . `` We 've got a crack team of experts that are going to pore over the diagnostic data , '' Wells said . `` There is a remote possibility that we would get some information that it would n't work . '' If all goes as planned , a 30,000-horsepower engine aboard the HOS Centerline will pump mud at 40 to 50 barrels a minute to the Q4000 command vessel , then down a newly installed pipe to the gulf bottom , and then through flexible hoses into multiple portals in the blowout preventer . What happens next would be all-important . The mud would have to go somewhere . The hope is that so much of it would be forced into the preventer that , even as some of it surged up the riser pipe and into the water along with oil and gas , much of it would go to the bottom of the well . The well would lose all pressure and would become static . Later , BP would inject cement down the wellbore to permanently seal the well .

Obama will also travel to Louisiana on Friday , the White House said . He will get an update on the oil spill response and cleanup and will meet with residents who have been personally affected by the oil gushing from a damaged undersea well head , officials said . And he is expected to discuss the disaster Thursday , after the Interior Department reports on the circumstances that led up to the spill . Obama had ordered a review , set to arrive later this week . The show of greater attentiveness from the president comes five weeks after an April 20 explosion on a rig off the Louisiana shore killed 11 workers and triggered the oil spill . It also follows criticism from Republicans , and some Democrats , that the administration has not done enough in the crisis . Although senior administration officials have voiced growing disapproval of BP , the company operating the rig and responsible for the cleanup , the mission of the Friday trip is not to declare war on the firm , said one senior administration official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations . Instead , the official said , the trip will demonstrate that Obama is `` on top of it . '' Democrats inside and outside the White House are clamoring for more , though . Several Democratic strategists with ties to the White House said there has been concern over how long it took the administration to convey its unhappiness with BP . `` It 's not easy to craft an effective message when the disaster is ongoing , '' one Democratic adviser said . Obama 's last trip to the Gulf was last-minute , brief and had little lasting effect . He flew in and out of New Orleans on May 2 , drove two hours to a Coast Guard station and got a briefing before taking a quick helicopter tour . He did not even see the oil slick . This time , `` we are not going to have a problem finding it , '' one official said . Democratic strategist James Carville , who lives in New Orleans and has been highly critical of the administration 's actions , said he is `` glad '' Obama is coming . But he said the president has been too measured overall . `` Eleven people are killed because of multinational corporate greed , malfeasance and possibly criminal negligence ?

Despite calls to boycott the company responsible for the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill , Mora never even considered steering clear of BP 's gas . `` Of course you feel bad , but it 's not only the company 's fault , '' he said . `` It 's the government 's fault . You need to regulate these guys . '' At BP stations across the Washington region , customers say the oil spill , now in its second month , is tragic and distressing , but an accident for which they blame other businesses and the federal government as well as BP . Many motorists said they end up buying from BP purely out of convenience . Besides , they ask : Why complicate a routine fill-up with political or moral questions ? But organizers of a BP boycott -- including Public Citizen , the District-based nonprofit organization , and a Facebook group with more than 75,000 members -- say that shopping elsewhere for gas would send the oil company a powerful message . Public Citizen , founded in 1971 by consumer advocate Ralph Nader , recently launched an online BP Boycott Pledge that has collected more than 11,000 signatures from people promising to forgo all BP products for three months . A Facebook group called Boycott BP -- its insignia features a crossed-out BP logo -- urges people to avoid BP stations and affiliated companies . Kasy Tekle , assistant manager of the BP in Columbia Heights , said the gas station has not seen a decline in sales . `` We 're okay for now , '' he said . `` I do n't know much about the gas spill , but so far we 're doing okay . '' A call to a BP spokesman was not returned Monday . Trilby Lundberg , a California-based oil industry analyst , said BP boycotts are minimal and probably would not affect the company 's financial performance or retail sales . `` The general public may be aware that the spill is not a gas brand issue and that it 's an offshore oil rig problem , '' she said . Tyson Slocum , Public Citizen 's energy policy program director , acknowledged that the boycotts have hardly wounded BP 's bottom line but said the effort could help pierce the company 's eco-friendly image . Slocum suspects more would turn against BP if the spill directly affected this region . `` There are people , no matter what is going on , who will continue to prioritize convenience over taking a moral or political stand , '' Slocum said . `` The spill might be something on their minds , but it 's not in their face . '' It is too soon to tell whether the BP spill will trigger the sustained level of outrage aimed at Exxon in 1989 , when one of its tankers ran aground near the Alaskan shore , spilling 11 million gallons of crude into the Prince William Sound . A few demonstrations have been held outside BP stations in Florida , New Jersey and Ohio ; in London , Greenpeace activists scaled BP 's headquarters in protest . Washington motorists said the spill was not on their minds when they wheeled into a BP station . `` I was on ` E , ' and I knew I was n't going to make it much further -- and I want to run my air conditioner because it 's really hot , '' said Paulette Washington , an Arlington sales representative who was filling up her Honda at the BP on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington . `` It 's not like I was , like , ` Let me find a Shell . ' '' Washington did not excuse the oil company 's actions . `` I do n't think anyone should come to BP 's aid , '' she said . `` It should n't be on taxpayers . '' Emily Davies , 37 , filling up next to Washington , disagreed . `` I do think the federal government should be involved , '' she said . `` I do n't want the environment to suffer . '' Davies , who recalled trying to avoid Exxon stations after the 1989 spill , said convenience outweighed politics this time . `` I usually go to Texaco , but it was on the wrong side of the road . '' Other BP customers sympathized with the company 's predicament . `` It was an accident ; things happen , '' said Marvin Alfaro , 32 , a Woodbridge construction worker , at the BP in Columbia Heights . `` Maybe it could have been prevented . I feel bad for BP . They 're losing business . '' But some consumers were actively avoiding BP . Glenn Tolbert , an office manager , was filling up his rental car at a Hess station on Rhode Island Avenue NW after deliberately passing by the BP up the street . `` I honestly did think about '' the spill , he said . `` I watch the news . We have this spill , and it 's not stopping yet . It 's polluting the environment . It 's just my small thing to say , ' I do n't like what 's going on .

For an Obama administration spokesman on the BP oil spill , Adm. Thad Allen , the Coast Guard commandant and national incident commander , is admirably straightforward . Working on behalf of the president who ran a campaign based on the mantra , Yes We Can , Allen awkwardly insists that , in this case , no , the government can t . There are very few circumstances where the government does not have the means or national power to influence something this large , Allen said said in an interview with me at the White House on Wednesday . I think that s a source of immense frustration to everybody . Commentators increasingly lambaste the administration for not taking over the cleanup effort . In a politically calculated response , some administration officials have ratcheted up their rhetoric about keeping the federal government s boot on BP s neck ; they have now threatened to push BP out of the way , which just fuels the anger . But what many of the critics , inside and outside the administration , don t offer is much sense of what the federal government could really do better if it pushed BP aside , other than symbolic actions of questionable value , such as insisting that President Obama visit the Gulf of Mexico again and , as James Carville put it Wednesday , take control , whatever that means . -LRB- For what it s worth , the president will return to the gulf on Friday . -RRB- Under the water and on the surface , Allen says , there simply isn t much that the federal government can add to what BP is already doing , beyond providing some supplemental brain power , advanced imaging technologies and review of BP s proposals to plug the leak . Things the government has already furnished . The private sector owns nearly all the means to deal with this problem and fix the leak and stop the source . Why doesn t the Coast Guard bring in its own submersibles ? There s too much submersible traffic underwater already , he says . A couple of remote operated vehicles even got tangled inserting a tube to collect spewing oil , lengthening the operation . Why hasn t the government quickly approved a plan Louisiana officials favor to build sand berms that might protect sensitive wetlands ? Because it would take months to execute , anyway . Even so , it s undergoing requisite review at the Army Corps of Engineers . Perhaps BP is the one with the technological capabilities on and under the water . But on land , why isn t the federal government in full control of the cleanup ? It essentially is , Allen argues , since Coast Guard officials are the ones making the top-line decisions and coordinating the effort . By law , he says , BP is responsible for cleaning the mess and hires contractors created after the Exxon Valdez spill that specialize in doing just that . But the federal government is responsible for supervising and ensuring the cleanup is effective . So , according to Allen s reckoning , Americans should at least feel free to hold the administration accountable for how well the cleanup proceeds , even if it might be a tad unfair to blame Obama for BP s inability to plug the leak for more than a month . There are some problems that simply can not be fixed quickly , no matter who is in charge . But on shore , Allen points out , BP and the government have fewer restrictions on how they can react once oil is sighted . That implies more responsibility , particularly since the government is , apparently , taking such an active role . That will be little comfort to the angry Louisianans who lined up Tuesday at a town hall meeting in Plaquemines Parish to yell at officials about what they perceive as government inaction . Nor will it help the administration s press operation , which would surely prefer to have BP as an enemy rather than as a partner . But , like it or not , BP is the administration s right hand in this effort , a fact Allen has made clear for days . Indeed , part of the reason the administration 's messaging on the oil spill falls flat is that some officials attempt to play political defense by excoriating the company , even while it must admit that BP is its partner of necessity . In so doing , the Obama administration legitimizes unfocused and perhaps unfair complaints about the organization of its effort to cap and clean up the oil leak , even though , according to Allen , the White House probably couldn t do much of substance to redress many of those very criticisms . The White House is in a hard spot . The president will probably take a hit for this , fair or no , no matter what administration spokespeople say . All the more reason to be straight with Americans , as Allen seems to be , about what the government can and can t reasonably be expected to do . The truth is nobody knows whether or not the administration is not doing all it can . But like in any crisis the lack of knowledge does n't stop anyone from having a strong opinion . The smartest thing this administration has done is to STAY OUT OF THIS with regard to management ! With all due respect to the severity of this situation , even the EXPERTS in oil extraction and exploration are at odds as to what to do . Do you seriously want the government to take the reigns -LRB- and therefore the responsibility -RRB- away from areas those industries that have spend decades becoming familiar with ? We all want this thing to end , but to panic and grab the wheel away from the driver is THE WRONG thing to do . Perhaps the government should make itself available to these industries with regard to equipment and manpower , but certainly NOT direction ! Where 's the White House on that ? Oh , that 's right , a number of states on the Gulf have REPUBLICAN governors . That is too cute on the White House 's part to allow the states to beg for help . -LRB- Bobby Jindal of Louisiana is in such a spot . -RRB- Rather crude and unprofessional for this White House . We are as mad as hell ! Clean this mess up ! Interior Secretary Ken Salazar appeared May 18 , 2010 , for several Senate hearings . Many lawmakers examined the leadership of the Minerals Management Service . The Interior Department is charged with enforcing environmental and safety rules for energy exploration . Ken Salazar was working on the Cape Wind commercial wind turbine permit while the Gulf oil platform was on fire ! Soon after the platform sank into the Gulf Ken traveled to Massachusetts to announce that he had approved the Cape Wind permit ! On April 28.2010 Ken Salazar announced his decision at a joint Massachusetts State House news conference with Gov. Deval Patrick voting to go forward with the Nantucket , Massachusetts wind turbine project . The same day of this decision more than 5000 barrels of oil had poured into the Gulf of Mexico . -LRB- one barrel equals 42 gallons -RRB- . Several days later the MMS was broken into several sections ! Do we trust our government ? In retrospect should congress review the Cape Wind permit given out during the failures of MMS ? Obama , well aware that solving this takes the cooperation of the best deep water operations engineers in the world , is wise enough to listen and stay out of the way . Patton described it best : `` Tell your people what you want done and then leave it to them to do it . They will surprise and delight you with the ingenuity of their solutions . '' We have a problem because the prior planning BP should have had to do to get their drilling permit was n't done because BP declared that the chances of a spill were `` remote '' , and the Bush administration did n't question their asertion , it just let them drill . Now , after the fact and on a totally pragmatic basis BP is doing the disaster planning it should have done to get the drilling permit in the first place . It takes time to cobble up workable solutions to problems a mile below the surface , and the Gulf Coast is paying the price for BP 's avoiding paying for the engineering studies it did n't do before it ever contracted for the drilling ship . BP saved on paperwork and preplanning , and Louisiana gets to make up the savings in the ruined lives of its waterfolk . More or less SOP for republicans . This is Obama paying Whites back with a White Katrina . He 's acting very professorial and above it all as he and Rahm watch the livelihoods and dreams of mainly white fishermen and property owners go down the drain . But , they are also going to destroy the livelihoods of many minorities who rely on these middle class whites . The people who are being paid back the most though are those like James Carville : White Hypocrites . The Democratic Party is filled with White Hypocrites who have very liberal talking points but then go back to their cozy all white neighborhoods just like Ted `` 1965 Immigration Act '' Kennedy and Tip `` Anti-Irish Immigration '' O'Neill used to do . The reality is that change comes slowly , even in the face of crisis . There was no study of the environment impact of a deep water spill , there was no research into newer methods and technology for cleaning up oil spills , and there was a protocol in place to have the party responsible for the pollution be the primary responder to the spill . The government is almost completely marginalized thanks to the unregulated actions of an industry that effectively owns the regulators . What transpired 8 years ago in the energy policy meetings between Vice-President Cheney and the heads of Big Oil ? I 'm sure that no record exists and that we will never know . You have it spot on . BP and the industry has the brainpower all over the world to safely extract energy resources and should be in the lead to fix this mess . The government would have no idea what to do , even the PHD physicist Energy Secretary -LRB- big deal -RRB- . The government should protect the environment and bill BP . In fact , the winning strategy should be to let the Cajuns loose and they would protect and clean up their land . Noone wants this to happen . It 's a profound tragedy . Regrettably many people such as michealjwilson want to continue a narrative that is dilusional at best . `` Do n't blame Obama , but that damn Bush , he IS responsible ... he single handedly changed the regulations , approved permits , told BP not to worry and caused this spill '' . And that 's rational thinking ? Obama ca n't clean it up but he as a leader , can ensure that everyone works together , sets a firm but positive tone , and ensure that resources are available . Just like Bush did not personally cause this , Obama ca n't personally clean it up , but his administration needs to be held accountable under the OPA 90 Act which spells out clearly what are their responsibilities . It 's unfortunate that this spill has caused people to lose sight of the following ... 11 Americans died in the explosion and there are a lot of hard working Americans , your fellow citizens , who risk their lives daily in hazardous jobs and in remote parts of the world you would never even think existed , that provide you energy to make your life better . It 's just not gasoline !!! It 's lubricating oils and greases for turbine wind farms , fuels and greases for planes , the space shuttle , army tanks , diapers , tires , crayons etc. . Get educated about how much oil improves your life . what can the federal government do ? Our life-giving waters can not sustain more toxic burdens or spills . See the OFFICIAL MMS DOCUMENT `` Cape Wind Energy Project Final Environmental Impact Statement , Jan. 2009 US Dept. of the Interior , Minerals Management Service '' online for details of what MMS approved for the Breadbasket of Nantucket Sound . Let 's look at the US National Contingency Plan . This makes it very clear that the Responsible Party , in this case BP , will manage the operational aspects of the spill . This will be at BP 's cost . However , BP must present its response plan for approval to the Unified Command , consisting of the National On Scene Co-ordinator , a US Coast Guard Officer , -LRB- in this case Admiral Thad Allen -RRB- the EPA and the affected State -LRB- s -RRB- . So , all that BP is doing has been approved by the US Government . Although BP is in control of the approved day to day response , the US Government is in overall command . Only if the Unified Command feel that the Responsible Party is not carrying out its role properly , will it `` Federalise '' the spill , take over day to day control and thus be responsible for all the contracts and costs that this will entail . As to the cause of the spill , let 's wait until the full enquiry has determind the causes and responsibilities before making ill informed comments . Regarding the daily amount being spilled it is not helpful for so called experts to pontificate on how much , when they do not have access to the facts . As to the costs , the numbers being floated are wild speculation , with little foundation in fact . Reporters and commentators would be well advised to stick to the known facts , question more closely the veracity of the information coming from so-called `` experts '' and thus minimize the wild speculation , which only serves to exacerbate the understandable anger and frustration of the US people . At the height of the mission 's initial response to the Haitian earthquake , more than 20,000 U.S. troops , 20 ships and 130 aircraft were in Haiti to assist that country 's rebuilding and relief efforts . Mr Obama did n't need personal experience as a development engineer or relief worker to order the U.S. military to Haiti . Yet he is incapable of ordering emergency and relief efforts in the Gulf of Mexico ? Is U.S. aid for redevelopment only for Afghanistan ? Why is American `` soft power '' to be used only for the benefit of foreign nations ? Given the former vice presidents affinity for undisclosed locations , we should stuff him in the blow out preventer and not tell anyone where he is . Bring food and water ... erect temporary housing ... provide medical aid ... provide security . Whether it 's a tornado in Kansas or an earthquake in Sumatra , the basic steps are the same ... it 's usually a question of scale . In this case , the challenges are different . BP , or more generally , the oil industry , has to take the technical lead on stopping the leak . What could the feds do ? They could have requested or organized resources from the other oil companies to bring their best people in to help . But in this country , the government is not in the oil business , unlike many other countries around the world . For the containment and clean-up , I think the feds are a fairer target . You have to have a more effective plan . That is a public safety issue . But that also means more government regulation . So I hope when new regulations and requirements are put into place , we do n't hear the limited government people screaming about the feds ' intrusions on their `` rights '' . BHO makes Jimmy Carter look COMPETENT & Richard Nixon look HONEST ! just SEEING\\/HEARING him makes me GAG ! OMG , is he finding out he 's not the Second Coming after all ? What will a smattering of humility do to his overinflated ego ? I think it 's funny indeed , this mouth had so much to say about his predecessor 's ineptitude in all matters , and now it 's become absolutely clear even to the koolaid crowd that Stinky\\/BO ca n't manage his way out of a paper bag , and is a dishonest sleazebag global sycophant to boot . It 's Day 37 of the Spill . Obama still has n't declared it a national Emergency ! He still hasnt ' given Lousiana the VERY SPECIFIC help their Governor is asking for . And Obama is to blame . he 's the commander in chief . He can mobilize resources in a way no one else can . but he has n't done it . Especially in comparison to the way Bush was skewered over his handling of Katrina -- which in retrospect was really a total failure of the state and city governments to : -LRB- a -RRB- implement their disaster plans already in place and -LRB- b -RRB- fix the levees prior to katrina . Lousiana had klnown the levees were not sufficient but they squandered 10 's of millions of dollars over 2 decades earmarked to fix the levees . I am not defending the inadequacy of the Federal repsonse in those 4 days -LRB- that 's right only 4 days -RRB- following Katrina . It was a mess . But now we have Obama who has wasted 37 days !!! and counting without any coherent federal response . 37 Days !!!! and now the entire Gulf ecosystem being destroyed before our eyes . And all Obama has done is pass the buck , go to fundraisers , and blame bush . REST GRANT THEM O LORD , AND LET PERPETUAL LIGHT SHINE UPON The Commander in Chief , who is not a veteran , will not be attending services at Arlington this Memorial Day . He is otherwise engaged . In the 2 year campaign to become president , Obama bashed the Bush administration for it 's inability to manage a crises . Now that he is in charge he is learning first hand that the Federal government is largely inable to handle any crises . No matter who is the president , government has become far too large and ineffecient to be `` managed '' . Obama was either naive or lying when he blamed everything from Katrina to the financial meltdown on Bush . I contend that he was just lying . He was fully aware that government was broken . Now his chickens are coming home to roost . Let 's see if he can handle the criticism with the grace of his predecessor . I suspect we will see armies of Obama-ites on the news shows pointing fingers at others as the only crises they are trained to handle are those of political perceptions . Already you have seen leftie bloggers and radio\\/TV hosts blaming the oil spill on , who else , Bush . Because like everyone else he 's BOUGHT . Real leadership would 've seized the situation , as well as BP , and taken command of the situation rather than let our oceans be fouled and habitat destroyed . The scope of the amoral , unconscionable greed will come into full light once we ALL feel the catastrophic effects this will bring about to our planet . We wo n't have to wait long . After all , small-government libertarians and republicans want the government out of our lives , eh ? Why should my taxes go to clean up THEIR mess ? This is n't a natural disaster , it was caused by BP , and it should be BP 's responsibility to pay for whatever damage it caused . Why should Big Brother Government and my taxes pay for it ? Let Jindal go and tell BP to clean up their mess . If they do n't , then Louisiana should sue BP for the damage it caused . That 's what capitalism , the free market , and personal responsibility is all about , right ? As all parties realize that the lawsuits form this incident will result in setlements in the many many billions of dollars , keeping BP in the dock is fairly important . Ironically , this is a variation on the `` too big to fail '' fiscal problem - the only way the feds have any chance of making BP pay for the cleanup is to make sure PB can not cry that big government got in the way . Such officials as Bobby Jindal should rethink their desire to have the governemnt step in - it is antithetical to his basic political philosophy . If they can put those pipes in the water , underground or whereever , there should be shut-off vales every few miles . Did they think that the pipes are going to last forever , that they did n't need to put in shut-off valves ??? And another think , I certainly hope that they are not allowed to raise gas prices because of their errors . American people are already paying too much for gas . When the oil companies report millions and\\/or billions in profits , it 's wrong that american people are having to pay high prices for gas . I can not believe for the life of me that the government has not made the oil companies reduce gas prices . The oil companies could sell gas for $ 1.50 or $ 2.00 per gallon and still make millions and\\/or billions in profits . Looks to me like the oil companies are the ones that are gas gouging !!

He 'll do so as the crisis reaches yet another moment of high risk , both in the Gulf and in Washington . At the scene of the oil spill , the oil firm BP -- attempting the latest of inventive but thus far ineffective maneuvers to stop the gusher that has been spewing from the gulf floor for five weeks -- has begun to pour 50,000 barrels of dense mud into the well . The exercise , known as a '' top kill , '' has effectively stopped other spills in the past but has never been tried at the mile-down depth of this one . Meanwhile , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is scheduled to deliver the results of a review demanded by Obama that gives an accounting of the federal government 's policies with regard to energy exploration on the outer continental shelf , including whether there are adequate safeguards with respect to regulations and inspections . Obama is expected to announce a series of new policies in response . The news conference will also come on the day before the president travels to the gulf to inspect the scene and also to send a message of engagement . With reporters having their first opportunity to put a full range of questions to Obama about the spill and his administration 's handling of it , here are five that should be asked : 1 . In explaining and defending your decision in March to open up additional offshore areas to drilling , you argued that improvements in technology have made drilling significantly less risky . Just 18 days before the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , you said : `` It turns out , by the way , that oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills . They are technologically very advanced . '' What kind of assurances were you given that this was the case and by whom ? What do you think of those assumptions now ? BP is now in the position of making many of the key decisions on how to deal with it -- a situation that is drawing growing criticism . White House officials note the administration is following a process established under the 1990 Oil Spill Act , which was passed in response to the Exxon Valdez incident ; they also concede that the government , effectively , has no choice but to let BP take the lead because it lacks the equipment and expertise to do the job . In at least one instance in which the federal government has attempted to overrule BP , which was over its use of dispersant chemicals that the Environmental Protection Agency says are too toxic , the company has not complied . What do you say to those who say too much control has been ceded to BP ? And what kind of changes , if any , should be made in the process for dealing with future oil spills ? Salazar has pledged reform of the Minerals Management Servic e , the agency responsible for offshore drilling , which is now recognized as having been too compliant with the wishes of the oil industry . But his proposals -- for instance , splitting the agency into separate leasing , revenue collection and oversight -- have dealt largely with the organizaton of the MMS . If the problem is , as you have said , a cozy culture in the agency , is it enough simply to redraw the organization chart ? How can you quickly change a culture that has taken decades to develop ? On May 6 , Salazar announced a moratorium on the issuance of final permits for `` new offshore drilling activity . '' Critics such as the Center for Biological Diversity note , however , that this policy has never been put into writing , and that its definition `` has become steadily narrower as the Interior Department changes it to exclude whatever drilling permits MMS issues on any given day . '' And the New York Times has reported that since the April 20 explosion on the rig , waivers have continued to be granted for drilling projects . What , exactly , does this moratorium cover ? Should anyone in the government be fired as the result of this disaster ? Washington Post staff writer Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report .

Wednesday , May 26 , 2010 ; 4:16 PM Members of Congress from both parties sharply criticized the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service on Wednesday , a day after the release of a report showing that the agency 's inspectors routinely took gifts such as college football tickets from the companies they were supposed to be policing . Lawmakers unloaded about their concerns during a hearing by the House Natural Resources Committee on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The hearing followed the release of a memorandum by another panel , the House Energy and Commerce Committee , that described an internal BP investigation into the Gulf oil spill . The internal probe points to a series of equipment failures , mistakes and missed warning signs that led to the blowout and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , according to lawmakers briefed by the company . BP 's investigation , while incomplete , highlights a series of abnormal indicators -- about pipeline pressure and the flow of drilling fluids in the five hours before the explosion -- that should have been `` warning signs '' of trouble , according to the memo summarizing BP 's report . In one case , BP 's investigator told lawmakers that a `` fundamental mistake may have been made despite '' an indicator of a very large abnormality . Among other issues , BP said it had concerns about the cementing job in the well , saying that one procedure had to be attempted nine times , which might have indicated `` contamination of the cement . '' `` The BP investigation has also raised concerns about the maintenance history , modification , inspection , and testing of '' the blowout preventer , lawmakers said . `` In addition , key questions exist about whether proper procedures were followed for critical activities throughout the day , '' the memorandum said . These mostly had to do with the management of drilling mud , which is used as a counterweight to oil and gas pressure pushing up from below . On Capitol Hill , top Interior Department officials said Wednesday the Obama administration would hold federal agencies , as well as BP , accountable for any failings related to the devastating spill . In the first of a series of oversight hearings by the House Natural Resources Committee , which has jurisdiction over offshore oil and gas drilling , lawmakers grilled Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on reports of misconduct at the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , the Interior Department agency that regulates offshore drilling while also collecting revenue from it . `` This is a BP mess , '' Salazar said in response to questioning . But while it is important to get `` the whole truth '' from BP about what went wrong , he said , he has also ordered the department 's inspector general to look into what the MMS did or did not do that contributed to the problem . `` Everyone needs to be held accountable , and that includes the federal government , '' Salazar said . `` It is time to abolish MMS and start anew with a new agency and new people , '' Sen. Jeanne Shaheen -LRB- D-N.H. -RRB- said in a letter Wednesday to Salazar . News , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

Spillcam combines the dread of horror films with the monotony of Andy Warhol 's eight-hour silent movie of the Empire State Building . There is no sound and nothing happens , except the inexorable , unending flow . You watch a little , and then a little more , and then you ca n't stop watching as a steady plume of dark brown oil belches upward from the floodlit , rocky ocean floor . Depending on the depths of despair that spillcam can take you to , you might find yourself thinking of spillcam even when you 're not watching it . During Sunday night 's `` Lost '' finale , when a Target commercial featuring the show 's evil `` smoke monster '' made you think of the underwater oil plume . -LRB- The resemblance is uncanny . -RRB- You can be in bed and wake up in the middle of the night and think to yourself : It 's still coming out . Then you think : What if it never stops ? The Weather Channel shows spillcam in the morning . CNN flips to it all the time . And you can watch it online at work all day , in a browser window you ca n't help but return to . The House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , chaired by Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- , firmly requested last week that BP make public its live , continuous monitor footage of the spill . BP may own the camera , the committee said , but everyone needs to see the scope of the problem -- and see it at the source . The company agreed late last week and spillcam went live . The angle occasionally changes but the focus is always the leak . Every few seconds there 's a larger undulation within the pulsing rhythm of the gush . According to CNN , BP officials said Tuesday evening they would keep the spillcam feed running during the `` top kill , '' an attempt to inject tons and tons of mud into the pipe to plug up the leak . After a series of tests , the top kill plan might be put into action as soon as Wednesday morning . The top kill would be a lot of plot and drama for spillcam , and hopefully a season finale . Otherwise , spillcam almost never changes : Beneath the digital identification numbers imposed on the screen -LRB- with coordinates , the day 's date , and a clock ticking away -RRB- , it is always gray rock , yellow pipes , nasty plume . There are , of course , other ways to show this disaster , such as all those unsettling aerial pictures taken of oil slicks on the gulf 's surface . And on Tuesday 's `` Good Morning America , '' the show segued from spillcam to a boat off the Gulf Coast , from which the show 's dashing weather anchor , Sam Champion , donned scuba gear and dived beneath the gulf 's surface , accompanied by a camera and Jacques Cousteau 's even more dashing grandson , Philippe . There , beneath the blue surface , the two men were enveloped in a sick fog of brown globules . They came up looking like they had rolled around in the bowels of a Jiffy Lube . A crew hosed them off . And spillcam continues and continues : It has a way of highlighting one 's ignorance about geology , marine biology , energy exploration and ecology . It makes us wish we 'd been better earth-science students . Alas , everything I know about spillcam 's world I learned from `` The Abyss , '' James Cameron 's 1989 sci-fi film about deep-sea drillers who encounter underwater aliens . It 's on cable all the time -- Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio , and that black lady in the cowboy hat , and that scruffy tech guy with the pet rat . With their submarine robots and plucky know-how ? Spillcam aches for such heroes . Tuesday evening , the mud begins to swirl , and spillcam moves its position , and devoted viewers sit and stare , with a remote sense of hope for a happy ending .

New details included : -- BP 's chief representative was `` present '' on the rig during a discussion of an abnormal increase in pressure in the drill pipe , an indication that gas was probably in the pipe when it should n't have been . That representative never called the Houston office for advice , despite the indications of trouble and differences between him and the top Transocean person there . -- People on the rig should have known there was oil or gas in the drill pipe because when they were replacing drilling mud with seawater they only needed 352 barrels instead of 775 barrels . -- Pressure logs that were sent to BP 's Houston office via Halliburton suggested that rig workers tried to close valves on the blowout preventer at least twice in the final 18 minutes before the explosion that sank the rig . It remains unclear why that did not work . After the explosion , other efforts to activate the blowout preventer also failed . -- Earlier , BP officials on the rig and in Houston decided to run only six tests instead of 21 tests they originally planned to make sure that the drill pipe was centered in the well hole . If it had been off center , the unevenness might have contributed to flaws in the cement surrounding the pipe . The company said that it did not do the other centralizer tests because the correct pieces of equipment were not available the night before , and that the ones on hand ran the risk of breaking into three separate pieces . -- Workers on the rig made mistakes in placing a viscous liquid known as spacer fluid in the blowout preventer instead of further up the pipe to the surface . By doing so , company officials said that the fluid may have mixed with sea water and solidified , blocking a kill valve and distorting pressure in a key hose . -- Two valves known as flappers might not have closed in a device known as the shoe , which was supposed to guard against releases of gas from below . That might have undermined one of many obstacles to a blowout . -- The contractor handling the drilling mud moved it from tank to tank , making it hard to notice an increase in fluid that might have alerted rig workers to gas in the well . `` We can not see how fluid volumes were being monitored , '' said Bly . -- After the accident , BP discovered four leaks in the blowout preventer 's hydraulic system , which is supposed to help trigger the closing of valves in an emergency . Bly said that BP had briefed Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and congressional committees investigating the accident on the status of BP 's internal inquiry , just one of many investigations . Bly said `` we 're at the beginning '' and that new information could change what BP 's investigators are currently thinking . `` There are many things that we feel are far from conclusive , '' he said . `` This is very much a work we 're in the middle of .

BP engineers are pumping mud at a furious rate into the damaged blowout preventer that sits on the uncapped well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . The hazardous-but-high-reward maneuver comes five weeks into the oil spill crisis amid an intensifying atmosphere of political recrimination that has spread from the Gulf Coast to the White House and Congress . The early bulletins on the top kill were encouraging . `` The operation is proceeding as we planned it , '' BP chief executive Tony Hayward said Wednesday evening , adding that it would be 24 hours before BP knows if the well is dead . The billowing plumes of effluent from cracks in the top of the riser pipe no longer look like oil and gas but have a distinctly muddy appearance . `` What you 've been observing out of the top of that riser is most likely mud . We ca n't fully confirm that because we ca n't sample it , '' BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said at a news conference Wednesday night . Speaking cautiously , he noted that if all goes as hoped , the well could be cemented shut by Thursday night . President Obama , in a news conference Thursday , will outline tougher rules and regulations of the oil drilling industry and suspend exploratory drilling in the Arctic until at least next year , according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not been made . This will delay a controversial drilling effort by Shell this summer in the seas off northern Alaska . The moves come after a 30-day review of oil drilling that Obama ordered when the crisis began . BP officials , having studied pressure readings , finally pulled the trigger on the top kill at 2 p.m. . The world could follow the top kill via live video feeds from robots on the seafloor . It was strikingly similar to watching an Apollo moon landing : grainy images of unfamiliar technology in an alien landscape . The procedure pumps heavy drilling mud from a ship on the surface down to the seafloor and into the five-story blowout preventer atop the well . If all goes as planned , the mud will slide about 21\\/2 miles down to the bottom of the well bore , rendering the well `` static . '' Engineers would follow up with cement plugs to seal the well permanently . Much could go wrong . The pressure of the injected mud could damage the blowout preventer and exacerbate the leaks . The mud will go wherever it can , and not necessarily where the engineers would prefer . `` There 's a hole , but it 's kind of like pushing toothpaste through an obstacle course , '' said Bruce Bullock , director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University . `` I feel for the guys who are doing it , the people whose hands are actually on the throttles there , '' said energy analyst Byron King . `` It 's like doing brain surgery using robots under a mile of water with equipment that 's got 30,000 horsepower of energy inside of it . '' Millions of gallons of oil , and possibly tens of millions , have leaked into the gulf since the April 20 explosion and fire that killed 11 crew members on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , which sank two days later . Oil has touched 84 miles of Louisiana 's ragged shoreline and envelops the crow 's foot of the Mississippi River delta . The oil trajectory forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicates that some of the oil has been captured by the gulf 's Loop Current and by noon Friday could spread approximately as far south as , but considerably to the west of , Key West , Fla. . Traveling in Fremont , Calif. , Obama said Wednesday that the passage of energy legislation has become more urgent because of the oil spill , which he called `` just heartbreaking . '' Speaking to an audience of employees at a solar-panel manufacturing plant , Obama said the spill underscores the need to shift from fossil fuels to solar , wind and other types of power .

The scientists , aboard a University of South Florida research vessel , found an area of dissolved oil that is about six miles wide , and extends from the surface down to a depth of about 3,200 feet , said Professor David Hollander . Hollander said that he believed the plume might have stretched more than 20 miles from the site of a leak on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico , where the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank April 22 . It has not yet reached Florida . The plume is clear , with the oil entirely dissolved . `` Here is a situation where , unless you 're looking at the chemical fingerprints , -LRB- the oil -RRB- is absolutely not visible , '' Hollander said . `` It 's not some Italian vinaigrette or anything like that . It 's absolutely , perfectly clear . '' But , Hollander said , even this clear-looking water could contain enough oil to be toxic to small animals at the base of the gulf food chain . He said he was also worried that the oil contains traces of `` dispersants , '' soap-like chemicals sprayed into the oil to break it up . `` You do n't want to put soap into a fish tank , '' Hollander said . This discovery seems to confirm the fears of some scientists that -- because of the depth of the leak and the heavy use of chemical `` dispersants '' -- this spill was behaving differently than others . Instead of floating on top of the water , it may be moving beneath it . That would be troubling because it could mean the oil would slip past coastal defenses such as `` containment booms '' designed to stop it on the surface . Already , scientists and officials in Louisiana have reported finding thick oil washing ashore despite the presence of floating booms . It would also be a problem for hidden ecosystems deep under the gulf . There , scientists say , the oil could be absorbed by tiny animals and enter a food chain that builds to large , beloved sport-fish like red snapper . It might also glom on to deep-water coral formations , and cover the small animals that make up each piece of coral . `` It kills them because it prevents them from feeding , '' said Professor James H. Cowan Jr. , of Louisiana State University . `` It could essentially starve them to death . '' The University of South Florida vessel , the Weatherbird II , used sonar and other devices to sample the water below it . Other scientists have said they have little of the equipment necessary to find oil under the water -- leading to debates about whether the underwater plumes were even there . This week , Mike Utsler , who helps oversee the spill response off the entire Louisiana coast as BP Houma incident commander , said he 's only focused on taking oil off the surface . `` We do n't know there 's oil underwater , '' he said . But others had seen worrisome evidence . Owen Morgan of Amira , a group that specializes in breaking apart spills with oil-eating microbes , found evidence of the oil plume off Venice when his team sampled water 75 feet beneath the service . Morgan -- who said his company is pulling out of Louisiana because of insufficient cooperation from state and federal authorities -- showed a thick , gooey sample consisting of 60 percent crude oil . `` People do n't realize how bad it is , '' Morgan said , dipping a fork in the sample to show the goo that hung in midair without sliding off . `` This went on for three miles , of that consistency . '' William Hogarth , dean of the USF College of Marine Science , said university researchers have sent samples to federal officials for analysis , but it 's clear the oil is new because Stanford scientists had sampled the same area a year ago and found no evidence of oil . The Weatherbird II will conduct another tour next week , he said , with different researchers aboard . `` This is not natural seep , '' he said , adding that scientists will have to study the region for several years in order to properly gauge its impact . `` We 're talking about probably a three to five-year monitoring program to see what happens to food chain .

The fact that the answer to this question seems as murky as the water around the exploded oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico suggests that this is an excellent moment to recognize that our arguments pitting capitalism against socialism and the government against the private sector muddle far more than they clarify . Many tragic ironies are bubbling to the surface along with the oil . Consider the situation of Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , a Republican conservative who devoutly opposes the exertions of big government . `` The strength of America is not found in our government , '' Jindal declared in his response to President Obama 's February 2009 address to Congress . `` It is found in the compassionate hearts and the enterprising spirit of our citizens . '' But with his state facing an environmental disaster of unknown proportions , Jindal is looking for a little strength from Washington . His beef is that the federal government is n't doing enough to help . `` It is clear we do n't have the resources we need to protect our coast , '' he said this week , expressing his frustrations with `` the disjointed effort to date that has too often meant too little , too late . '' You ca n't blame Jindal for being mad . But will he ever acknowledge that `` compassionate hearts '' were not sufficient for coping with this catastrophe ? Did he ever ask BP how prepared it was for something like this ? Or was he just counting on the company 's `` enterprising spirit '' ? For its part , the Obama administration has not sent a consistent message . On Sunday , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar proclaimed outside of BP 's headquarters in Houston : `` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately . '' Not according to Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander . Speaking the next day at the White House , Allen observed : `` To push BP out of the way , it would raise a question : Replace them with what ? '' While Allen may not be a political philosopher , he spoke with the sophistication of one during an interview with CNN . `` What makes this an unprecedented anomalous event , '' he said , `` is access to the discharge site is controlled by the technology that was used for the drilling , which is owned by the private sector . '' So there you have it : `` Do something ! '' citizens shout to a government charged with protecting the environment in and around a Gulf of Mexico that is nobody 's private property . Yet the government , it seems , ca n't do much of anything because the means of stopping the flow of oil are entirely in the hands of a private company . BP was trusted to know what it was doing with complicated equipment that , it would appear , it either did n't understand very well or was willing to use recklessly . Belatedly , the Obama administration has realized that citizens can never accept the idea that their government is powerless . It is moving to show that it 's in charge , even when it is not . The president plans to visit the gulf again , on Friday , and on Wednesday , the White House called in a group of journalists for a briefing with Allen , who is earning a reputation for bluff candor . He spoke as the order was given to try to plug the well through a process colorfully called `` top kill . '' Allen was direct in saying that the law clearly places the responsibility for ending this spill with BP . He added that it was `` a legitimate line of inquiry '' as to whether this is where the power should be lodged . `` Are these public goods or private goods ? '' `` Who should produce them ? This is an absolutely legitimate question . '' It 's too bad this legitimate question was n't asked a long time ago . Allen rightly urged that Congress 's decision to place so much authority with private companies be reviewed by the commission investigating the spill . And there will surely be an inquest into how such a potentially dangerous technology got by with so little regulatory oversight . Before we drill offshore again , we should pause , baby , pause . `` Deregulation '' is wonderful until we discover what happens when regulations are n't issued or enforced . Everyone is a capitalist until a private company blunders . Then everyone starts talking like a socialist , presuming that the government can put things right because they see it as being just as big and powerful as its Tea Party critics claim it is . But the truth is that we have disempowered government and handed vast responsibilities over to a private sector that will never see protecting the public interest as its primary task . The sludge in the gulf is , finally , the product of our own contradictions . "}, {"uid": "1923", "dct": "2010-05-27", "dates": [null, null], "text": "ON BARATARIA BAY , LA. -- In the Louisiana marsh , oil-coated pelicans flap their wings in a futile attempt to dry them . A shorebird repeatedly dunks its face in a puddle , unable to wash off . Lines of dead jellyfish float in the gulf , traces of oil visible in their clear `` bells . '' These scenes , scientists say , are confirmation of what they had feared for a month . Now that oil from the Gulf of Mexico 's vast spill has come ashore -- in some places , as thick as soft fudge -- it is causing serious damage in one of the country 's great natural nurseries . In nature , oil is a versatile killer . It smothers the tiny animals that make up a coral reef . It suffocates blades of marsh grass , cutting them off from air and sunlight . It clumps up a bird 's feathers , leaving it unable to fly ; then , trying to remove the oil , birds swallow it . For now , scientists are seeing the worst effects only in one corner of the Louisiana coast . But they 're concerned about what they 're not seeing -- and worried that the impact on animals and plants will only get worse . `` Now that the stuff is really sort of coming ashore , it really is living up to its potential . It 's certainly breached the sort of outer defense system of Louisiana , '' said James H. Cowan Jr. , a professor at Louisiana State University . `` It 's the very worst-case scenario for things like birds and mammals . '' On Wednesday , the oil company BP started a `` top kill '' of its leaking well , 5,000 feet below the surface and more than 40 miles off Louisiana . The procedure involves shooting high-pressure mud into the well , hoping the mud coming in will eventually overwhelm the oil shooting out . But even if that works , it will do nothing to rein in the oil that has escaped . That oil began washing up in Louisiana last week , about a month after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank . It first appeared in the remote marshes near the Mississippi River 's mouth . Then , this week , it began washing into the vast complex of islands , lakes and bayous just west of the river . `` Unfortunately , it 's looking like a real oil spill now , '' said Larry McKinney , who heads the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies , part of Texas A&M University . `` This is the stuff that does the damage . '' On Tuesday morning , Louisiana scientists ventured out here into Barataria Bay , looking for oil and oil-covered animals . Near Isle Grande Terre , a brown pelican -- the state bird -- sat atop a piling , its chest and head feathers matted down with oil . As the boat approached , it flew away . But within seconds , the pelican alighted on a nearby rock . It was already too weak to fly long distances .

First thoughts on President Obama 's oil spill press conference Below are our first thoughts on what the takeaway from the press conference will be as the President heads to the Gulf tomorrow . \\* The government = boss : From his opening statement to his answers to just about every oil spill-related question , President Obama made clear that BP was working under orders from the federal government , not the other way around . `` Make no mistake , '' he said . `` BP is operating at our direction . '' The repeated emphasis on that point is designed to rebut criticism that the Obama Administration deferred to BP in the clean-up effort . It 's a complicated argument to make . Because BP has been leading on the technological side -- as the President noted , the company is far better equipped than the government to figure out how to fix the problem -- but not on the overall strategy and direction of the effort . It 's a nuanced argument to make and a distinction that Obama has to hope average Americans understand . : It was clear from the very start of the press conference that Obama understood that he and his team were back on their heels politically when it came to the situation in the Gulf . And so , he methodically set out to emphasize that from the minute the oil rig accident occurred that he and his Administration have understood the gravity of the situation and the need to act quickly . `` This is what I wake up to in the morning and this is what I go to be tonight thinking about , '' Obama said about the spill . He added that his Administration is operating under a `` constant sense of urgency '' about the matter and noted that he convened a meeting of his top advisers in the Oval Office on the same day he learned of the accident . `` This has been our highest priority since this crisis occurred , '' he said . While Obama rejected the comparisons to how the Bush Administration handled Hurricane Katrina -- `` I will leave it to you guys to make those comparisons , '' he said -- it 's clear that the perceived detachment from President George W. Bush during that crisis is deeply impacting how Obama and his White House are seeking to handle this one . \\* I feel your pain : Obama is not the most naturally empathetic politician -- that would be Bill Clinton -- but he does understand the need , in moments like this one , to make clear to people that he feels this stuff in his gut . Obama repeatedly used the word `` frustrated '' to explain his feelings ; `` I am angry and frustrated as well , '' he said in the early moments of the presser . He also sought to make clear to those in the affected area that he would not -- again the ghost of Katrina lingered -- forget about them . `` We are not going to abandon our fellow citizens , '' said Obama . But Obama , ever the political realist , acknowledged that the only way to change how people feel about the spill is to end it ; `` People are going to be frustrated until it stops , '' he said . \\* Tough visuals : The difficulty of Obama 's political positioning on the oil spill was made plain when MSNBC and CNN went to a two-shot -- showing both the President as well as the punctured pipe continuing to spew into the Gulf Coast . On the one hand , Obama was asserting that he and his government were doing absolutely everything to solve the problem ; on the other , the picture of the pipe served as a stirring reminder that the problem still is n't fixed . Have thoughts of your own after watching the press conference ? Offer them in the comments section below . By Chris Cillizza | May 27 , 2010 ; 2:08 PM ET Posted by : raynetherwood | May 30 , 2010 1:59 PM | Report abuse How long has BP been in business ? BP is drilling in international waters like a startup company without knowledge that it is possible to drill into pockets of high pressure that could cause an incident like this . They were not , and are not , capable of shutting down the flow of petroleum and until it is shut down there is essentially nothing the administration can do to stop it from befowling our shores . The oil permeates every level of the Gulf from the sea bed to the surface and the technology does not exist to deal with a disaster of this magnitude . It can not be burnt off , it can not be blocked from reaching the coast and dispersants are inadequate to reach the sea bed . If men were placed shoulder to shoulder on the coast they could not prevent this disaster from reaching our shores . The only thing that can be done is to clean up as quickly as possible to minimize the damage as much as possible . Those of you who complain that the administration is not doing anything should share your ideas as to how to stop this disaster or heist your sorry behinds down to the Gulf Coast to lend a hand . You complain about to much government and now you complain that there is too little . You ca n't have it both ways . I am not sure that the U.S. Government has DIRECT authority to impose orders to BP or Transocean ... Possibly over Haliburton . One other issue -LRB- as an aside -RRB- : survivors of the explosion were muzzzled from making any accusatory comments regarding possible negligence on the part of Haliburton , Transocean or BP , and were virtually compelled to sign waivers before being returned to the mainland . This was reported on NPR , but no where else , as far as I know . I am not sure that the U.S. Government has DIRECT authority to impose orders to BP or Transocean ... Possibly over Haliburton . One other issue -LRB- as an aside -RRB- : survivors of the explosion were muzzzled from making any accusatory comments regarding possible negligence on the part of Haliburton , Transocean or BP , and were virtually compelled to sign waivers before being returned to the mainland . This was reported on NPR , but no where else , as far as I know . Obama has had and continues to have the best treatment from the left-stream media -- ABC , CBS , NBC , CNN , NY Times , Washington Post , etc. -- than any president in modern history . Obama 's problem is he has no executive experience -- he has never run anything , not even a very small business . He does n't understand that his political hack friends he put into power will blame him after they get accused of wrong-doing . Then , Obama will be `` hanging out to dry '' after he gets soaked . `` I was in charge from day one . '' `` The decisions were mine , not BP . '' As the oil sludge washes into Louisiana 's bayous , remember Obama is in charge , and was in charge from day one . You may as well be . What a pathetic , disingenuous report . He -LRB- Obama -RRB- speaks loudly and with forked tongue I am responsible and have been since day one - make no mistake about it . . BP is responsible for this mess . Translation - when it 's fixed I ' l take credit , until them BP = Bad People , Bad People . I 'm indicting the press for this . You are failing us on a daily basis allowing this BS to continue . As long as we are addicted to oil and a life style that is not sustainable without exploitation of the environment and the resources of this country and others , we will continue to have environmental disasters . Is n't it about time that we grow up and realize we ca n't have everything we want ? I find it troubling that this is the first press conference that this administration has held since July ! That was almost 9 months ago ! One way Obama could have avoided some of the current criticism is to have engaged , and answered reporters ' questions earlier . He should of had a press conference in the first week of this disaster . Say and think what you want about Bush but at least he held press conferences , and for better or often times worse , faced the scrutiny of reporters . Cushy interviews at the white house basketball court do n't count as press conferences . It is easy to sound eloquent when reading off of a teleprompter , but is more difficult when one has to think on their feet in the face of difficult questions . Why the previous attempts ? Was it a matter of BP trying to stop the leak at the least cost , rather than stop it at any cost ? Obama is just too calm with things but his response hs been engaging . He just has a PR problem . Also next time all hacks want deregulation and small government , Remember this oil spill and then preach that crap . Do not pretend to be for the enviroment like Hannity and Laura Ingraham who want to drill baby drill . Clean coal is a joke . Think about real clean energy - China and Europe are . Oh no , America is wrong and we should look to Europe . Someone call Glen Beck and have me labeled a Nazi or Marxist . Wait Beck does not even know where his left hand is . It 's in today 's ; TODAY 's Portland Press Herald . yet , Maine 's inventory of acclaimed oil spill containment booms left the warehouse YESTERDAY . GOVERNEMENT = BOSS ???? ... credibility gap widened considerably , completely passing the Pat Schroeder ` straight face ' test ... she also said '' Men play the game ; women know the score and now it 's measured in gallons of crude released over 40 days that WERE NOT CLEANED UP BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION . Obama 's street organizer game of B. S'ing the uneducated has worn thin . America is losing in the Gulf ; losing in Korea ; losing in Iran ; and using robots to commit genocide in Pakistan and Afghanistant . How do we keep Obama from destroying America ? She is nice but fairly partisan as well . On a side note , someone from EPA called me and asked about some analytical methodology I had worked on -LRB- they were interested in applying it to measure dispersant in the water -RRB- . I downloaded all my information to my EPA contact in a matter of seconds -LRB- I didn t say I had a lot of experience -RRB- and this included salutations . After the phone call , I was initially honored than I thought those guys are really in trouble if they are calling me for advise , but then again maybe they wanted to know how not to approach an issue . Ooooh they are good . I personally do see this event similar to Bush s Hurricane Katrina . I did not fault either president since in both cases the events overwhelmed the system . Who can be prepared for a Category 5 Hurricane hitting the coast with a city that is basically underwater from the start or be prepared for deep ocean blow out of an oil rig . Or for that matter and election that is decided by only a few votes . Our systems work when we have large margins . I would note there was a lot of good findings following Katrina especially simple ones like evacuating pets as well as people -LRB- simple but profound in its impact -RRB- . I am sure following this disaster there will be a lot of new key findings that will make us better prepared for such an event and preventing such an event . However , I heard a lot from the left about incompetent government during Katrina and Obama used Katrina often as a metaphor for change during his campaign . The same people -LRB- government workers -RRB- who served Clinton efficiently also served Bush ineffectively -LRB- Katrina -RRB- and these are the same ones serving Obama . You can not fault one president without faulting the other president , but that is what people on the left and right do all the time and both do it equally . Your approach is one that says if Obama says it , it must be true . Not very discerning Mr. Cillizza . LOVE your line that talks about the difference between fixing the leak a coordinating the strategy and direction of the effort . You tell us it 's `` a nuanced argument to make and a distinction that Obama has to hope average Americans understand . '' Oh , do n't worry , we understand `` real good '' and YOU do n't even need you to explain it to us . Do you understand the distinction between stopping the leak and leading a coordinated effort to clean up the spill ? Because that is what people are most upset about . Yes , BP is responsible ... now clean it up and send them the bill ! The emergency plan the government had in place , that was supposed to be acted on immediately , was never done . They did not even have the equipment of booms and starting fires . They never even had the equipment on hand that they should have by LAW . Also , he has never even said a word about Nashville . A horrible disaster and not a word . He is too simple minded to understand anything about this situation . The reason they drill in 5,000 feet of water , 50 miles offshore is because the federal government wo n't let them drill any closer . The easy to extract oil is NOT gone - the government will not let them take it . There is plenty of oil under the stinkin ' beach , for God 's sake . The reason the drilling is so risky is because the government makes them drill 50 miles offshore in water a mile deep . Drilling in the beach or 2 miles offshore would be much , much safer and cheaper . And there is plenty of oil there . Again , the guy is a total incompetent . And his claim of being in charge is ludicrous . He has done two vacations and numerous fundraisers since the blow . He only answered the plea from Bobby Jindal for permits to dredge up sand for protective islands today . A week or more after the request . And he has refused help from tech experts all over the world . The guy is an incompetent fool . Maybe we can impeach him for trying to buy off Sestej with the illegal offer of an admin job to drop his run against Arlen Spector . -LRB- Then we 'd get Biden - at least we 'd get a triple digit IQ - barely . -RRB- Are you going to keep with this new style , or revert to the partisan tone ? They have to be really careful - the risk of an explosion is high - that is why they did n't try this for a long time - if it explodes , the equipment below will be detroyed even more , and the leak will be worse . I 'm not sure if allowing the drilling mud to leak out is any better than the oil - my general feeling is the drilling mud is worse for the environment than the oil . You have no basis to complain about anyone after what you have done . What is wrong with you ? People who are passionate think that moderation is some kind of character flaw . Rush Limbaugh has a particular disdain for moderates and calls them squishy and unsure . Spoken as only a truly passionate person would view it . I am by nature moderate -LRB- I think -RRB- and consider moderation to be what is called a judicial temperament . Moderation , to me , means trying to withhold strong opinion to enable more facts to be considered . Once you take a position , it is human nature to defend that opinion , even if flawed . I find it painful to try discussing a subject with a passionate person . Whether I agree or disagree with him , usually I learn nothing new because new information is not presented in a credible way . Exaggeration undermines credibility , in my opinion . As soon as I see `` always '' and `` never '' and `` completely '' , I discount the writer 's opinion . All the dispersants is doing is serving to HIDE the oil beneath the surface - it is still coming ashore . It would have been FAR BETTER TO BURN OFF THE CRUDE . The problem is the ENVIRONMENTALISTS - THINKING THEY KNOW EVERYTHING - DID N'T WANT TO LET THAT HAPPEN - THEY DID N'T WANT TO DO WHAT WAS REQUIRED - WHICH WAS POUR KEROSENE ON IT TO LIGHT IT - Posted by : 37thand0street | May 27 , 2010 11:40 PM | Report abuse 12Bar -- that 's the unfortunate thing about this board ... it could be an actual public space for open policy discussion . But the lack of moderation makes this impossible . If you mean the former , I do n't know if it would help a lot . Real Clear Politics is moderated , but it 's gruesome . Anyone who is not a raving partisan gets the hell out of there fast . If you mean moderate people , then I agree with you . If the blog was only liberal , for example , the posters could moderate their opinions because they would n't be on the defensive . Likewise , if the blog was only conservative . Conservatives would n't feel like they have to defend their point of view . I would be interested in another blog that was n't so defensive . I know there are lots of issues I need to become more informed about , and truly I would welcome an exchange that was more curious and less accusatory . But the lack of moderation makes this impossible . I would welcome a discussion about what you see . I am open in exploring what the government could\\/should have done . And BP , too . At least it would n't be one of these pointless shouting matches that is all about exaggeration . When I see the words `` utterly , completely , incompetent , racist , or affirmative action '' I just shut off . Waste of time and frivolous . Some of the contents of the `` spill response toolbox '' include , in clockwise order from the upper left , dispersants , skimmers , booms , and burning . Dispersants are usually used in conjunction with these other cleanup techniques . '' Oh , that 's you with the crystal ball . We have Obama - WHO STOPPED THE PRE-APPROVE PLAN TO BURN IT OFF . THAT IS OBAMA 'S SCANDAL - WHY WAS N'T THE PLAN FOLLOWED - WHY HAS N'T THE OIL BEEN BURNED OFF . This is the ENVIRONMENTALISTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHO THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING - THEY CONVINCED OBAMA NOT TO BURN IT OFF . I did n't throw out a stereotype - I had actual conversations with actual white guys who said these things . I could name names . I mean , besides Obama . This has served the rich and powerful very well , with low tax rates for the highest incomes and lax regulation so that companies like BP , GS , and Massey can do whatever they want , including total disregard for safety and the environment . With the financial crisis , the oil crisis , and the mining crisis , it could n't be more clear that this strategy does n't work . BP spent 15 days trying to get the blowoff valve working . If they had gotten it to close , the well would have been capped . They used dispersant all through this period because dispersant helps keep the oil from the shore and minimizes danger to fisheries . Using dispersant means the oil is not on the surface to be burned off . If someone had a crystal ball , and had known the BOV was defective , and that the cofferdam would not work , and that the tophat technique would n't work , and that the sippy tube would not be fully effective , and that shoveling mud down the hole would fail -LRB- as it presently is -RRB- , THEN maybe they would n't have used dispersant . Or maybe they would . Everything is a tradeoff . And yet we continue to hear from you saying this or that . You guy Obama FAILED - he has no idea what he is doing . FINALLY WE HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN A JOB WHICH HE CAN NOT HANDLE . Clearly - Obama is on vacation , then another vacation - FUNDRAISING IN CALIFORNIA AT THE GETTY MANSION . THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE HURT THIS COUNTRY BADLY BY FORCING THE COUNTRY TO HAVE THIS THIRD RATE GOVERNMENT IN A CRISIS . The democratic party is RESPONSIBLE for the FAILURES OF OBAMA . The democrats FORCED Obama - the affirmative action , inexperienced , no buiness experience , no economic experiend - OH YES COCAINE-EXPERIENCED guy - on this nation . Is that too transparent for him ? Why does he need a team of lawyers , a barricade of poll tested wording and a bureau of pr professionals to craft a reply ? Is that too transparent for him ? Why does he need a team of lawyers , a barricade of poll tested wording and a bureau of pr professionals to craft a reply ? is in charge , then why did BP more or less tell the EPA to go to hell when the EPA told them to stop using that chemical they were using to break up the oil ? To my knowledge , as of 5-27-2010 at 9:10 pm they are still using this very toxic enviromental and human toxic chemical . obummer better take the blame for this . He 's denying everything Gov. Jendal is asking for . Maybe we should have the Pres. of Mexico call obummer and demand he does what Gov. Jendall asks for . That 's the reason obummer is not sending what we need to cover and close our border . Pres. Calderon told him not to do it . So he thinks he satisfied the Am . People by sending 1200 troops down there to sit at desks . This way he obeyed Calderon 's order not to protect our border . Do n't you ever get tired of that schtick ? It 's called hubris . he should have dived down and plugged it himself '' . There 's been a Federal response plan in the works for just such an incident since 1994 . It 's called the `` In -- Situ Burn '' plan , and calls for an immediate use of fire booms , which , according to tests that were conducted then , and former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oil Spill coordinator Ron Gouquet , would have burned off 95 % of all the oil spilling into the Gulf for the last 37 days . Comrade Obama and his Keystone Cop -- like administation did nothing , and this mess was the result ! He \\*\\* , he did n't even mention the BP oil spill , nor cared about it for 9 days after it happened -LRB- GW Bush got crucified for waiting 4 days after Katrina , and he had to disregard the Stafford Act which in fact made it illegal for him to intervene , something Comrade Obama did n't have to contend with -RRB- . Appoint people on a colorblind basis , based only on qualifications . OTHERWISE , YOU GET A THIRD RATE GOVERNMENT WHICH CAN NOT HANDLE THE JOB . Tough - you do n't like it . The poster who writes about racism just does it to get others to respond to him . He 'll keep ratcheting up the provocation until he snags someone . I doubt he even believes his own post .

The problem is that these issues get politicized and ordinary people fall into this magical thinking trap . `` If the President is `` tough '' well , then the well gets capped sooner . '' A lot of people see every problem through a political lens . The `` tough '' language is strictly for public consumption . If the government needs to get tough with BP , they 'll do it quite effectively , in private . What with all the bball and golf and vacations and speeches and apologies and finger pointing and Posted by : Moonbat | May 27 , 2010 9:56 PM | Report abuse The major problem - you do n't want to hear the major problem here - because you will harass and complain and whine like a sissy forever . But against my better judgement I will respond . The environmentalists in this country CAUSED THIS CRISIS - they do n't want drilling on the land , so it goes offshore , They do n't want it near shore , so now it is in mile-deep water - where it is difficult to plug the oil spill . IF THIS WERE ON LAND , IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLUGGED A MONTH AGO . The real situation - is the environmentalists have BEEN SO UNREALISTIC - THEY HAVE FILLED UP EVERY EVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCY - STATE AND FEDERAL - AND THEY HAVE WASTED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON STUPID IDEAS . They have created a HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS . The environmentalists have not created a working partnership with anyone - instead EVERYONE IS A `` RESPONSIBLE PARTY '' - and you are responsible for UNLIMITIED LIABILITIES EVEN IF YOU DIDNT CAUSE THE PROBLEM . Yes , you may hate it - but the truth is if you own a piece of property - AND ANYONE polluted it - over the past 500 years YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP You can go bankrupt , they do n't care . You can spend all your retirement savings , they do n't care . They just want everything go back to Pristine Wilderness . Why did he not do the same for the people killed on the oil rig ? One accident is the same as another , is n't it , in its tragedy ? To me his hesitancy to be a champion of the innocent people fighting the tragedy consequences of the events shows he is too calculating in his political fallout analysis - an overreaction to Bush 's perceived cluelessness is Obama 's scapegoat posturing -LRB- `` boot to the throat '' is not a way to treat your partner in fixing a problem and is as immature a statement as Bush 's call to `` Bring 'em on '' to Iraqi terrorists -RRB- . Most of the complaints I 've heard in my life about affirmative action have been from middle-aged white guys who have n't gotten as far up the ladder in their careers as they apparently believe they have the right to be . And they complain about women taking their jobs at least as much as they complain about African Americans . Can it , guys . Name the particular incompetent bureaucrats you object to - do n't make fuzzy-headed racist\\/sexist remarks . If you do n't know who they are , find out . You 're all internet experts . Right now , there are a couple of things more important than politics , and that is the oil spill and the state of my portfolio . I do n't give a good g \\* damn who or how the well\\/oil\\/financial industry gets proper regulation , but I want it done . I do n't make everything political -- industry has its role , government has its role . If you get the balance right , you get stability . If the balance gets mucked up , you get financial collapse , mysterious market swings like May 6 , uncappable oil wells . I am a pro business person , always have been . I worked in venture capital for years , and you do n't get more capitalistic than that . I believe in the free market , but I also believe in appropriate regulation . If you want to blame Obama because people blamed Bush , go right ahead . I really do n't care . Lot of wasted energy , in my opinion . Politicians and government are peripheral to most problems in the real world . I 'd rather focus on getting the well capped , getting the regulation right , getting the cleanup done as well as possible , than making silly and tangential political points . Whether Obama thinks about the well 24\\/7 or just once in a blue moon , will not mean a damn thing in capping the well . The onus is on BP and its experts . You seem to think that someone has the magic answer . I think you are dead wrong . Come on - all these affirmative action minority APPOINTEES OF OBAMA have no clue what they are doing . It is 37 days into this and they still have no clue . OH WAIT - let me quote a section of the statute of 1990 and maybe that will do something ... ... OBAMA has NO CLUE - he has filled the government with the first minority in this position and the first minority in that position But in a crisis , THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS COMPLETELY PARALYZED . oH WAIT , THEY CAN BLAME SOMEONE ELSE . As if Bush was supposed to immediately BEAM EVERYONE IN NEW ORLEANS OUT TO NICE HOUSES IN THE SUBURBS ON HIGH GROUND LIKE IT WAS SOME STAR TREK EPISODE . Seriously , the democrats FOR YEARS have been unrealistic . Now you are complaining that someone else might be unrealistic ??? Go to your local democratic party headquarters and complain there . How is your affirmative action guy doing now ? Actual qualifications are not considered . Take Obama - way too many people in this country decided they would vote for him based on the COLOR OF HIS SKIN . The truth is the same man with the same resume - only WHITE - would NEVER HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FOR PRESIDENT OR EVEN US SENATOR . THE NATION IS NOW STUCK WITH A THIRD RATE GOVERNMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS . HOW IS THAT POST-RACIAL THING WORKING FOR YOU NOW ???? Posted by : 37thand0street | May 27 , 2010 9:13 PM | Report abuse 12 bar . The point here is that the federal government is utterly incompetent and worthless at everything it does . To consider that we need more and bigger is getting more preposterous by the day . Since when is the government supposed to be oil exploration experts ? I thought that was the oil exploration industry 's job . The point here is that the federal government is utterly incompetent and worthless at everything it does . To consider that we need more and bigger is getting more preposterous by the day . The government should take over the operation and ignore BP . BP should take over the operation and ignore the government . Foreign oil experts should take over the operation and ignore BP & the government . Experts in oil drilling , but not connected to the oil industry should take over the operation and ignore everyone . Easy and obvious answers were ignored by everyone . Any clown could stop the gusher with common sense . I think all of this is b.s. . We better get ready to accept what is obvious . None of us arm-chair quarterbacks know what to do , or would be doing anything different than what is being done . The whole exploration industry , worldwide , is contributing to this effort . The essential problem is that once the blow off valve failed , we have NO technology to cap this well . We are probably waiting for another 2 months until the cross drilling relieves the pressure . The gubmnt could not control it 's wayout of a paper bag . The windbag is running out of wind . I just wanted to say that Mr. Obama s appearance today was void of any statements of leadership and full of self aggrandizement and blaming everyone from Bush to BP and it took him an hour to say it . Whew , he s taking the democratic party down one day at a time . After the eight days it took him and his staff to wake up the damage was done . The government seems to hate Louisiana . They could have saved the marshland if they had done what the locals know to do . But , that had to be approved and took weeks to even come to the surface as having been requested . The only thing that can save face for him now is to fire the two goofballs he sent down there . They 'll come crawling out late at night after we 've left the building . And the democrats did n't do their job . NOW we have a situation in which OBAMA REALLY IS RESPONSIBLE - AN OFFSHORE SITUATION and the democrats are HORRIFIED THAT THEY NOW DESERVE IT WORSE THAN THEY GAVE BUSH . All the antics of the democrats over the past 8 years are now becoming EXPOSED . EVERYTHING THEY DID TO BUSH IS NOW FAIR GAME . Posters , Hitler-mustaches - nasty signs - all what the democrats did to Bush - that is OK . But anyone does it to Obama - and the democrats cry . The democrats are NOT FIT to govern - the oil spill response has been AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION NIGHTMARE . INCOMPETENT PEOPLE APPOINTED TO POSITIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS IN . THE OIL SPILL RESPONSE IS AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION NIGHTMARE . A majority -- 53 % -- say the same about Obama . '' Billy Nungesser , Parish President in Plaquemines , La. says `` the response to this has been worse than Katrina . '' Well , at least we got a speech . This is Obama 's baby now , which is why the left is starting to get even crazier . Obama is not even in crisis mode . Obama is about to take his SECOND vacation since the spill - and just got back from a FUNDRAISING TRIP TO CALIFORNIA . This is reeforced by the fact that the President went to Calif. for 3 fundraisers - one held in the Getty home - thus giving rise to the perception that he was not fully engaged in the process . No matter what he says or does , it will be impossible to erase this image . Secondly , it is obvious that , if they were in charge , the Coast Guard did n't get the memo : They have been an obstruction refusing to authorize any actions until the paper pushers got done with their Impact statemenst . Guess what - the impact has happened and the oil is in the marshes and will be difficult if not impossible to clean up . There is enough blame to go around - The state and local governments waited around to get permission to deploy barriers - they should have remembered the old adage - it is easier to get forgiveness then to get permission . To parapharse George Bush - - `` You all are doing a heck of a job . '' Do n't like what happens when you Drill , Baby , Drill ? Have to throw a punch at the administration that 's mopping up after your miserable attempt at governance . Do n't talk to me about Obama . YOU are to blame for the Gulf disaster , for the Wall Street debacle -LRB- `` Let the market decide '' you all proudly parroted . I hold the GOP voters and Bush Cheney responsible for putting their faith in corporations who do n't care about anything but their bottom line , and are so powerful that they OWN enough of Congress to stop or water down any reforms decent people try to make . It 's all Bush 's fault . Big business does n't own the Democrats , just the Republicans . We can stop drilling and just import ALL of our oil . But then what if we have a problem with a tanker ? Well , that would be Bush 's fault , too ! But Bobby the dreamer has a Republicans response to complicated problems , just do something pretty stupid and then blame someone else when it does n't work . BP gave YOU millions in campaign money , no wonder you do n't push on them ... '' Obama 's donations from Oil companies : $ 800K McCain 's donations from oil companies : $ 2.7 mil Right , Obama was big oil 's man ... . No , I guess that would n't be your thing - ca n't download porn and work at the same time , right ? No one believes it but the loons . Not just here , everywhere on the blogosphere ... trying to confuse the American public . It just so happens that no matter how many liars there are , President Obama projected a commanding presence today and those images will be shared with the general public over the airwaves tonight and going forward . Face it , losers , you LOST THE ELECTION and your fraudulent attacks on President Obama will LOSE . Do n't like it ? I guess since Obama 's speech , all that oil has just disappeared . It was all a big lie . This is what passes for liberal thought . The War Room , actually the response team headquarters , has been in operation in Houston since the problem started . Stocked chock full of deep water engineers from all over , with the ability and authority to call up deep water assets from wherever they can get to the site . -LRB- Start with the Plum Line and keep looking . -RRB- It is so easy to armchair second guess when you do not have all the facts , which we looking in from the outside , do not have . Separate issue from stopping the leak . Democrats decided to gamble on the nation 's well being - seeing if an affirmative action candidate who was also a former cocaine user could handle the job as President . The McCain\\/Palin campaign received approx . three times as much as Obama 's . Perhaps you were n't around in 2008 , but Drill Baby Drill chants were heard in Minneapolis , not Denver . I do n't think anyone received more money from BP than Obama . Maybe more money from big oil in general . Check out what happened to your tweet column on this . She 's a Darwinian dead end . Ca n't seem to function in an environment where her wild-eyed political theories are challenged . In her world , all of life 's little problems can be answered with one of three responses : Posted by : Brigade | May 27 , 2010 7:51 PM | Report abuse It is immaterial that Obama called his people around a table in the White House to discuss the Deepwater Horizon explosion and the oil spill . He had the wrong people , none of them had the least idea of the available technology , or even who to call . The secretary of Energy is an academic . The Sect ' y of Interior is antipathetic to petroleum . The entire Administration was more interested in blaming than addressing the problem . Today , leaders in LA have decided to proceed with plans that they know will work , but have been delayed for weeks by the Feds . They 're willing to risk jail to do that . Biz leaders in NOLA issued a statement a few minutes ago again begging Obama to set a `` war room '' in the region to coordinate the efforts of the State , Feds , and private sector . The best minds with access to the latest technology , which the Administration has not even begun to utilize . How can they direct BP ? All the WH has done is impede the clean-up . The Administration has failed . There is a lack of management ability at the highest levels and an unwillingness to admit what they do not know . They are not now , nor have they been for one minute , `` in charge '' of anything . They do n't know how . I had commented in an earlier thread that Scooter Libby was not convicted of outing Valerie Plame , or even knowing who did , but was caught in a perjury\\/obstruction trap in the investigation . But this supposedly successful attorney failed to grasp the purpose of the post or my comments on the John Adams project . He accused me of not knowing Libby was convicted and of changing the subject . However , the subject ot the Plame investigation was the outing of a CIA agent and that was the purpose of my response to his ignorant allegation . It looks like the same guy who got Libby is going after the John Adams Project and the traitorous ACLU lawyers . Hopefully , they can all join the she-male Lynne Stewart in prison . If leichtman1 has any character at all , I would expect him to be more interested in the actual outing of CIA operatives than busting Scooter Libby . From a column by Mark Thiessen , `` The double standard here is incredible . Contrast the relentless investigation of the Valerie Plame leak with the foot-dragging of the Obama administration in the case of ACLU lawyers who not only exposed the identities of real covert operatives , but shared this information directly with our nation s enemies . The Miller amendment is simply intended to ensure that their actions receive the proper investigation and that any future violations of our laws and national security policies will similarly be investigated . It s about time . '' Unless we SHOVE HIM BACK ... the cost of 30 MILLION ... -LRB- do n't believe that 10-12 million crap - that was 10 years ago -RRB- ... will break our backs .

I have informed the IT department and they are in the process of tracking who you are . Just wanted to give you a heads up as this is the type of thing that can get your tenure revoked . Mainly those who apparently expected him to put on a wet suit , dive down to the sea bottom , and wedge himself into the leak -- stopping it with a superhuman effort worthy of Mr. Fantastic -LRB- Reed Richards -RRB- . They might just do that . CC calls the Republican structure fire unorthodox nominees , heh , heh . But just because he is my guy , that does not mean he is a genius , The One , or beyond criticism . ceflynline , my kids ' baseball game -LRB- again -RRB- is in one hour , but I get your point . If I have time tonight , I 'll respond . Briefly , I do n't agree with the premise . Was it Union Carbide -LRB- who ? -RRB- , but they will never be forgotten in Bhopal . Who made Chernobyl ok ? This is not some oil spill and BP knew that . Our government flying wing for BP is crazy . What is this `` unified command '' propaganda device ? look , a cleaned bird released to the wild , lets have a press release on our web site . Was it two weeks ago the BP CEO said on camera he expected the environmental damage to be minimal ? He has since retracted , but did people really think it would all just disappear when the gusher got stopped ? That is what Obama was doing - instead of working on the oil spill . Obama JUST GOT BACK FROM A FUNDRAISING TRIP TO CALIFORNIA . He tries to be an expert but is n't , and people are finally seeing through the smokescreen . He is a typical `` this is how it should be '' politician who does not know how to get anything done . If he shut up once and instead put his butt on the line and did some work , people might start to listen to him , but with the way he acts and lectures down to people like he is the smartest person in the room , well , people just are sick of him and his lies and ignorance . NO OBAMA 'S HIGHEST PRIORITY WAS SMEARING THE REPUBLICANS ON THE WALL STREET BILL . Come on - can he get serious ? The feds , beginning with the teleprompter-in-charge sock-puppet do n't have a clue how to stop the disaster . Their only expertise is in finding a scapegoat while protecting their collective derrieres . Do n't like what happens when you Drill , Baby , Drill ? Have to throw a punch at the administration that 's mopping up after your miserable attempt at governance . Do n't talk to me about Obama . YOU are to blame for the Gulf disaster , for the Wall Street debacle -LRB- `` Let the market decide '' you all proudly parroted . I hold the GOP voters and Bush Cheney responsible for putting their faith in corporations who do n't care about anything but their bottom line , and are so powerful that they OWN enough of Congress to stop or water down any reforms decent people try to make . Jimmy Carter gets another bump from the worst President ever spot as Obama continues to entrench himself as the most clueless , biggest liar , biggest electoral mistake of a president ever perpetrated upon this United States . Relief in 2012 from the insanity and lies . And some of them would secretly be working with shadowy Russian masterminds to plot his assassination or removal from power under the 25th amendment , or something . And the oil spill would have been caused on purpose as part of some diabolical scheme by corrupt businessmen looking to make a ridiculous amount of money in a foolhardy gamble that ends with them being killed by the shadowy Russian masterminds after they have outlived their usefulness . Anyway , my point , I think , is that if Obama is surrounded by sycophants , it ai n't anything like `` 24 . '' On other columns and blogs experts willing to sign their names are claiming pretty much exactly that , and quote laws to back it . Me , I 'm just an observer . I can see lots of reasons to be unhappy with Obama and his administration , I just ca n't see that any particular thing he did was so obviously wrong at the time as to be obvious at the time . Else where in these same columns and blogs other experts , willing to be identified , are pointing out that from the first minutes of the disaster , in response to an extent emergency plan , the Feds and the oil Industry have been following the current disaster plan . Currently there are so many ROCVs working the site that it is getting hard to work . While we have been commenting , the people who know how to spread the very best butter have been spreading it in quantity . That may not be the best solution , but apparently it is the current written plan , from which score all the choirs sing . When the time to review comes , we may assume that that score will be revised in light of lessons learned . Perhaps when that revision is done we can best serve by reminding the feds and Big Oil to keep revising that score BEFORE we have to do it from lessons learned . Obama 's team has FAILED to protect the MOST IMPORTANT ESTUARIES in the Western Hemisphere ! This incompetence equals that of the W administration ! I am going to the FL Keys to volunteer this weekend BECAUSE Obama is in charge and will clearly be unable to protect the Keys when the oil goes there - and it will ! This is going to prove to be the worse environmental disaster ever to hit this poor , old , abused planet . Only a NUCLEAR DISASTER would be worse . Are we supposed to trust them to manage more nuclear power plants ? That 's large government at work for you ... red tape stopping things that can be done and should be done from getting done . '' Let 's assume that the very moment the rig began to blow up , Obama had signed the waiver and Jindahl began his artificial reef . Three or four years from now the first parts of Jindahl 's Island would begin to pop up above the waves , and in ten years perhaps ten miles of barrier island might be ready . So it is obviously a terrible tragedy that Obama has wasted these verymany weeks in not letting Bobby J have his science fiction fantasy . Now , as to that island , want to try to guess its effects on everything from potential damages to beaches in Mississippi , Alabama , Florida , Cuba , Haiti , the Dominican Republic , Puerto Rico ... ? Building a string of barrier islands at the fifteen fathom line might be an excellent idea for a lot of reasons , but before we really screw things up we just might want to consider its effect on the whole Gulf region . But Bobby the dreamer has a Republicans response to complicated problems , just do something pretty stupid and then blame someone else when it does n't work . no bigger LIAR than BO ! In charge , he did n't even know that the MMS person had quit !! Posted by : morphy | May 27 , 2010 6:00 PM | Report abuse `` Obammy stop blaming every President - be a MAN for a change ! BP gave YOU millions in campaign money , no wonder you do n't push on them ... '' Obama 's donations from Oil companies : $ 800K McCain 's donations from oil companies : $ 2.7 mil Right , Obama was big oil 's man ... . It is not possible to leave them responsible , but that is a long discussion . The Official Deepwater Horizon Unified Command website is the administration 's decision making record . It conflates the company and the administration in a way I have never seen before . Exxon did not make Prince William Sound whole and neither will BP make the Gulf as it was . It is not in their power . Obama , like everyone else , is only now starting to realize this disaster is not only bigger , in terms of the oil in the water , it will have far worse consequences than Exxon Valdez . But even if he did decide to let BP twist in the wind of blame for political\\/economic purposes , it was the wrong thing to do , in my opinion . There is not a common sense comment from the lot of you . You would n't know how to stop a water leak in your parent 's home . But you know how to jabber wing nut b.s. Why do n't you go down there and volunteer your vast amount of internet surfing time to assist in clean up efforts ? No , I guess that would n't be your thing - ca n't download porn and work at the same time , right ? BP lied to the Feds , and the public . '' Yes and it is still happening . Why did Obama fail to understand he needed non-oil industry dependent biological oceanography experts and engineers to take charge of many if not most of the early decisions ? He had no idea . He is surrounded by political sycophants , like an episode of 24 . A book or three will be written on the early days of this disaster and how BP stayed in charge of every decision that mattered . When is the media going to start exposing these vile hate-filled people for what they really are ? Of course , this morning the pictures of the work going on on the surface were so crowded by work vessels that there was flatly NO camera angle that would hide the combined efforts of about everybody who could possibly make a contribution to the solution without mostly getting in the way and adding to the problem . Sort of interesting how nobody took the time to research just how extensive the response effort was . Easier to just blame Obama for not parting the sea and walking out there and laying on his hands and curing the well . History is going to find that Obama , the cool head when all about were losing theirs , was rather effective in getting all the parts to work together . AND , because he left BP in charge , he leaves BP as financially responsible as it is possible to leave them . He ALSO uses this disaster , not of his creation , to bring needed control to out of control wildcatting in deep water in the Gulf . Cool , calm , collected , efficient and effective . Change we can believe in . If this is Obama 's government at work , just imagine the diaster ahead in the government managed health care . Now , by Obama 's own words , the anti business liberals including the press have only their aspiring dictator Obama to blame for the lack of progress in stopping the flow of oil into the Gulf . Obama is beginning to admit his incompetence and failure as a president and diplomat . Democrat liberals called Bush every name in the book and all but accused him of personally arranging Hurricane Katrina . Now they 're defending an administration that has taken its own sweet time time reponding to this oil spill . I eagerly await the congressional\\/Justice Dept. investigation into BP 's financial ties to Obama 's election and the pass they seem to have gotton on some safety matters . I wonder if Chris Cillizza thinks 37thand0 is an embarrassment to Georgetown ? Does n't matter though . Democracy is a noisy mess and politics is a contact sport . We ca n't wait for November . It could n't be that he actually felt the need for another big lie . When will this country wake up to the fact that the community organizer is a farce ? This whole speech was to point out that he is and has been doing whatever is possible since it first happened . He would n't have had to give this speech had not so many cried `` This is Obama 's Katrina '' - which is wrong on so many levels !!

Obviously , oil leases will have to be revised to allow immediate Federal control of the well and all assets when and if such disaster should ever occur again . I will agree that where the Feds failed is in controlling the spill itself . There should have been super tankers there in a week bottling up the spill , and pumping in the oil and water . Could the Feds have ordered that ? Could they have seized BPs private property and commandeered the ships to the Gulf ? Would they in fact have done that had BP not misrepresented the magnitude and scope of the flow ?

This is why I miss Howard Dean . the personal appeal that his daughter asks him about the oil leak was priceless ... how he tried to blame the prior administration without naming them ... every time he took responsibility he made sure you knew it was n't his fault but someone elses . I did really like his one phrase where he stated that history would judge him and his response . . that was a very `` Bush-like '' answer Over all his performance was lacking today . He looked uncomfortable and unsure how to answer some questions so he ignored them . . like how about using the same technology the Saudi 's used on a similar spill with tankers . President Obama feels the pain of the people in the Gulf States . The President and his team have been directing and managing the oil crisis from Day one ! The fact , that the oil leak has not been blocked is nothing at all to do with the speed and persistence of President Obama 's response , but everything to do with the technical difficulties of blocking an oil spill at such depth ! how we missed Red Adair ! President Obama and his team are not trained to stop oil leaks ! That 's BP 's job ! We must not blame the President for something that is outside his control ! NO OBAMA 'S HIGHEST PRIORITY WAS SMEARING THE REPUBLICANS ON THE WALL STREET BILL . Come on - can he get serious ? NO OBAMA 'S HIGHEST PRIORITY WAS SMEARING THE REPUBLICANS ON THE WALL STREET BILL . Come on - can he get serious ? Who is the subject matter expert here and who has the years of experience , the equipment , and the personnel to deal with deep water issues ??? Instead of being bossy and trying to score political points in the press ... how about acting as a partner that is eager\\/willing to help facilitate the needs to stop the leak and prevent further disaster ?? Posted by : alutz08 | May 27 , 2010 5:13 PM | Report abuse And , of course , Obama offered ample evidence of exactly HOW the government has been in charge , right ? Obama is the hypno-toad . We simply absorb and believe everything he says without asking for any substantiation . It must be difficult to ask tough questions while basking in the glow of his light . In one comment you insist that the entire press conference was a waste of time because the media did nothing but lob `` gotcha '' questions ... at the president they 're infatuated with . I know people can buy boxes of stupid at WalMart ; maybe you can find a box of brains somewhere . Where did the DNC find this guy ? Did he actually pass the bar somewhere ? I vote we fire the DNC . We could have run someone really Presidential like Martin Sheen . Better yet , let 's draft Alan Grayson . I guess the only consolation is that the guy with Alzheimer 's and the Arctic Pom Pom Girl did n't get elected . Ca n't you just see that play out , `` Aw come on guys . Do n't be mad . I thought the red button was for warm milk and cookies . Maybe no one will notice what happened to London . '' Yet Obama feels its his right to reverse direction on that voluntary policy , play golf while oil seeps into the gulf ... play in Hawaii while troops fight and a hijacker attempts to bring down a plane on Christmas Day , and refuses to , as the ` Ragin Cajun ' put it best , `` Get down here and get in the middle of the situation . '' In 37 days , Obama has only visited once , and is begrudgingly going once more because his poll numbers have dropped . Instead of threatening a `` boot on the neck of BP , '' maybe he should be throwing as much resources that the Federal Govt\\/Military has to the use of BP to help speed up the closing of the leak . Talk about a lack of leadership . Whoever said that the GOP is against big gov ' t only when they 're not got it exactly right . Three miles out - that 's the Feds territory - hence the reason Jindal ca n't protect his coastline without a waiver - that Obama could sign in a heartbeat - is n't Obama the one who stated that now he was President that the `` oceans would heal '' ?

The leak probably could 've been severed within a couple days if you can get to it faster . The aspect of this crisis that President Obama could have controlled is the response to the danger of oil coming ashore , and he did not take control . He could have commandeered ships , boats , dredges , etc. and prevented the oil from coming ashore , but he did n't . He did marshal an army of lawyers to make sure BP is held accountable as any good Harvard Law grad would . But he did n't take command and provide the resources to prevent the damage to the coast of Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states even though he had more than 30 days before the oil actually came ashore . Not a shining moment . you know , like over at the SEC . when the slacker in chief takes a long vacation after five weeks of inaction , it is hard not to have that trickle down to the troops . All I can say is 2012 ca n't get here fast enough . Like some of the other claims he made -LRB- the government is doing as much as possible -RRB- this stinks of more BS rhetoric that sounds greater than it really is . Much like the economy and financial reg reform , the white house has cooked up this false reality that they did what was necessary and all is saved . To anyone who 's been paying attention this is obviously not the case . More importantly , this will be a field day for both dems , repubs , liberals , conservatives , and media pundits in terms of what this means politically versus discussing the effectiveness of the energy plan , questioning the notion of drilling for oil , questioning the need for more oil , raising the cap limits on the liability of damages of BP , etc. . This like many other important points of policy making will be drowned out in the media so the real back door negotiations can take place and further drive this country into the mess and decay it already lives in . ?? Our military , law enforcement , and ELECTED OFFICIALS need to HONOR THEIR OATH TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION !!! Posted by : dan_kempf | May 27 , 2010 4:38 PM | Report abuse Posted by : bsimon1 | May 27 , 2010 4:33 PM | Report abuse It 's hilarious that the new GOP spin is that regulation pushed BP farther out and this is what caused the disaster . As if drilling closer to the shore would n't simply have caused the massive amounts of oil to come ashore sooner . Republicans are n't this dumb , are they ? -LRB- a democrat -RRB- had no emergency planning when a Category 5 hurricane hit the shore of a city that starts out under water and in that situation it was the sitting President s fault -LRB- a republican -RRB- . Do you not see the irony in your statement ? How partisan can you get . Either Obama is at fault for not doing enough for this one of a kind oil spill or Bush was not at fault for a one of a kind hurricane . I tend to think both are not at fault simply because of the enormity of the event . I think if Hurricane Katrina hit during Obama s watch the same thing would have happen as did with Bush -LRB- minus all the learning s since Katrina -RRB- . Is democracy just about who can yell the loudest and the quickest ? These spammers -LRB- whatever their job may be -RRB- may have valid opinions but I honestly want to read some real diversity . When is the media going to start exposing these vile hate-filled people for what they really are ? The private sector will ALWAYS recklessly disregard safety for profit . Republicans are against big government except when they are n't . It was not my first idea but this is ridiculous . His measured response is a non-starter . I do not care about photo ops , but do want a radical reinvention and his presence there would perhaps prompt this . I think he is in a bubble , as W was . So , break out . He could stay out of the way in a military base , or on a military ship . It would not impede anything , and might help . His lack of awareness of his own personnel changes was disturbing in this time of crisis . He needs a wakeup call from someone other than his little girl . All hands on deck , literally . p.s. is there no pertinent expertise elsewhere in the world - the far northern European underwater rigs , etc. . SOMEONE must have a clue . Maybe another nation mandated an emergency plan that we lack , and we could access this ? Is chucking hair , mud and chopped tires as , uh , good as it gets ? What if they fail , and pressure pops open a bigger chasm ? AND they are prosecuting Blago for basically doing the same thing . Initially he tried to demogougue the situation , planning on the country to rally behind his socialist agenda . When it turned out that he had chosen badly and was on the wrong side , he tried to pivot . for someone who has been calling for big government oversight of everything on the face of the earth , his blame first , ask questions later fake did not fly . now he was caught simultaneously blaming others while still claiming he was in charge . the confusion did not change today . He does not even seem to know who works for him on a day to day basis . the personnel he sent to AZ are prohibited from enforcing the law . Hire a bunch of people to do nothing . his oil spill experts are paid to think about things and not act . sounds like Messiah himself , does n't it ? Who knows , maybe they are just using more viscous `` mud '' now . I got news for you dopes , Comrade Obama and his administration have been in charge since day one -- 36 or so days ago -- because the Feds have control of all areas outside the USA 's three-mile limit . Within the three-mile limit , the states are in charge because of the Stafford Act . The Stafford Act made it illegal for the Feds to respond to any disaster , unless asked to by the individual states affected . This is the reason George W. Bush did n't respond right away after the Katrina Hurricane disaster hit New Orleans and Louisiana . He would have violated the Stafford Act . Comrade Obama was in charge of the BP oil spill alright , and we 've all seen the result . That is what Obama was doing - instead of working on the oil spill . Allegations that the White House offered Joe Sestak a job in exchange for dropping out of the Pennsylvania Senate race echo an earlier report of a job offer to candidate Andrew Romanoff in Colorado . On September 27 , 2009 the Denver Post reported that the Obama administration offered Senate candidate Romanoff a position if he canceled plans to run for the Democratic nomination against incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet . The paper said the job offer , which specified particular jobs , was reportedly delivered by Jim Messina , Obama 's deputy chief of staff . One position cited by the Post was a job at USAID , the foreign aid agency . Messina contacted Romanoff soon after news leaked in August 2009 that Romanoff , former Colorado House speaker , would make a primary run against Bennet . This wo n't matter to progs , who find the Chicago style corruption of the Democrat party kind of cute . Charlie Rangel is still in office although temporarily not chairing the committee that writes tax laws , after all . And Barney Frank is still chairing the banking committee . And the only reason Eric Massa is gone is because he was going to vote the wrong way on ObamaCare . We do n't need another axis of evil speech , ever . No one chooses their own nickname from a TV show and then insists everyone use it . I remember when kids tried that in middle school and sometimes even in high school . The laughter , the mortification , it never worked . Have some self-respect Piyush , do the paperwork , talk to the magistrate like everyone else who had to change a name they hated . Do n't just call yourself `` Bobby '' , become Bobby . A team of lawyers will be crafting a reply to that question to studiously avoid having to say anything that could be used in court later . therefore we are all going to refrain from mentioning this standard Chicago practice anymore . I thought the GOP was all about smaller gov ` t , the power of the individual , and letting corporations do their own thing . Not when it comes to scoring cheap political points , I guess . Obama JUST GOT BACK FROM A FUNDRAISING TRIP TO CALIFORNIA . this is the cheapest form of manipulation from the fraud we elected . Allowing the fiction to persist until today that this thing was a fraction of its actual size was a nuanced decision ? It was either sink the oil with detergent or walk away from the whole thing ? Whaddya mean he no choice ? ATTENTION POTUS : AVOID THE PERILS OF A ` NATIONAL EMERGENCY ' RESPONSE Mr. President , in the next few days , a mounting chorus of fair-weather friends and knowing foes will press you to militarize the oil spill response . Please think carefully before you sign off on draconian measures that may result in a restriction of constitutional rights -- fomenting opposition to your leadership . And get that fleet of tanker-skimmers on the water , STAT . Maybe he does n't really have another choice , but President Obama should know better than to think voters will understand nuance . How exactly will that help the situation , short of providing photo-ops ? Obama is not an oil man , and the government does n't own any of the equipment needed for this process . People need to think about the actual practicality of the situation , rather than just drawing impulsive conclusions based on the administration 's media presence . I do n't expect berry to repeat answering hard questions for another full year . time for a vacation . An hour of work every 6 or 8 months , needed or not , is enough . now where 's my jet , my chef and my doctor , I gotta go . A really great leader would have even had the oil company pay for it . This is the kind of thing a state with off-shore drilling nearby needs to prepare for . People are going to be more frustrated after it stops . The frustration is only beginning . But people like greatgran are fools . The American people who elected the oil men Bush\\/Cheney are responsible for this disaster , right along with BP\\/Haliburton . You people who hate government , you Piyush Jindal fans , YOU did this . That said , Obama was and is responsible for the response . Leaving BP in charge of the most important decisions and the sequence of those decisions relative to the response was a bad decision . The long term is the only term for a problem like this , ask people who live in Prince William Sound whether Exxon made good , whether they are all done being frustrated . SO first let 's take control of BP and Halliburton assets and use their money not taxpayers money to solve the problem , pay for the clean up and provide necessary compensation for all of the people affected by the mess hitting the coast . Let 's freeze the assets of these businesses and make sure no big bonuses go the CEO 's and make sure the small businesses suffering on the coast get compensation so they can survive and prosper . Obama only delivers hot air and shocking as it is , blamed the Bush administration . Can you believe that ? He is shameless and of course blameless . He proves he is no leader . Jindal is my hero out there walking the walk trying to do all he can while that worthless `` o '' plays golf and goes to fundraisers . I hope the citizens of these southern states start to see these worthless '' know nothing do nothing '' Democrats for what they really are , worthless . This is their version of big government and that is to benefit while you suffer and all of us pay the tab . There is \\* no \\* place for even reasoned , respectful dissent with this President ? You are in favor of what he does or you are misinformed . This reminds me of the healthcare debate , where you either agreed with The One or you were misinformed . He campaigned that way as well - remember the straw man arguments he would pose at town halls : present his position and then say `` or maybe you think we should do nothing '' or `` we ca n't just stand still '' although there was -LRB- were -RRB- opposing views . Nobody proposed we should stand still , or do nothing , about the economy , or healthcare . It was a preposterous fib from The One and a cheap rhetorical stunt . Arrogant to continue to primly opine that yours is literally the only possible stance in any given situation . It 's a gussied-up version of `` my way or highway . '' There 's a party line , hew to it or just shut up . Thanks , but no thanks . I think we need all points of view and we need a President who is non-defensive in the face of critique . I wish we had one . My administration will prepare a statement . Now I have some Bball to play . Instead of opening with an update on the urgent top-kill procedure , Mr. Obama circled the wagons and went on the defensive . And for good reason , since the media questions were one big game of ` gotcha . ' After the same question was asked in seven different ways , the president finally said that he is responsible . Not one question was asked about mitigating the long-term environmental and economic consequences of the spill . No one thought to bring up our teetering economy , or the additional $ 145 billion bailout just announced . Nope , this was all about Mr. Obama , and the media 's infatuation with him . What a waste of time ... Posted by : mtpeaks | May 27 , 2010 3:07 PM | Report abuse I knew we were in trouble when Obama made it clear in an interview last year that the first priority of a politician is to get re-elected . And unfortunately this is the way he governs . Rather than act as the Chief Executive of his branch of government , he acts like the leader of the Democratic party and as such he isolates those who are not democrat allowing his ideaology to guide his thoughts and actions . This oil spill is his presidency in a microcosm - implement a series of half-measures , look to gain opportunistic political advantage , demonize another party and practice symbolism over substance . His ideology and arrogance trumped the moral and ethical response which should have been to mobilize all the necessary resources to minimize the environmental and financial impact of this disaster . Instead he immediatley sought political cover . I guess it boils down to one word ... leadership . A quality he obviosly lacks . HOMELAND HIT LIST TARGETS ` DISSIDENTS , ' ` UNDESIRABLES ' FOR SILENT MICROWAVE TORTURE , FINANCIAL SABOTAGE , VIGILANTE COMMUNITY STALKING HARASSMENT : VETERAN JOURNALIST Has POTUS been a target of cell tower - based microwave radio frequency weapon system -- deployed nationwide ? we have heard enough about his worry , his urgency and his concern . it all feels very 30,000-feet high , looking way down . why is there no czar ? why have BP US assets not been frozen , against future claims and equal to liability ? why have labor dept. people not been with the fisherman , and helping them fend off BP lawyers with $ 5,000 hush money checks . Bobby Jindal is looking better every day . Who 'd thunk it ? The One needs to get there and stay there , and leave a deputy with a brain in charge . no more press statements about impatience . that was old a month ago . When he is getting spanked by Carville , it 's bad . The McCain\\/Palin campaign received approx . three times as much as Obama 's . Perhaps you were n't around in 2008 , but Drill Baby Drill chants were heard in Minneapolis , not Denver . And he had to play the sympathy card with little Mashika .

Posted by : Jimbo77 | May 27 , 2010 2:38 PM | Report abuse i didnt think it was his best . not knowing about if the head of mms was fired or resigned ? he didnt seem comfortable up there . Are you saying that Obama learns everything through second hand sources ? No , the opposite . I am saying he was a part of the process of setting up her sacrifice , to be announced prior to his press conference . This has been a way for high priests and rulers to help their constituents feel better about the pain and anger associated with disasters that have or may befall them . Obama did not `` find out '' about this lady getting fired . When bad things happen , someone falls on their sword , or a witch hunt occurs and someone has to be burned at the stake . This is part of ruling a mob . Too bad for Birnbaum , she is no more responsible for dead turtles washing up in the weeds than you or I , but she is being treated that way , as if her firing will help the healing process .

BP Plc launched an ambitious deep sea operation to choke off a gushing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday , but President Barack Obama cautioned Americans there was no guarantee it would work . -LRB- Reuters -RRB- Thoughts , comments , suggestions or criticisms about The Post 's Live Q&A s ? Send us an e-mail . Thursday , May 27 , 2010 ; 1:00 PM The top kill is underway , success uncertain . BP engineers are pumping mud at a furious rate into the damaged blowout preventer that sits on the uncapped well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . The hazardous-but-high-reward maneuver comes five weeks into the oil spill crisis amid an intensifying atmosphere of political recrimination that has spread from the Gulf Coast to the White House and Congress . Greg McCormack : Hi I am Greg McCormack , Director of the Petroleum Extension Service the University of Texas we are following the activities in the Gulf of Mexico and I am here to explain the Top Kill Operation . Silver Spring , Md. : Soaking up oil : Whenever I am changing my oil in my car I make certain that I have a bucket of sawdust around -LRB- I am a woodworker -RRB- . When I knock over the old oil from my car , I just throw a few scoops of sawdust on it . It is immediately soaked up the oil and then I scoop it up with a dust pan -- problem resolved . There are millions of cubic yards of sawdust available from lumber mills , furniture makers , etc. . Has anybody suggested this . If interested , I can demonstrate or just try it yourself . This oil\\/sawdust could be disposed of by incinerating or easily hauled away . Denver , Colo. : I 'm trying to understand the logic behind the complaints that BP is n't doing enough . This is such a major PR disaster for them -- their name is going to be associated with Oil Spill for decades to come , like Exxon . What possible business reason would there be for them not to be doing everything possible to stop the leak and clean stuff up ? Baltimore , Md. : I find it a bit amusing that once it was announced that the `` top kill '' had worked , all the live camera feeds that a multitude of Web sites were showing live , suddenly ceased . At least I ca n't find one anywhere to save my soul . So what is this : some `` conspiracy '' to divert attention from what could be an incomplete success , or just a stupid media mindset of `` no drama ? Nothing to see here , move along , folks ... '' ???? Greg McCormack : There are multiple web sites showing the live feed . Because it is streaming they occasionally go down or stop showing the video . Downingtown , Pa. : I 'm unclear on how extensive the cement plug will be . Will it extend from near the sea floor to deep below ? Or will it be at the base of the drill casing and extend upward ? Perhaps a related question : How significant is the risk that hydrocarbons will bypass the plug and find a way to the sea floor ? Newport Beach , Calif. : Why are U.S. deep water drillers not required to drill a relief well at the same time the drill the initial well ? I understand this is a requirement in other countries including Canada . Would n't that have prevented much of this disaster ? Bowie , Md. : Without human intervention , what will ultimately happen to the oil that 's been spilled ? Will it eventually evaporate ; dissolve ; sink to the bottom ? Laurel , Md. : The United Kingdom produces a lot of petroleum from the North Sea . Is it BP doing that , too ? If their environmental practices are consistent , is that region at as much risk as our Gulf ? Arlington , Va. : It sounds to me like BP is just grasping at straws . They want to appear to be doing something , but they really know that the oil is going to continue to flow for several more months until the alternate well is drilled . Rockville , Md. : Our popular image of a land-based oil well is that it starts with a gusher spraying out the top of a rig . How are offshore wells initially dug in order not to leak in the first place ? Brooklyn , N.Y. : One thing I have never understood about the spill is that it is apparently an ` exploratory ' well . It seems to be an awful lot of oil for a non-production well . Did they just hit too much oil that had more pressure than the well could handle ? If this were a full production well that had ruptured how much worse would the disaster be ? Arlington , Va. : In the news you often read that the cement would plug the well `` permanently . '' How permanent is `` permanently '' ? Wo n't the cement crack and deteriorate over time just like with any structure ? Are there any long-range estimates of how long this plug is designed to last ? Washington , D.C. : What do you think about President Obama 's halt to offshore drilling for six months ? Does offshore drilling have a future ? If not , where do we get the oil ? Arlington , Va. : What happened to 4-story cofferdam they tried lowering over the leak originally ? Is it going to be left on the seafloor or did they raise it back up and recover it ? Palo Alto , Calif. : A little technical information is always interesting , and your guesses would be nice if you lack the actual data : What was the pressure at the wellhead prior to the start of the top kill , what pressure might have been imposed by the kill mud pumping , and what flow rates down hole might have been achieved in the first hour , and then say at hour 12 ? Centreville , Va. : Mr. McCormack , it has been widely reported that for the northern drilling Canada does require a relief well be drilled simultaneously with the production well . The reason this is n't going to cause a 2nd blowout is that the relief well taps into the original well drill hole and plugs it . The relief well does n't actually drill into the oil reservoir . Willis , Mont. : Why are n't they using a compound like drylock fastplug ? It will solidify under water . Metairie , La. : Why would BP , realizing this is an unprecedented disaster with an unprecedented need , not go outside of their company to have a national summit -- to confer with the top engineers of the country -LRB- even competitors like Chevron , Shell , etc. -RRB- to help solve this issue and work for the good of the whole industry ? Washington , D.C. : Hi Greg , my question is could this attempt to plug the well with mud have been done at the start ? I do n't know whether it 's true , but I 've heard that BP avoided it because they wanted to have the well available to them again in the future and did n't want to lose a moneymaker , so they tried other ways first . In that case , they 've been looking out for their interests instead of the country 's , and that 's when the government should have forced them to action on this earlier . Your thoughts on that ? Houston , Tex. : If the professionals do not know to fix this , why do people think blaming Obama will help ? Does the president have some skills here beyond what the pros have ? Hook 'em : The technical challenges that BP are faced with today have never been faced with before . Panama City , Fla. : I 'm curious about what we see continuing to escape the riser ? It does not appear as black as before but the volume of gas would seem to have increased , if it is in fact gas -LRB- Methane -RRB- Washington , dc : If the mud and cement plug is successful , is there a chance that it could produce pressure build-up elsewhere in the well 's pipes , causing other leaks ? Richmond , Va. : It looks as if pumping this heavy mud into the well is resulting in a substantial reduction in the amount of oil flowing from the leak -LRB- s -RRB- . If this is the case why not just keep injecting the heavy mud into the well to keep the oil out of the water ? Is n't the mud non-toxic ? Washington , D.C. : If a major hurricane were to hit the Gulf this hurricane season , how would that affect the oil that has already spilled ? I 'd imagine that it would aid in its devastating spread . Katy , Tex. : Seems to me nobody on the rig was watching the flowback of mud into the tank when swapping it out with Seawater . When this is all said and done , how is the interaction between service companies and producers going to be affected ? I see more service requirements , but with greater oversight from the oil companies , and this time hopefully with a competent `` Company Man . '' Rockville , Md. : Can you recommend a book with a chapter about the technical side of offshore drilling , suitable for an informed citizen to understand ? Exton , Pa. : Is there a technical reason not to immediately proceed with the junk shot if the top shot seems to be gaining ground on the blowout ? Omaha , Neb. : Is freezing anything an option ? Could it help with the current efforts at all ? Rockville , Md. : I work as a safety professional , so my job is to always examine worst case scenarios . Can BP really say with a straight face that they , and virtually every other oil company on the planet , never thought a blowout preventer could fail in this manner ? Just reading the few details about the incident , this seems like a 0.01 percent possibility , and certainly something worth investing some time and money into thinking about preventing or at least coming up with an efficient response plan . I just can not believe engineers have been flying by the seat of their pants on this response and that NOBODY ever considered that something like this could happen and came up with a way to fix it . Rutherford , N.J. : How wide is the opening of hole on the ocean floor and does it get bigger or smaller towards the surface . Also , does oil in most wells rise due to pressure or pumped to the surface ? Anonymous : Can the well be plugged using conventional weaponry such as torpedo ? Flower Mound Texas : Why did BP representatives , over strenuous objections of the crew on board , decide to replace the drilling mud that held the gas down in the well ? Is n't that heavy mud supposed to be there all the time ? What was it replaced with ? Cleveland , Ohio : I realize BP does not want to raise expectations . But given that it has now been almost 24 hours , about how long should we expect to wait before hearing that the flow has been stopped ?

Chantilly , Va. : Why is the oil still gushing out after more than a month ? I always assumed they need pumps and other equipment to get the oil to the surface . Where is the pressure coming from to continue to let the oil out of the well ? Sarasota , Fla. : BP has not been clear about the quantity of mud versus oil coming out of their gushing pipe . There seems to be uncertainly interpreting the video . But could n't they determine the relative quantities from a quick , simple analysis of the fluid they are pumping to the surface ? -- College Park , Md. : Why ca n't we use explosives to collapse the leaking well ? Anonymous : Why is difficult to recreate enough pressure to push the oil back down into the reservoir via the top kill . Presumably , when they pumped out the mud and replaced it with sea water , there was a situation where the mud 's weight was enough , why is n't it enough now ? The first question is a great to open the forum . I 'd like to follow up that question with the question . What is the pipe 's , that is currently broken at the sea floor , capacity for non-flow pressure along its walls , i.e. what 's preventing the current capping effort from causing the pipe to blow out underground given the pressure is so great ? St. Croix , USVI : In order to extract oil from the earth -LRB- whether beneath the sea or above -RRB- do n't you need to have a pumping mechanism in place ? Once this well was opened , does it mean it could just pour oil until resources were diminished ? Could a natural disaster like an earthquake cause the same type of oil leak beneath the sea ? Baseball : Wikipedia says you have switched your allegiance from the Mariners to the Nats ? I noticed that there 's an ad on this page for 10 cents off per gallon at Shell .

Ashton , Md. : Sorry to be off-topic , but my kids and I are wondering if you 'll ever do more episodes of Bill Nye the Science Guy ?

Washington , D.C. : I 've heard a lot about proposed chemical dispersants , but I 'm not sure what effect they will have in mitigating any damage . -LRB- When I add soap to a sink of oily water , the oil does n't disappear . -RRB- What do you think the immediate benefits of dispersants are ? Do the benefits outweigh the drawbacks ? D.C. : Why is the procedure called a `` top kill ? '' Huntsville , Ala. : My comment -- after 30 yrs + in thermoset polyurethane experience I think the leakage may be stopped by pumping a highly reactive chemical system either polyurea -LRB- example truck bed spray -RRB- or polyurethane -LRB- example skateboard wheels -RRB- into the pipe . Either system cld be catalyzed to react almost instantly at the temperature and pressure in that pipe . Augusta , Ga. : Any projections about the how toxic this oil is to the green things in the Gulf ? -LRB- The oceans phytoplankton produce 90 percent of the world 's oxygen and deserve consideration for their work for us and the sustaining diversity we need . -RRB- McMinnville , Ore. : This does n't pertain to the leak itself , but about the use of dispersants . Is n't crude oil anionic ? Why not use a cationic substance to bind the oil ? I work in the wine industry , and we use bentonite clay to bind layby proteins for clarification in white wines . Louisville , Ky. : I did just tweet this . There is a video suggesting the use of hay or straw to sop up -LRB- not stop -RRB- the oil spill .

Michigan : First , thank you Bill Nye , for making science fun and interesting to so many youths . Second , after just looking at the live feed , it certainly look like there is much oil still coming out with even more mud . Do you think this effort will work ? and do you think that they could make things worse ? A major collapse of the sea floor would do what to the oil underneath ? could n't we seal up the well with somethin more permanent than mud ? or are they trying to keep the options of redrilling this well later ?

Laurel , Md. : Charles Krauthammer writes today that offshore drilling has been forced into keep water by environmental regulations discouraging drilling in safer environments closer to shore .

The new figure supports what many observers have assumed from the images of oil slicking the gulf surface , slathering beaches and spurting from a pipe on the sea floor : This is the worst oil spill in U.S. history . President Obama , feeling pressure to act in a crisis now in its sixth week , yanked the exploratory drilling permits for 33 deepwater rigs in the gulf and suspended planned exploration in two areas off the coast of Alaska . He announced the moves at a news conference carried on cable TV channels that simultaneously showed the live video feed of effluent billowing from the cracked riser pipe at the bottom of the gulf . Obama pushed back on suggestions that , as he put it , `` BP is off running around doing whatever it wants and nobody is minding the store . '' He said that his administration is doing all it can , but that , when it comes to plugging the leak , `` the federal government does not possess superior technology to BP . '' The eventful day included the first prominent administrative casualty of the crisis . Elizabeth Birnbaum , head of Minerals Management Service , which issues permits for offshore drilling , resigned . The political developments continue to be overshadowed by a technological struggle that has no precedent . Whether the top kill is going to work remains highly uncertain . The maneuver is a brute-force , yet delicately calibrated , injection of heavy drilling mud into the blowout preventer atop the wellhead . As the mud is pumped from ships at the surface , the hydrocarbons should be forced back down the well toward their source in a porous reservoir called the Macondo field , about 21\\/2 miles below the floor of the gulf . It has not been smooth sailing . After pumping mud for about nine hours on Wednesday , BP put the pumping on hold throughout the day Thursday while it pondered the initial results . The company resumed Thursday evening . `` Nothing has gone wrong or unanticipated , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , told reporters . He said engineers hope to improve on their initial performance by preceding a mud injection with a blast of rubber balls and other rough-textured materials -- a `` junk shot '' -- to clog the blowout preventer and force more mud down into the hole , rather than shooting it out of the leaks in the riser . `` We did believe we did pump some mud down the well bore . We obviously pumped a lot of mud out the riser , '' Suttles said . BP Managing Director Bob Dudley likened the top kill to an `` arm-wrestling match with two fairly equal-rated forces . Or taking two fire hoses and driving them together , trying to overcome the other . '' The well wo n't be considered killed until the mud injection has been followed by cement to permanently plug it -- at which point the news would be carried by `` the roar coming out of this building , '' the deadpan Suttles said . News , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

BP is coming in for plenty of abuse these days , and certainly much of it is deserved . Mistakes made by BP officials , or contractors and suppliers they engaged and supervised , led to a preventable explosion that killed 11 people and unleashed an environmental disaster of immense but still unknown proportion . Compounding those initial mistakes has been a failure to anticipate such a disaster and have an adequate response plan in place . It is now clear that the ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico has been badly damaged , perhaps irreparably , affecting the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the region . The future of offshore oil drilling is now in question , with implications not only for the rest of the oil and gas industry but also for energy prices and energy policies here and around the world . So extensive is the damage , and so great are its potential liabilities , that BP 's very existence is now at stake -- a company that until a few weeks ago was posting annual profits of $ 14 billion with a market valuation in excess of $ 180 billion . As corporate screw-ups go , it just does n't get any bigger than this one -- and the damn hole still is n't plugged . My purpose today , however , is not to bury BP but to praise it . When confronted with such crises , corporate executives instinctively head for the bunker , withhold information , deny responsibility and drag their feet on efforts to clean up the mess they 've created . That 's a natural human reaction , particularly when people have died , jobs are on the line , the stock price is plummeting and the whole thing is playing out 24\\/7 on cable television . This bunker mentality is further encouraged by the army of lawyers who inevitably show up on the scene , whose sole concern is preventing criminal sanctions and reducing civil damages . But to their credit , rather than respond in ways you would expect them to , BP and its executives have generally responded in ways you 'd want them to . From the start , the company has declared that it is ultimately responsible for what happened and responsible for making things right , waiving any liability limits it might be entitled to under federal law . The company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , moved from London to the gulf , personally overseeing operations , visiting with government officials and conducting regular news interviews where his contrition seemed genuine .

Friday , May 28 , 2010 ; 4:37 PM A day after scientists reported finding a huge `` plume '' of oil extending miles east of the leaking BP well , on Friday a Louisiana scientist said his crew had located another vast plume of oily globs , miles in the opposite direction . James H. Cowan Jr. , a professor at Louisiana State University , said his crew on Wednesday found a plume of oil in a section of the gulf 75 miles northwest of the source of the leak . Cowan said that his crew sent a remotely controlled submarine into the water , and found it full of oily globules , from the size of a thumbnail to the size of a golf ball . Unlike the plume found east of the leak -- in which the oil was so dissolved that contaminated water appeared clear -- Cowan said the oil at this site was so thick that it covered the lights on the submarine . `` It almost looks like big wet snowflakes , but they 're brown and black and oily , '' Cowan said . The submarine returned to the surface entirely black , he said . Cowan said that the submarine traveled about 400 feet down , close to the sea floor , and found oil all the way down . Trying to find the edges of the plume , he said the submarine traveled miles from side to side . `` We really never found either end of it , '' he said . He said he did not know how wide the plume actually was , or how far it stretched away to the west . He said the plume was found in an area that had already been closed to fishing by the federal government . Cowan 's finding underscores concerns about oil moving under the surface , perhaps because of dispersant chemicals that have broken it up into smaller globules . BP officials have played down the possibility of undersea oil plumes . This discovery seems to confirm the fears of some scientists that -- because of the depth of the leak and the heavy use of chemical `` dispersants '' -- this spill was behaving differently than others . Instead of floating on top of the water , it may be moving beneath it . That would be troubling because it could mean the oil would slip past coastal defenses such as `` containment booms '' designed to stop it on the surface . Already , scientists and officials in Louisiana have reported finding thick oil washing ashore despite the presence of floating booms . It would also be a problem for hidden ecosystems deep under the gulf . There , scientists say , the oil could be absorbed by tiny animals and enter a food chain that builds to large , beloved sport-fish like red snapper . It might also glom on to deep-water coral formations , and cover the small animals that make up each piece of coral . `` You 're almost like a deer in the headlights when you 're watching this . You do n't know what to say , '' Cowan said . He said the oil 's threat to undersea ecosystems `` is really starting to scare us . '' In the discovery described Thursday , scientists aboard a University of South Florida research vessel found an area of dissolved oil east of the leak that is about six miles wide , and extends from the surface down to a depth of about 3,200 feet , said Professor David Hollander .

The announcement came in response to scattered reports of illnesses among cleanup workers and some residents , which has prompted criticism from members of Congress , local activist groups and independent scientists that not enough was being done . `` We 're very concerned about the impact of disaster on the public health of people in gulf region , '' said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , adding that she had sent a letter to BP Chairman Lamar McKay urging the company `` to take responsibility for the health consequences of the disaster . '' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring poison centers and other reporting systems for signs of any emerging medical problems , Sebelius said . The Environmental Protection Agency had tested more than 15,000 air samples from Venice , La. , to Pensacola , Fla. , and had not yet not yet detected dangerous substances at hazardous levels , she said . More than 500 water and soil samples had also been tested , she said . Nevertheless , the National Disaster Medical System has been activated to provide any needed additional medical care for the five gulf states , and a federal mobile medical unit was being sent to Louisiana to help assess anyone complaining of illness , Sebelius said . In the latest incident , seven workers were hospitalized Wednesday after complaining of nausea , dizziness and headaches , prompting the Coast Guard to order all 125 boats working in the Breton Sound area to return to port as a precaution . One worker remained hospitalized Friday , and an investigation was underway to try to determine the cause . At least one senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency has questioned the official reassurances , noting the dearth of monitoring data that has been released publicly . He likened the response to previous toxic waste disasters and the World Trade Center cleanup , which left workers with long-term respiratory problems despite repeated official claims that workers did not need respirators because the working conditions were safe . `` It 's unbelievable what 's going on . It 's like deja vu all over again , '' said Hugh Kaufman , a senior policy analyst at the EPA 's office of solid waste and emergency response said during an interview Thursday . `` There 's no way you can be working in that toxic soup with getting exposures . '' The reports of the illnesses have prompted members of Congress and local fishermen 's groups to call on BP to take more steps to protect workers , who are considered at greatest risk . One congressman has federal officials to set up temporary health clinics in the area . The situation is being complicated by the working and weather conditions , which include long hours in severe heat and humidity . That can cause symptoms similar to those triggered by some of the chemicals workers may be exposed to . Assessing the health risks is also complicated by several unknowns , including a lack of information about the makeup of chemicals being used to disperse the oil and how those substances might affect the toxicity of the oil , several experts said . The most worrisome chemicals are volatile organic compounds , such as benzene , which can cause cancer at high levels and long exposures . But those and other substances can cause acute symptoms including severe skin irritation , headaches , dizziness , nausea and burning eyes , as well as breathing problems and neurological complications including memory problems , confusion and disorientation . Most acute symptoms from the chemical exposure disappear after the exposure ends , but long-term complications can occur . Some fishermen involved in cleaning up the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska suffered long-lasting neurological problems . The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences designed a safety course in English , Spanish and Vietnamese that all cleanup workers are supposed to complete before they can begin work . They are also supposed to be equipped with protective gear , such as gloves and boots . Nevertheless , anecdotal reports have emerged of workers doing cleanup in street clothes and bare hands , raising questions . Some critics are calling for all workers to be equipped with respirators , a move officials said they have not taken because most do not appear to be being exposed to dangerous levels of fumes that would make that necessary . Respirators and heavy suits could pose risks in the heat and difficult working conditions , they said . The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health is gathering information about clean-up workers to track their health and document any problems that might emerge . The most worrisome substances in the oil that can become airborne are expected to have dissipated by the time most of the oil reaches shore , reducing the risk from dangerous fumes to residents along the coast . But they will still face risks from getting the thicker oil on their skin . And because so much of the oil is traveling underwater , exactly what form it will take when it emerges remains unknown . Over the long term , the oil could pose a risk to human health by getting into the food chain .

Many reasons , but this one goes unmentioned : Environmental chic has driven us out there . As production from the shallower Gulf of Mexico wells declines , we go deep -LRB- 1,000 feet and more -RRB- and ultra deep -LRB- 5,000 feet and more -RRB- , in part because environmentalists have succeeded in rendering the Pacific and nearly all the Atlantic coast off-limits to oil production . -LRB- President Obama 's tentative , selective opening of some Atlantic and offshore Alaska sites is now dead . -RRB- And of course , in the safest of all places , on land , we 've had a 30-year ban on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . So we go deep , ultra deep -- to such a technological frontier that no precedent exists for the April 20 blowout in the Gulf of Mexico . There will always be catastrophic oil spills . You make them as rare as humanly possible , but where would you rather have one : in the Gulf of Mexico , upon which thousands depend for their livelihood , or in the Arctic , where there are practically no people ? All spills seriously damage wildlife . That 's a given . But why have we pushed the drilling from the barren to the populated , from the remote wilderness to a center of fishing , shipping , tourism and recreation ? Not that the environmentalists are the only ones to blame . But it is odd that they 've escaped any mention at all . The other culprits are pretty obvious . It starts with BP , which seems not only to have had an amazing string of perfect-storm engineering lapses but no contingencies to deal with a catastrophic system failure . However , the railing against BP for its performance since the accident is harder to understand . I attribute no virtue to BP , just self-interest . What possible interest can it have to do anything but cap the well as quickly as possible ? Every day that oil is spilled means millions more in losses , cleanup and restitution . Federal officials who rage against BP would like to deflect attention from their own role in this disaster . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , whose department 's laxity in environmental permitting and safety oversight renders it among the many bearing responsibility , expresses outrage at BP 's inability to stop the leak , and even threatens to `` push them out of the way . '' `` To replace them with what ? '' asked the estimable , admirably candid Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander . No one has the assets and expertise of BP . The federal government can fight wars , conduct a census and hand out billions in earmarks , but it has not a clue how to cap a one-mile-deep out-of-control oil well . Obama did n't help much with his finger-pointing Rose Garden speech in which he denounced finger-pointing , then proceeded to blame everyone but himself . Even the grace note of admitting some federal responsibility turned sour when he reflexively added that these problems have been going on `` for a decade or more '' -- translation : Bush did it -- while , in contrast , his own interior secretary had worked diligently to solve the problem `` from the day he took office . '' Why had n't we heard a thing about this ? What about the September 2009 letter from Obama 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration accusing Interior 's Minerals Management Service of understating the `` risk and impacts '' of a major oil spill ? When you get a blowout 15 months into your administration , and your own Interior Department had given BP a `` categorical '' environmental exemption in April 2009 , the buck stops . In the end , speeches will make no difference . If BP can cap the well in time to prevent an absolute calamity in the gulf , the president will escape politically . If it does n't -- if the gusher is n't stopped before the relief wells are completed in August -- it will become Obama 's Katrina . That will be unfair , because Obama is no more responsible for the damage caused by this than Bush was for the damage caused by Katrina . But that 's the nature of American politics and its presidential cult of personality : We expect our presidents to play Superman . Helplessness , however undeniable , is no defense . Moreover , Obama has never been overly modest about his own powers . Two years ago next week , he declared that history will mark his ascent to the presidency as the moment when `` our planet began to heal '' and `` the rise of the oceans began to slow .

Now , 38 days after the Deepwater Horizon blowout that triggered the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , mounting attention is being paid to whether concerns about money created a sense of haste that -- even more than broken gadgets or buckling cement -- may have led to the disaster . Even before the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig went down in flames , BP 's ill-fated exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico 's underwater Mississippi Canyon had been consuming time and burning through money . BP had been drilling for six months , about twice as long as expected . And it was paying probably around $ 2 million a day -- half a million dollars a day just to lease the rig , and more for supplies and a bevy of top-drawer contractors such as Halliburton . The company had paid more than $ 5.2 million since January for drilling mud alone , according to a daily drilling report . Industry experts estimate that the total cost was nearing twice the $ 100 million typical for deepwater wells . `` Poking anything in the deep water , it 's above $ 100 million just for starters , and the meter keeps running , '' said Fadel Gheit , oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. `` For a tricky well , it could cost $ 150 million or $ 200 million . '' That price tag appears to have weighed heavily on the minds of rig workers on the Deepwater Horizon , according to interviews they have given to government investigators and publications including The Washington Post . `` There appears to have been a number of changes in the well plan during its construction , '' Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman -LRB- D-N.M. -RRB- said during a May 18 hearing . `` These decisions can be driven by cost and the desire to make up lost time in a drilling project . '' In a briefing Wednesday , BP investigators said company officials on the rig and in Houston decided to install only six of the 21 devices they had originally planned to use to make sure that the drill pipe was centered in the well hole . An off-center pipe can cause faults in the cement surrounding it , which could allow gas to shoot up the sides of the well . BP said that it did not do the other centralizer tests because the correct pieces of equipment were not available that night , and those on hand might have broken into pieces . It did not wait to obtain the optimal materials . Industry sources say that BP also told three workers from the oil services firm Schlumberger to go home without doing a key test of the sturdiness of the cement in the hole , something that would have taken several hours ; they left the rig 11 hours before the well blew up . Rig workers and lawmakers have faulted BP for failing to pay enough attention to a spike in pressure in the drill pipe and for neglecting to ask for a second cement plug in the well -- both of which could have been addressed with more time . Instead , rig workers have said , BP pressed for closing the well and moving the exploration rig off the site . -LRB- A separate platform would be built later to produce the oil . -RRB- BP says Transocean had primary responsibility for the rig 's safety . Transocean and other contractors blame decisions by BP .

'' She spent 10 days driving the Gulf Coast , trying to assess damage to both wildlife and ways of life . She wrote about it on her blog : Today as I sat in a boat in the Gulf , surrounded on all sides by oil-tainted seas , it 's hard to say what hit me the hardest . Was it the graceful and enigmatic dolphins surfacing through the slick ? Or Captain O'Neill pointing out the spots where he fishes for speckled trout , redfish , flounder , crab and shrimp , and hearing the desperation in his voice . Was it seeing first-hand the soup of oil droplets , dispersed but thick as Louisiana bean soup , as far down in the water column as one could see ? Or was it the overwhelming odor of petroleum that left me feeling slightly nauseous ? It 's hard to say . But the cumulative impact was heartbreak . Heartbreak because standing there on the boat , all I could feel was helplessness . `` Heartbreak , '' Nelson says , has `` turned into anger . How could we have allowed this to occur ? '' She cited the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil-spill disaster , which , by some estimates , took four years and $ 2.2 billion for Exxon to clean up , with some effects permanent . She monitors the live feed of BP 's `` top kill '' efforts to plug the oil , and puts in 10-plus-hour days on the newly formed `` swat team '' of nearly two dozen NRDC staffers now devoted to the disaster . Her anger sustains her through the long days . `` It has really spoken to the activist in me , '' she said . `` People have these watershed moments in life where your mission in life becomes crystallized and this was one of those crystallizing moments ... This is why I chose to become an environmentalist .

Below are contributions from Ed Rogers , Scott Keeter , Douglas E. Schoen and Donna Brazile . White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ; chairman of BGR Group So far there are no political winners from the gulf oil spill debacle . And there probably wo n't be any winners , just various degrees of losers . I was working at the White House during the Exxon Valdez spill , and I appreciate the challenges of many of the players . President Obama 's political managers are all being told that the president needs to `` do something . '' But when he does he becomes more closely associated with the ugly problem and more responsible for the nearly impossible task of stopping the flow and managing a cleanup that will leave most people unsatisfied . The governors of the affected states have to be busy and make demands of BP and the feds , yet they must not appear to be ineffective when not much happens . In Washington , among those with no real responsibility , there is a contest to see who can kick BP the hardest and promise the most restitution to all those affected by the spill . Ultimately , there will not be enough money to make everybody happy , much less quiet . So we are entering a political cycle of blame , promises and poor results , which leads to more blame and another layer of promises . All the while , the results of the spill get worse , and the pictures of the failure appear on every TV in America several times a day . Using contrived criminal and civil tools , Obama may decide that the death of BP is his best political cover ; governors will do what real work can be done and hope for the best ; Congress will no doubt commission a study , release a report and pass new laws whose effects , intended and unintended , are hard to imagine . This is a great American tragedy whose political consequences will linger for years . No one will emerge as a hero , savior or indispensable leader . Instead , the revelation of the limits of our technology , leaders , laws and energy options will leave us all frustrated and in a mood to blame everybody involved . Until now President Obama has avoided serious political damage from the government 's handling of the spill , but this may be changing . Recent polling finds pluralities or majorities of the public disapproving of the administration 's response or giving it low marks for its handling of the situation . Even among Democrats , ratings of the administration 's performance have been tepid . The spill is unfolding at a time of exceptionally low levels of trust in government , which may make the public even less forgiving . Still , unlike Hurricane Katrina , where the government had primary responsibility for dealing with the crisis , until now its role has been secondary to that of BP . And the public has been far more critical of BP for its handling of the crisis . Although the spill may cause Obama political damage in the short run , it could help him in the longer run with key legislative priorities for his administration : the passage of a comprehensive energy bill and efforts to address environmental protection more generally . The spill has spurred an increase in support for environmental protection , which had declined over the past two years as concerns about the economy pushed aside many other public priorities . While polling by Pew Research and other organizations continues to find at least plurality support for offshore oil drilling , the level of support is much lower than before the spill . With President Obama 's approval rating dropping to close to 45 percent , driven in large part by his handling of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the Obama presidency is facing a real crisis . And while it was certainly welcome news Thursday that the president took full responsibility for the situation , that will do little to stem the ever-increasing political fallout from both sides of the aisle -- from James Carville to Sarah Palin . The president has to stop seeking to both blame and distance himself from BP , all the while asserting federal authority and responsibility . He needs a fundamentally different approach . He has to make it clear that we are all in this together -- not as corporations or populists , not as Democrats or Republicans , but as Americans working to solve the problem collectively . This would be similar to how , in his National Defense Review , Obama spoke of the need for developing and enhancing alliances around the world to confront common enemies and solve common problems . He must emphasize results and outcomes -- not partisanship , populist bashing , or divide and conquer . This is how he ran his campaign , how he said he would govern and how he has to govern now . If he does n't rally Americans , no amount of rhetorical parsing or political gamesmanship will solve a problem that has the potential to undermine the credibility and perceived competence of the Obama presidency . Author and political commentator ; manager of Al Gore 's 2000 presidential campaign ; served on the Louisiana Recovery Authority from 2005 to 2008 Even if some good comes out of BP 's oil flood , it still looks like a lose-lose situation for everyone involved . Not only has the spill caused a substantial loss of marshland for the gulf and the livelihoods of residents , it will have lasting effects far into the future . Both Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- and President Obama may still emerge as political winners . Jindal may already have won as much as he can , politically . The perception had been that Jindal cared more for a national office than the governor 's mansion , but the perception has changed . His handling of this crisis has made him look competent , concerned and in charge . But since Louisiana must rely on the feds , Jindal is in a dilemma he ca n't control . Things are up to the president now . Jindal may claim he energized Washington , but winning big in his state may make Jindal less attractive nationally . To be a `` winner , '' Obama must accomplish , then publicize , the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Emphasize the flood and the plug -- that he fixed what BP 's greed and big oil 's conceit broke . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Change the regulatory culture , and not just at the Minerals Management Service . Make regulation effective at all agencies . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Take charge , make BP pay -- and make sure the public knows both . -LRB- 4 -RRB- Aggressively push for the progressive energy policy he campaigned on -- no more spill , baby , spill or mine , baby , mine . -LRB- 5 -RRB- Dam the flood and clean up the marsh . Prioritize the wetlands and the coast , promising restoration and restitution for both . Even more , turn `` Obama 's Katrina '' into a success story , by finally recompensing New Orleans and the region . Show how the federal government should work .

The attempted `` top kill '' of the well was abandoned late Saturday afternoon , leaving the huge Macondo field deep beneath the sea floor once again free to pump at least half a million gallons of crude a day into the gulf . `` I can say we tried . But what I can also say is this scares everybody , the fact that we ca n't make this well stop flowing , or have n't succeeded in that so far , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said in a late-day news conference . `` There 's no silver bullet to stop this leak , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . The top kill -- a term most Americans had never heard until it became part of the new national vocabulary along with `` blowout preventer , '' `` containment dome '' and `` junk shot '' -- had been seen as the best hope for turning the oil spill into something finite in volume . Now BP must fall back on a containment strategy in the near term , hoping to capture as much oil as possible . Sitting on the sea floor and awaiting deployment is a new containment dome , what the company calls the Lower Marine Riser Package cap . With robotic submarines , the company will sever the leaking , kinked riser pipe that emerges from the top of the blowout preventer , the five-story-tall contraption on top of the wellhead . Then engineers will guide the LMRP cap onto the pipe . The cap is fitted with a grommet designed to keep out seawater and prevent the formation of slushy methane hydrates that bedeviled an earlier containment dome effort . The cap procedure will take four to seven days , officials say . `` This operation should be able to capture most of the oil , '' Suttles said . `` I want to stress the word ` most , ' because it 's not a tight , mechanical seal . '' After that , the company could place another blowout preventer on top of the existing one . Meanwhile two drilling rigs at the surface continue to drill relief wells . That 's a long-term strategy that requires engineers to hit a seven-inch target , the bottom of the leaking well , 31\\/2 miles below the surface of the gulf . The first of the two relief wells to hit the target will send a massive dose of cement to seal the leaking well . That will not be until August , BP predicts . Saturday 's news was hardly a shock , given the doubts expressed by engineers and even by BP itself about whether it 's possible to kill a well 5,000 feet below the surface and accessible only with robotic vehicles . But the gulf was still hoping for good news . After BP executives began the top kill Wednesday , chief executive Tony Hayward said the effort was proceeding as planned . Then the national incident commander , Thad Allen , gave news media interviews Thursday and Friday suggesting that the effort was going well . As he put it , `` We 'll get this under control . '' The well had other ideas . It ceased to spew oil only when it was force-fed the drilling mud . When the pumping stopped , the well returned to form , churning out oil and gas . It was like hitting a Bozo punching dummy -- it goes down , then springs back up .

Holder Jr. to the Gulf Coast to meet with federal and state prosecutors . The Holder trip could signal that the environmental calamity might become the subject of a criminal investigation . Holder has said J ustice Department lawyers are examining whether there was any `` malfeasance '' related to the leaking oil well , and investigators , who have already been on the coast for a month , have sent letters to BP instructing the company to preserve internal records related to the spill . But federal officials indicated that Holder 's trip , which will include a news conference in New Orleans on Tuesday afternoon , will focus on enforcement of environmental laws and holding BP accountable . The opening of a criminal investigation or civil action against BP , if either were to happen , would create the unusual situation of the federal government weighing charges against a company that it is simultaneously depending on for the most critical elements of the response to the record oil spill . `` We 're cooperating fully with all inquiries , and we 're doing everything we need to do and more in terms of preserving records , '' BP spokesman Andrew Gowers said Monday . The relationship between the federal government and the oil company has been an awkward collaboration all along -- `` We have them by the neck , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said of BP in congressional testimony last week -- but it reached a turning point Monday when the administration said it no longer wants to share a podium with BP at the daily briefing in Louisiana . Instead , the national incident commander , Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , will give a solo briefing wherever he happens to be . The public relations shake-up comes in a tense period , with the Gulf Coast rattled by news that last week 's attempted `` top kill '' of the well did n't work . A government forecast shows the oil slick potentially striking the popular tourist beaches of Mississippi and Alabama later this week . The official arrival of hurricane season Tuesday has incited a new rash of dire scenarios . With bad news washing up everywhere , the administration has been desperate to convince the public that the government , and not the oil company , is fully in charge of the crisis and mounting a robust response . The administration and BP have disagreed over whether the company 's next maneuver would cause a temporary increase in the flow of oil into the gulf . In the coming days , BP plans to saw off the top of the leaking riser pipe where it emerges from the blowout preventer that sits on the well . BP will then lower a containment dome , or cap , onto the riser in an attempt to capture the leaking oil . White House official Carol M. Browner said Sunday that after the pipe is cut , about 20 percent more oil would probably escape before the new cap is in place . BP officials said that they think that is unlikely and that there might be no significant change in the flow . `` We 've been increasingly frustrated with BP on matters of transparency , '' an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Monday . `` We 're not going to stand there while BP says there 's not going to be any increase in flow rate when they cut the riser . '' Said Gowers : `` We 've been very clear about the likelihood of increased flow , and we 'll leave it at that . '' The seat-of-the-pants nature of BP 's effort to deal with the spill was driven home Monday night by the announcement of a new element of the latest containment strategy , this one using hoses deployed in the failed top kill maneuver to channel oil to a free-standing pipe and then onto surface ships . BP said the technique , which might not be ready until early July , would capture more oil and gas . Another change to the pipe near the surface would allow greater flexibility of operations during a hurricane . Hovering over such squabbles is the bigger question of whose hands are on the wheel of response to the crisis , which began with the April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 people . President Obama and his lieutenants have insisted that the government has full authority . Before BP attempted the top kill , for example , the federal government issued a statement saying it had given approval for the maneuver . Allen , the incident commander , has said that while BP is the `` responsible '' party , the federal government is `` accountable '' for the response and that there 's no meaningful way for the government to assume greater authority . But the daily news briefings have not always bolstered the government 's stature as the commanding authority in the crisis . The briefings have been held at the Unified Area Command headquarters in a Shell Oil training facility in the town of Robert , La. . The two principal briefers have been Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry and BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles . Landry tended to give relatively upbeat remarks on the progress of the response and the dedication of those involved . `` BP has brought a very , very good team , '' she said early in the crisis . She rarely delivered bad news . Saturday , after Suttles announced the crushing news that the top-kill effort had failed , Landry said she was disappointed , but she added , `` We also want to assure you we 've had a very , very aggressive response posture . '' Suttles typically delivered the most detailed , urgent news of the day involving the efforts to plug the leak . Reporters directed most of their questions to him . Now Landry has been rotated back to her position as 8th District commander `` in order to focus solely on coordinated federal hurricane response planning and preparation efforts in the Gulf of Mexico , '' a government spokesman said . The new on-scene coordinator at the command center is Rear Adm. James A. Watson . White House officials said Monday that no one was unhappy with Landry , only with the arrangement in which the government and BP shared a microphone .

As BP hacked away at a pipe gushing oil at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , investors sawed off 15 percent , or $ 21.1 billion , of the company 's market value Tuesday . Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. , during a trip to the Gulf Coast , announced that the Justice Department had launched criminal and civil investigations , adding to pessimism among BP investors reeling from the failed attempt to plug the leaking well over the weekend . BP , the world 's fourth-largest company before the April 20 blowout on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , has lost a staggering $ 74.4 billion , or 40 percent , of its market value in six weeks . Although investment analysts say the company has pockets deep enough to pay for mounting claims and cleanup costs , the political outcry for making BP pay has added to the uncertainty surrounding its future , especially while oil is still leaking into the Gulf of Mexico . President Obama vowed a `` full and vigorous accounting '' of the causes of the oil spill disaster in the gulf , telling the leaders of a new commission that they should pursue the trail of blame without limits . Separately , the Justice Department told a federal judge in Houston it opposed the request by Transocean , owner of the Deepwater rig , to limit its liability to $ 27 million under a 1851 maritime law . `` This is can not do , '' the department said in its filing . Calls for punishing BP intensified . Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said : `` BP should pay . Not just for the cleanup , but for the lives lost and the natural treasures destroyed . '' And on the Web site Talking Points Memo , former labor secretary Robert Reich urged Obama to put BP 's American operations into temporary receivership . Meanwhile , BP had begun yet another effort to deal with the spill , using a giant lobster-claw-like slicer to cut off the old damaged pipe that has been twisted on the seafloor . A saw then worked on the remaining section of the blowout preventer to make it easier to get a tight fit later this week if BP can successfully lower a new apparatus on top to funnel oil and gas to the surface . But the national incident commander , Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , did little to raise hopes of a quick end to the crisis , saying `` We 've got to keep our heads in the game ; we 've got to keep our shoulders to the wheel . '' The tense relationship between the Obama administration and BP took a more adversarial turn with Holder 's trip . He said that Justice was reviewing statutes such as the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which could carry penalties of $ 1,100 for every barrel of crude spilled into the gulf , or more if negligence is proved . Legal experts said it is likely that BP will face at least a civil federal lawsuit and is already in violation of environmental laws . In addition , criminal prosecutors are examining the possibility of false statements , obstruction of justice and conspiracy , federal law enforcement sources said , though they would not say whether evidence of such crimes has emerged . Legal experts said this means that investigators are exploring whether BP ignored warning signs before the explosion , falsified records or statements to regulators , or tampered with testing equipment . Holder did not specify BP as the target of investigation . Numerous contractors are involved with the Deepwater rig . The prospect of criminal charges , especially if filed against the corporation as well as individuals , could threaten BP 's leases with the Interior Department and weaken its position in claims negotiations . Criminal charges put the accounting firm Arthur Andersen out of business , but other companies that have been the subject of criminal probes have settled and paid fines . "}, {"uid": "800", "dct": "2010-06-02", "dates": [], "text": "The BP oil spill and religious environmental ethics Q : The catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a widening environmental , economic and political crisis . Is it also a moral crisis ? How does religion influence our use and abuse of the natural world ? Does religion help or harm the environment ? It is a matter of interpretation . Whether or not religious traditions influence us to use or abuse the natural world depends upon the meaning we choose to give to our texts and to our traditions . Whether or not religious logic has something useful to add to the conversation regarding environmental ethics depends upon whether or not we as human beings want to regard ourselves as outside or within nature . It depends upon whether or not we want to give nature intrinsic value , value in itself or instrumental value , value according to our ability to use it . I say : the tragedy of the BP oil spill is a moral crisis that is the result of human estrangement from the Divine , from each other and from nature . A holistic spiritual morality , an environmental ethics rooted in religion can help us find our way back to wholeness and to holiness . Environmental ethics says that one major reason for environmental degradation is anthropocentrism . This means that what is good for humanity is the primary ethical concern . Some place the blame for this on religion . Feminists say it is a function of male domination . Critical theorists say humanity has lost its enchantment with nature , that we no longer consider it sacred . Deep ecologists say that humankind has lost its sense of connectedness with the natural world , that we understand ourselves as atomistic individuals created and existing apart from nature . A different interpretation of religious texts and traditions can modulate the negative influence of anthropocentrism . The Bible teaches evolution . Genesis 1:26 says : `` Then God said , ` Let US make humankind in our own image , according to OUR likeness . '' -LRB- emphasis mine -RRB- Who is the `` us '' ? Some say God is speaking to the heavenly hosts depicted in I Kings , Isaiah and Job . However , there is no mention of the heavenly hosts in the creation stories . There is nothing for God to speak to as `` us '' at this point other than the natural world , including living creatures of every kind . Let us be generous and say that the `` us '' in the text refers to God , the heavenly hosts and the natural world . Thus , humankind is the creature made from both heaven and earth . Humankind is the link between God and nature . We are the divine animal . When we understand that the Bible teaches evolution , humanity is not a creature created outside of nature , but we are creatures of nature . We are ecological beings . This interpretation places humanity within a network of mutuality that not only includes human community , but includes the ecological community and communion with a transcendent God . Since humanity has intrinsic value and nature is a constitutive element of humankind , then nature also has intrinsic value . Nature is sacred because it is a creation of the same God that created humanity . Since humanity is the divine animal , it has an obligation to divinity that the rest of nature does not have . Religion , therefore , does its work of revelation , of revealing to us the ligature , the connective tissue that binds us to God , to each other and to the natural world . With this revelation comes moral obligation . Does humanity exist for the sake of nature ? Or does nature exist for the sake of humanity , thus having instrumental value ? I say the answer to both questions is yes . But what is the character of this human moral obligation ? Is it one of domination or care ? Again it is a matter of interpretation . Genesis 1:26 also says : `` And let them -LRB- humankind -RRB- have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the birds of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the wild animals of the earth , and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth . '' Dominion means control , sovereignty , to prevail against . It is a relationship of domination . Feminist thinkers have compared this domination to the domination of man over woman , that the earth , like woman , is considered feminine , passive , wild , unreasonable , and it ought to be tamed and made rational for the sake of the comfort of man . However , there is another Biblical creation story with a very different moral imperative . Genesis 2:15 says : `` The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to till it and keep it . '' Here the moral obligation of humanity to the natural world is one of care . To keep the garden means to guard , protect , attend to , be aware of , observe , preserve , reserve , regard , save and watch it . Human disobedience caused an estrangement from God and led to human exile from Eden . To return to God 's favor requires repentance , faith and a rededication to justice , and justice is a due regard for the well-being of the Other , including the non-human Other . The natural world is important in how God describes God 's blessings and curses to humankind . In the prophetic book of Ezekiel God gives prophetic pronouncements that show his blessings through the health and fecundity of the natural world and his curses through the felling of trees . The prophet speaks of showers of blessings , or trees that yield fruit and an earth that yields her increase . -LRB- Ezekiel 34:25 -RRB- . Of the proud cedar the prophet writes : `` Therefore thus says the Lord God : Because it towered high and set its top among the clouds , and its heart was proud of its height , I gave it into the hands of the prince of nations ; he has dealt with it as its wickedness deserves . I have cast it out . '' -LRB- Ezekiel 31 : 10-11 -RRB- The prophet gives a list of God 's grievances against the people : bloodshed , idolatry , contempt for parents , extortion of aliens , injustice to widows and orphans , sexual immorality , adultery , incest , bribery , usury , oppression of the poor and needy , priests who make no distinction between the holy and the common , between the clean and the unclean . The prophetic pronouncement establishes the connection between act and consequence : `` I have returned their conduct upon their heads , says the Lord God . '' -LRB- Ezekiel 22:31 -RRB- Ecological disaster is interwoven with other injustices . It results from a logic of ourselves as singular beings . We decide our morality based only on what we think is right for ourselves alone . -LRB- There is a virtue in selfishness , but that it another discussion . -RRB- We act out of a defective moral vision that says that our desires , needs , comfort , prosperity , hopes and dreams are the only important moral concerns . Such puts us in a state of estrangement with the divine , with human community and with nature . We fail to see that our individual selves are inextricably bound to Others , including nonhuman Others . Religion helps us to correct this vision . Just as it is a hermeneutical and theological error to interpret religious texts and traditions to separate humanity from nature , it is also a mistake to think that environmental ethics is separate from other political , social , economic moral concerns . In the case of BP and the tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico , it is important to see that we have made an idol of science and technology . We have assumed the capability to solve any engineering problem at any ocean depth . We have lost the necessary humility regarding what we know and what we can do . We have allowed our thirst for oil and the distance it allows us from each other to cause us to forget our moral obligations to be careful of its use . Moreover , we have made an idol of the government , thinking that if only we call in the military , if President Obama were more emotionally engaged , if only there were stronger regulations , more ships sent to the gulf to vacuum up the oil , if only there were more of this or that , the problem would be solved . We have made that which is not ultimate , the government , ultimate . This is a tragic disconnect from the divine , from each other and from the natural world . Religion calls us to wholeness . It calls us to relationality . Our holiness is our ability to see ourselves in the Other , to see the Other in ourselves and to see the sacredness of God 's entire creation . It is a matter of interpretation , but an interpretation that can bring us to a place of healing . Your 's is a well written post -- as good as any I have ever read on this site . I wish that a number of people would read and respond to it . I would edit slightly your second paragraph : the BP oil spill is a tragedy in that it is a terrible example of a much larger moral crisis -- that is , human estrangement from the Divine , from each other and from nature . I am always interested in what a scholar such as you has in mind by the term divine .

President Obama tried Wednesday to channel public outrage about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill into support for a climate-change bill , seeking to redefine an issue that threatens to tarnish his presidency . In a speech at Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Mellon University , Obama made one of his strongest pitches for comprehensive climate legislation , arguing that the case for breaking the nation 's addiction to fossil fuels has been made clearer by the environmental catastrophe in the gulf . The president vowed to gather votes for the climate bill in the `` coming months '' and repeated his intention to roll back billions of dollars in tax breaks for big oil companies , to tap natural gas reserves as an alternative to coal , and to increase reliance on nuclear power -- although energy experts said that such a program would leave the country just as dependent on offshore oil . `` I will make the case for a clean-energy future wherever I can , and I will work with anyone from either party to get this done . But we will get this done , '' Obama said . `` The next generation will not be held hostage to energy sources from the last century . '' Allies of the president have argued for weeks that the administration should stop talking about BP , the oil company responsible for the spill , and instead tap into the public attention to the catastrophe in hopes of giving it at least some redemptive value in the long term . `` The oil disaster adds new urgency and a new opportunity for connecting with the public , '' said Daniel J. Weiss of the Center for American Progress . `` The administration was going to do it anyway , but this gives it a new way to talk about it . '' Those urging action have sent White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel briefs that argue for a final push on the climate legislation , and others have had conversations with climate adviser Carol M. Browner and legislative director Phil Schiliro . In an online column posted Wednesday , Weiss and CAP President John D. Podesta argued that `` the horrible BP oil disaster has reminded Americans that we must reduce our oil use , '' adding : `` We share the view that this presents an unprecedented opportunity to take bold action to achieve this goal . '' Energy experts warned that climate legislation would have little impact on the need to search for oil in the Gulf of Mexico to meet U.S. demands . Offshore oil provides a growing portion of U.S. oil production , and deep-water wells account for a rising share of the offshore output . The gulf provides about 40 percent of U.S. oil production . Obama 's earlier mandate to improve automobile fuel efficiency will do much more than a climate bill to cut oil use , but even a sharp drop in U.S. consumption would leave the nation a net importer and thus dependent on offshore oil . The president made this point when he endorsed an expansion of offshore drilling weeks before a drilling rig exploded April 20 and triggered the spill . `` The president is correct that we need more -LRB- renewable energy -RRB- , but we need more oil , too , '' said J. Robinson West , chairman of PFC Energy , a Washington consulting firm . The leading supporters of climate-change legislation on Capitol Hill cheered Obama 's remarks as a clear step up from his rhetoric in recent months , when he often left unclear whether he was going to push for energy reform this year .

Thursday , June 3 , 2010 ; 3:26 PM BATON ROUGE -- For some people , a giant underwater oil leak is n't solely an environmental disaster . It 's also a delicious , once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for research . `` I was praying for a small oil spill and I ended up with this , '' said Sonia Gallegos , an oceanographer at the Naval Research Lab at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi . Last year Gallegos received funding from NASA to study spills . This year she received a terrible , awesome gift from BP , and -- like 100 other scientists gathered at Louisiana State University on Thursday -- is now playing mediator between the brain and the heart . `` I 'm very happy to have something to work with , but at the same time I live here , '' said Gallegos , who 's working on automated detection of oil spills . `` It breaks my heart . It 's my home , and I understand the impact on people . '' `` I live two blocks from the beach in Bay St. Louis -- we smell the benzine , '' said her lab colleague Allen Reed , a geologist . `` It 's an opportunity , but it 's very unwelcome in many ways . '' Early Thursday morning the scientists and federal officials wolfed down danishes , mini doughnuts and coffee before engaging in a day-long mind meld . Curiously , the summit took place in a campus building named after LSU alumnus Lodwrick M. Cook , former chairman and chief executive of ARCO , an oil company that was acquired by BP in 2000 . `` We 're here to find out what we know , what we do n't know and what we need to know , '' said Robert Gagosian , president of the District-based nonprofit Consortium for Ocean Leadership , which organized the event . What they know : The oil will be a matter of concern and study for generations . What they do n't know : Where exactly the oil is going , how much there is , and what exactly it will do to wildlife and industry . What they need to know : How to choreograph dozens of state , local and federal players , and how to harmonize streams of data into an accessible , coherent set that guides future action . From a dais in front of round , white-clothed tables , Jane Lubchenco , administrator of NOAA , updated the crowd on the federal response , which in the next two months will remain focused on both the movement and immediate impact of the oil from the Deepwater Horizon leak . Within six months , the government hopes to calculate the impact of dispersants , conduct seafood surveys and quantify the injury to natural resources . In the longer term , it plans to study the impact on and the possible restoration of ecosystems , as well as the socioeconomic fallout in coastal states . Lubchenco skipped through a PowerPoint presentation of charts with tiny numbers and swaths of color that depicted , by turns , the location of pre-impact assessment sites , the coordinates of data-gathering stations at sea and the forecast of surface oil movement over the next 72 hours . She also referenced the Interior Department 's pre-impact assessment along the coast , and a `` flow rate technical group '' that had been assembled to determine the volume of oil . The brisk rundown irked at least one scientist . `` The big problem is so far there 's no central database where we can actually get hold of '' this data , said Piers Chapman , head of the department of oceanography at Texas A&M University , during the question-and-answer session that followed . `` The public feels there is a conspiracy to hide data . '' `` It 's probably going to be a challenge to have all that available in one place , '' Lubchenco replied . `` We are working on a collaborative effort to put all data together -- a product most likely to emerge is a spatially explicit Google-driven map so you can find what 's where ... No one 's hiding anything . It 's a data management issue . '' But the passion to share research and knowledge -- one of the prime reasons everyone gathered in the Lod Cook Alumni Center -- should take a back seat to cleanup efforts , said Edward B. Overton , an LSU chemist and professor emeritus . `` There 's massive amounts of oil on the surface that is eminently skimmable , '' Overton said from the dais before attendees broke into smaller group discussions that were closed to the media . `` If there 's a skimmer in the world , it ought to be in the gulf today ... I 'm happy we 're studying it but we have to make sure we keep as much oil as possible off the shore . BP needs to stop the bloody well and the rest of the community needs to make sure that oil does not get to the shoreline .

The gargantuan blob of light Louisiana crude floating in the Gulf of Mexico has already closed oyster beds , shut down shrimpers , canceled fishing tournaments and panicked beach hoteliers from New Orleans to Key West . With the vast majority of the oil floating offshore , where it will land and whom it will affect have become a guessing game fraught with worry . Wherever the oil goes , it threatens to obliterate billions of dollars for the region 's tourism and fishing industries . `` It 's like waiting for a hurricane to hit , '' said Mike Voisin , owner of Motivatit Seafood , which harvests oysters from the gulf . `` We do n't know where it will go . Every day we look at the forecasting maps . '' `` We 're praying hard , '' said Ed Schroeder , director of the tourist bureau in Pensacola Bay , Fla. , where people are wishing away an oily sheen about 10 miles off the coast . A report of tarballs on the beach led the news in the local paper last week , though it is uncertain whether the tar came from the spill . `` If we were picking a time for something like this to hit , it would n't be now , '' Schroeder said . `` Our season just started . '' At stake are industries that employ tens of thousands of people and generate billions of dollars in economic activity for coastal areas stretching hundreds of miles . Beyond fishing and tourism , the offshore oil business is likely to feel the effects soon , too , as some exploration halts under a federal moratorium , analysts said , and new safety measures are required . `` It 's clearly going to make deep-water exploration more costly , '' said Edward Morse , a Credit Suisse oil analyst . `` My rough estimate is that it will have at most a 10 to 15 percent increase in costs developing crude from deep water . '' For gulf regions from Texas to Key West , commercial fishing contributes $ 1 billion to GDP , tourism and recreation contribute $ 13 billion , and oil and gas contribute $ 11 billion , according to figures from Charles Colgan of the National Ocean Economics Program . As the slick slides toward Mississippi , Alabama and Florida , the damage could spread . At the Mariah Jade Shrimp Company in Chauvin , La. , Kim and David Chauvin have watched as the closing of about a quarter of the gulf to fishing has made the flow of shellfish to their dock just a trickle . The company has three of its own shrimping vessels , which have been enlisted to help contain the spill . `` Our dock is pretty much closed , '' said Kim Chauvin , 42 . `` At this point , we are going to be looking for other jobs ...

The White House ordered BP to pay for construction of five more large sections of Louisiana barrier island sand berms Wednesday as efforts to contain the gushing Deepwater Horizon oil spill hit more obstacles and the slick approached Florida . BP announced later Wednesday that it supports the administration 's decision , and that the project will cost the company an estimated $ 360 million . That is double the amount it has spent so far in helping the region respond to the oil spill . `` The federal government and the state of Louisiana have agreed that the barrier islands construction is an effective response to the spill , and we look forward to working with them on this project , '' said Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive officer . `` There is no time for waiting , '' said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- after learning that the plan would go ahead . `` We are asking the Coast Guard and the federal government to force BP to act responsibly and immediately get to work on all the six segments that have now been approved as part of our oil spill-fighting efforts . '' The costly construction has been a high priority for Louisiana officials , but federal officials have worried about unintended environmental consequences , and BP has been less than eager to pay -- calling the buildup a `` hurricane relief project . '' The Army Corps of Engineers issued six permits in late May to build up about 50 of the 100 miles of barrier islands requested by Louisiana . Although the projects have received expedited environmental approval , the administration also needed to determine whether the work would actually stop oil from entering the marshlands , and to persuade BP to pay for it . Out in the Gulf of Mexico , BP has given up trying to stop the leak permanently until relief wells now being drilled reach it in August , and continued to struggle to contain it . On Wednesday , a diamond-tipped saw being used to cut a broken riser pipe and prepare it for a containment `` hat '' got stuck , and the cut could n't be completed . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the crisis , said the amount of oil contained by the stopgap covering will be determined to some extent by how fine a cut is made . Federal ocean specialists launched a research vessel Wednesday to determine whether large plumes of oil are floating beneath the surface , as some researchers have claimed and which BP has denied . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship Thomas Jefferson will travel around the gulf for 10 days to search for underwater oil . Tar balls and oil sheen from the huge slick reached Alabama 's Dauphin Island on Wednesday , as well as parts of Mississippi . The oil was also spotted less than 10 miles from the Florida Panhandle , further threatening the region 's vital seafood and tourism industries . The issue of how offshore oil projects should be reviewed was addressed Wednesday by the Interior Department . The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the department 's Minerals Management Service gave `` categorical exclusions '' from environmental review to eight offshore operations , including the Deepwater Horizon . Bob Abbey , the agency 's acting director , announced that `` before drilling new oil and gas wells on the Outer Continental Shelf , operators will be required to submit additional information about potential risks and safety considerations in their plans for exploration or development . '' He said exploration and development plans previously approved by the agency using `` categorical exclusions '' would have to be resubmitted .

NEW ORLEANS -- At first , it seemed that a British company might be trying to keep an American journalist off an American beach . Ted Jackson , a staff photographer for the Times-Picayune , drove two hours to Port Fourchon , La. , to shoot photos of tar balls on public property but was stopped 100 yards from the surf by harbor police . After 30 minutes of phone calls to higher authorities , Jackson said , the police allowed him 15 minutes of obstructed photographing , out of view of workers who were taking samples from the beach . Last week , Jackson was also unable to book a flight over Grand Isle from a charter plane company in Belle Chasse , La. , because the owner could not obtain permission from BP 's command center to enter restricted airspace . BP , the Federal Aviation Administration and the Coast Guard were refusing access to planes carrying media , according to Southern Seaplane 's secretary-treasurer , Rhonda Panepinto , who fired off a three-page letter to Sen. David Vitter -LRB- R-La . -RRB- `` We strongly feel that the reason for this massive -LRB- temporary flight restriction -RRB- is that BP wants to control their exposure to the press , '' she wrote . `` We are all at the mercy of BP , a British-owned company . '' This week , things got better . The FAA sent two special operations managers to the Gulf Coast on Tuesday to oversee flight access , according to Panepinto , whose company flew Jackson around Chandeleur and Ship islands on Wednesday and is fielding requests from other media outlets , with no grief from authorities . `` It 's almost like there 's a new sheriff in town , '' Jackson said . Perhaps the gulf operation is smoothing itself out after a month and a half of oil gush and media crush . Authorities had weathered criticism for a series of minor run-ins that gave the impression that BP was calling the shots . Last week a Mother Jones reporter was told she could n't see Elmer 's Island without being accompanied by a BP representative , because it 's `` BP 's oil . '' Two weeks ago Coast Guard officials cited `` BP 's rules '' when demanding that a CBS News crew leave a beach area . -LRB- Representatives from CNN , ABC and local CBS affiliate WWL-TV in New Orleans said last week that their journalists had not encountered significant obstacles while covering the oil story . -RRB- `` Neither BP nor the U.S. Coast Guard , who are responding to the spill , have any rules in place that would prohibit media access to impacted areas and we were disappointed to hear of this incident , '' said Rob Wyman , a lieutenant commander for the Coast Guard , in a statement responding to the CBS episode . `` In fact , media has been actively embedded and allowed to cover response efforts since this response began , with more than 400 embeds aboard boats and aircraft to date . '' On Saturday , a University of North Carolina energy blog titled Powering a Nation posted images of a BP contract that barred owners of vessels it chartered from making `` public statements . '' A BP spokesman said the company has standard contractual language designed to protect proprietary information , and that it has allowed media to cover its Vessels of Opportunity program , which employs local boat owners in cleanup efforts . The FAA responded to initial criticism over air traffic restriction by citing security concerns and asserting that BP employees and contractors were not involved in those decisions . Hundreds of media outlets are demanding access to a highly mutable , complex situation , and local , state and federal officials say they are working together -- under the majestic heading of Deepwater Horizon Unified Command -- to streamline the responses to both reporters and the public . `` With regards to media , we follow an incident command system , a tried-and-true way of responding to crises , '' said a spokesman for BP from the Unified Command 's headquarters in Robert , La. `` You have public information officers and you have a joint information center that includes the responsible party , BP , as well as government agencies who have involvement and oversight for this spill , the Coast Guard being the federal on-scene coordinator . We have state people , NOAA , representatives from Transocean -LRB- the company that owned the rig that created the spill -RRB- . We 've had MMS . What we do is use information that comes in through our operations and create , if you will , the message to share . '' That message , right now , is that the authorities want to provide access to the story while maintaining the proper safety parameters for both cleanup workers and the environment itself . But there might be more obstacles down the road if the situation intensifies , according to Chip Babcock , a trial lawyer specializing in media and First Amendment cases at the Houston legal firm Jackson Walker , which brought suit against FEMA when it blocked journalists from covering the removal of dead bodies in the weeks after Hurricane Katrina . `` There 's going to be , I think , a natural hesitancy to let journalists show images of the horrific scenes that are going to happen purely in the next few weeks , '' Babcock said . `` You 'll see these beaches clogged with oil , and animals suffering , and I think -- human nature being what it is -- there 's going to be some people who do n't want those images shown .

The outrage is directed at the President of the United States from people who do n't like him no matter what he says or does . The outrage from day one has been towards President Obama even when most Americans know that this had nothing to do with the President . People immediately gave cover to BP and they continue to do so by continuing to vilify President Obama and making this all about Obama . The media is guilty by perpetuating the outrage against the President . Is n't it interesting that people have been vilifying President Obama because of his outrage that BP is spending millions with commercials talking about how great BP is ? Read the comments from people blaming the President and vilifying everything he says or does regarding the oil spill . Notice what is missing ? Nothing being said about BP and what they have done or have n't done . Yep , where exactly is the outrage ? That BP , to save costs , as keeping the rig any longer in its present location was over budget , has potentially destroyed the livlyhoods of thousands of people . That because the project was already weeks beyond schedule , and was threatening the completion of another drilling project before hurricane season , BP inadvertantly destroyed much of the wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico and possibly beyond . None of this has anything to do with the quality of the people in charge at BP , nor does it accurately reflect the value that BP truly represents to humankind . BP must hire these people to help the public to see this sometimes not so obvious truth . I hope these PR people rot in hell .

Send us an e-mail . Friday , June 4 , 2010 ; 1:00 PM Synte Peacock : Hi , this is Synte Peacock from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. . I 'm one of the three collaborators on the computer simulations . It explains many of the details of what we have done . How bad can this get ? : In a worst-case scenario , how bad can this oil gush get ? What will happen if BP can NEVER get this fixed completely ? Oil keeps coming up . Currents move the water . Oil covers all of the Gulf and then moves up the East Coast . Then the currents take the oil to other continents . Eventually our entire ecosystem is ruined , starting with all the oceans of the world . People die because of a ruined ecosystem . Is this possible , or have I just read too many science fiction books ? Synte Peacock : How bad it will get will depend on the total amount of oil released . It 's unclear now how much this will be . Our results are formulated not to depend on this number . Instead , we report results in terms of a dilution factor . -LRB- see the NCAR URL for details : Ocean currents likely to carry oil along Atlantic coast -LRB- UCAR -RRB- -RRB- Worried about the Keys : I have gone to the Florida Keys many times with my family , from here in the D.C. area . We tow our small center-console boat down and enjoy boating , fishing , and scuba diving , keeping the boat docked at our hotel . I love the Keys . As you can imagine , I am now feeling very worried , sad , and anxious about what may happen to all the people down there , the reefs , and the fish , even though they are okay so far . How likely is it that the BP oil spill will damage this fun , beautiful , but delicate area , which includes the nation 's only underwater national park and a lot of protected coral reefs ? I know you do n't have a crystal ball but I do n't have any sense of the probabilities at this point . Synte Peacock : If and when the oil gets caught in the Loop Current , and fed to the Florida Current , it is possible that the Keys will be affected . But the impact on reefs and fish and coastlines will depend both on local winds and ocean currents -LRB- that we ca n't predict more than a few days into the future -- as others are trying to do -RRB- and of course on the total amount of oil released . Fairfax , Va. : People were saying on the news that some reports said the spill could reach Europe . How long would that take ? Florida coast : I have vacation plans on the Panhandle in two weeks -- do you think I should cancel\\/resked ? Washington , D.C. : Over time , will the damage the oil causes reduce itself ? In other words , will the oil become less dense , less thick and even out and not be such a danger to wildlife and the environment ? Have you seen the pictures of pelicans this morning ? It 's really disturbing . Synte Peacock : Our understanding that there will be significant dilution of the oil as time goes by , and this undoubtedly will help . How long it will take until the oil concentrations cease to be a danger to wildlife is something we do have an answer to at the moment . Arlington , Va. : The conservative take on the spill has been that the sun and the surf will break down the oil fairly quickly and this wo n't be a problem in a few months -- is that really the case ? Synte Peacock : What we 've shown with our simulations is that the currents can potentially move the oil very fast very fast , even out into the interior Atlantic within a few months . So if it does n't break down on this timescale , there could be widespread impacts . It would really help to have firm numbers on the timescale over which this oil can break down , but we do n't know that . Washington , D.C. : I do n't know if this is your area but let me ask . What 's keeping the oil coming ? Is there any chance it will stop on its own ? Where is all the pressure coming from ? And does n't the fact that it 's so far down in the ocean floor with so much water above pressing down , I ca n't imagine how much force the gushing has . Can you enlighten us ? Synte Peacock : This is a question for geologists . But you are right , it is internal pressures that are keeping it flowing . Washington , D.C. : Will the oil eventually rinse out of the water ? When you say `` over time , '' how much time would it take ? Crimping : Earlier this week , I think it was Bill Nye who mentioned that crimping and bending was n't a viable option . The metal pipe is too brittle and would crack into pieces rather than crimp together . Synte Peacock : Thanks very much ! Washington , D.C. : By rinse , I mean become diluted and therefore less harmful , poisonous . Synte Peacock : Yes , with time the oil will become more diluted . We have modeled the effects of dilution due to ocean currents and stirring , and our simulations show that the oil becomes significantly more diluted as it is transported further from the source . By the time the oil reaches the interior Atlantic in our simulations , we estimate that it will be roughly 2000 more dilute than it is at the source . Annandale , Va. : Can you explain how the tides affect the flow of oil ? Is the gulf pretty calm ? Is most of the oil staying there ? How much of a threat is there that it will spread worldwide or at least way beyond the Gulf ? Synte Peacock : We find that it is very likely that on a timescale of months -LRB- not years -RRB- , the oil will spread far beyond the Gulf . Note that it is likely to be much more dilute than it is at the spill site by the time it reaches the Atlantic . We have avoided trying to model near-shore processes such as tides and local winds because we do n't know what the winds will be weeks to months from now . San Diego , Calif. : They say they are now siphoning oil into tankers . How much will this impact the containment of the oil ? Or is this just a thumb in the `` Dutchman 's dike wall '' ? Synte Peacock : The more that is siphoned , the less will enter the Atlantic , and the less that has to be contained from hitting the coast . Bel Air , Md. : Can you basically explain the Loop Current in simple terms and how it will affect the spread of the oil spill ? Synte Peacock : Yes ! The Loop Current is part of the persistent ocean Western boundary current system -LRB- which includes the Gulf Stream -RRB- . But the Loop Current is unique because there is no coast between Yucatan and Florida , and so it forms a clockwise loop which protrudes into the Gulf . The Loop Current is quite chaotic and unpredictable . For example , sometimes it extends all the way up to Louisiana , sometimes it hovers far to the south , sometimes it pinches off a `` Loop eddy '' which travels west , and then grows again . McLean , Va : Could this impact the normal function of plate techtonics ? Silver Spring , Md. : Does your model take into account temperature fluctuations with depth and over the vast topography of the Gulf ? Do you consider the changing current patterns that will come as a result of changing seasons and temperatures ? Did you use the accepted macro and micro currents mapped by NOAA , or did you make generalizations ? Synte Peacock : Yes , our model has temperatures what vary with depth . We used an ocean model , and it was forced with `` typical '' weather conditions -LRB- no-one knows what the actual weather will be over the coming months -RRB- . We did n't use any previous assumptions about currents from NOAA or anyone else ; the model computes what the currents will be based on the physics , and on what the atmosphere is doing . Park Ridge , N.J. : Do you expect the oil to travel up the east coast ? If so , how far up the eastern seaboard could it reach ? Synte Peacock : I 'm going to have to sign out now .

Investors are eager for the crisis to be resolved . BP is a major player on the FTSE 100 , London 's main stock index , meaning that blows to its share price have significant effects on portfolios designed to track the index 's performance , such as certain pension funds and insurance policies . The National Association of Pension Funds estimates that BP shares represent 1.5 percent of the total assets of pension funds in the United Kingdom . Alan Smith , chief executive of Capital Asset Management , a London-based financial planning firm , said that `` pretty much every pension fund in the country owns BP shares , '' but up until recently , `` people looked at this as an environmental disaster rather than a man-on-the-street disaster . But now they are starting to think , ` This might affect me more than I think . ' '' Smith estimated that if BP were to lose half its market value , a Briton about to retire could reasonably expect a decline of up to 3 percent in annual pension payments . `` Those considering retirement in the next six months might be disappointed people when they realize the final amount of their retirement is less than hoped , '' he said . On Thursday , credit-rating agencies Fitch Ratings and Moody 's downgraded BP 's debt and said further downgrades could follow . Since the Deepwater Horizon oil well explosion , the company 's shares have fallen more than 30 percent . BP 's financial woes are also troubling for the British government , which is grappling with a ballooning deficit and could use a healthy tax return from the company to help replenish the public coffers . In a statement , BP said that last year it paid corporate income taxes of $ 6.3 billion , $ 1.1 billion of which went to Britain . In addition , the company said it expects to pay about $ 4 billion in 2009 production taxes globally , $ 200 million of which will go to Britain . While BP faces an uphill battle globally to restore its reputation during one of the worst environmental disasters in history , the climb seems less steep here , where the company is headquartered , is a flagship of the economy and has worked hard in the past decade to drive home an image of a green-friendly company . `` BP is a great British company , for long a byword for good management and successful performance on an international scale , '' the Express newspaper said in an editorial . `` It is depressing to see its name become synonymous with environmental disaster , at least for the foreseeable future . '' The Daily Mail said President Obama 's rebukes to BP resemble `` a judge who , having sentenced a penitent offender , demands again and again that he be brought up from the cells to receive another dressing down for the same crime . '' David Buik , an analyst at BGC Partners in London , said BP 's reputation in Britain had not plunged to the depths it has in the United States . `` No one blinks at the gas station when filling up -- BP , Shell , it does n't matter , '' he said . Shareholders , he said , had confidence in chief executive Tony Hayward 's management . `` To say the BP management is not doing all it can is not fair -- maybe it 's not enough , but they seem to be doing everything they can , '' Buik said . BP employs about 80,000 people worldwide , with slightly more than 10,000 in Britain . The employees in Britain are `` shocked and horrified , just like everyone else '' by the disaster , though few are taking seriously the swirling rumors of a takeover or breakup , Buik said .

The well has been capped , more or less . BP engineers Thursday night guided a containment dome onto the hydrocarbon geyser shooting from the Gulf of Mexico oil well -- a desperate and iffy attempt to capture the leaking oil and funnel it to a ship on the surface . It was not an elegant operation . Furious clouds of oil escaped the `` top hat . '' Late in the evening , officials with BP and the federal government had not yet announced whether the dome would be any more successful than other efforts in recent weeks . It was a day crammed with engineering drama . First , BP used robotic vehicles and a pair of giant shears to cut a damaged pipe a mile below the gulf 's surface . The result simplified the whole arrangement at the sea floor : Instead of spewing from multiple leaks in a tangle of bent pipes , the oil and natural gas surged in a single plume from what looked like a deep-sea smokestack . Then came the dome , lowered by cables , guided by robots , illuminated by lamps in a world without natural light , and carrying with it the hopes of countless engineers and pretty much the entire Gulf Coast . Nothing has gone according to plan in the subsea environment as , on the surface , the oil has hit more than 100 miles of Louisiana shoreline . After brushing a barrier island in Alabama , it is poised to tar the white sand beaches of the Florida Panhandle . The area of the gulf closed to fishing is now larger than the state of Florida . On Friday , President Obama will make his third trip to the region since the fatal April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and the resulting blowout far below . Although far from the only crisis of his presidency , the oil spill has been uniquely frustrating for Obama , whose power does not include technological leverage at the bottom of the gulf . Obama told CNN 's Larry King on Thursday that he is `` furious at this entire situation ... Somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions . '' Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , acknowledged in an interview published Thursday in the Financial Times that BP was n't prepared for a blowout of this magnitude . `` What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit , '' he said . The tool kits must be updated , said Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 's energy and environment subcommittee : `` From junk shots to top hats , this spill shows that BP and the oil industry paid more attention to drilling ultra-deep instead of creating ultra-safe technologies to prevent and respond to a crisis . '' Also Thursday , the Center for Public Integrity , a nonprofit investigative news organization , published an account of Coast Guard logs that indicated the Coast Guard knew within 24 hours of the explosion that the rig 's blowout preventer had failed and that the well could leak as much as 8,000 barrels a day . The center obtained the logs from Rep. Darrell Issa -LRB- R-Calif . -RRB- , who said in a statement , `` These documents raise new questions about whether the White House was slow to respond to an incident that was quickly recognized by the Coast Guard as a potentially catastrophic threat to the environment . '' Six weeks to the day after Deepwater Horizon sank , and five days after BP and the government gave up hope for killing the well with blasts of drilling mud , the top hat offered the best chance so far of capturing the leaking oil before it can pollute the gulf further . The deep-sea plumbing job made for compelling viewing for anyone with an engineering bent , especially now that BP , once stingy with video , has gone to wall-to-wall , multiple-camera coverage , putting the live feed from 12 cameras on its Web site . The video has shown an underwater ballet featuring a shipyard 's worth of hardware , including robotic vehicles , giant shears , a diamond-edge saw , pipes , hoses , tethers , heavy weights and the infamous blowout preventer that did not prevent the blowout . The submarines and their metallic , pincer-grip arms are joysticked via mile-long cables by technicians at the surface , who take orders from engineers in BP 's war room in Houston . The deep-sea procedure is delicate and sometimes herky-jerky . The first attempt to cut the pipe , with the diamond-wire saw , failed when the saw became stuck for 12 hours , pinched by the pipe . `` Anybody who 's ever used a saw knows that once in a while it will bind up , '' Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander , noted Wednesday . When the saw came free , it still could n't cut through the riser because of the loose , rattling drill pipe that is threaded inside and wobbling around , preventing a firm cut , Allen said . So BP engineers resorted to giant shears Thursday morning . The cut was highly irregular , but engineers went back with the circular saw , slicing off an attached box and smoothing the edges in preparation for the top hat . Allen said BP has at least five different caps with different configurations standing by for the containment maneuver . The first attempt at containment several weeks ago went awry because the large dome lowered over the main leak in the pipe had no mechanism for limiting the amount of water mixing with the oil and gas . The very cold water and gas combined to form slushy methane hydrates that clogged the dome and made it buoyant , so that it wanted to float away from the leak . That 's why so much attention has been paid to the cutting of the riser pipe and the creation of a good fit for the new containment cap . The better the seal , the less likelihood that methane hydrates will foil the containment . The government has estimated that the flow rate from the well could increase 20 percent with the bent pipe no longer partially constricting the oil and gas . Allen waved off suggestions that the federal government has lost faith in BP 's trustworthiness . He said BP had given him whatever he had asked for . `` When I ask for action , it is taken , '' Allen said . `` The fact of the matter is that we have to do this together . '' The administration is keeping close tabs on expenses . The Coast Guard sent BP a bill Thursday for $ 69 million -- $ 69,090,958.57 , to be exact -- giving it until July 1 to reimburse the government for military , National Guard and federal agency efforts to cope with the oil spill .

Obama warned BP officials Friday against `` nickel-and-diming '' the economic victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill even as the company spends billions of dollars to pay out dividends and millions for an ad campaign to burnish its image . The stern statement , reminiscent of last year 's presidential finger-wagging at big bonuses for bank executives , came as the company struggled with a cap on the leak at the seafloor and as local fishermen and small-business owners expressed fear to the president about the nearing oil slick . `` I want BP to be very clear they 've got moral and legal obligations here in the gulf for the damage that has been done , '' Obama said in brief remarks after meeting in New Orleans with top federal and state officials overseeing the gulf crisis . `` And what I do n't want to hear is , when they 're spending that kind of money on their shareholders and spending that kind of money on TV advertising , that they 're nickel-and-diming fisherman or small businesses here in the gulf who are having a hard time , '' the president said . Company officials said BP had successfully placed a cap over a pipe connected to the damaged well , and the national incident commander , Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , said the company was collecting as much as 1,000 barrels a day . But the area where the cap is attached continued to belch forth clouds of oil and gas , clearly visible on live video feeds . `` It 's not a perfect seal , so if there 's enough pressure , the oil can actually get through the rubber gasket and get out , '' Allen said . The White House has been fighting back aggressively against criticism that Obama has been too slow to respond and too personally aloof from the human tragedy unfolding along the Gulf Coast . In his third visit to the region since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , Obama sought to highlight the government 's control of the situation and to show empathy for the region 's victims . During his trip , officials announced he will meet at the White House next week with the families of the eleven men killed on the rig . At Camardelle 's Live Bait and Boiled Seafood in Grand Isle , La. , Obama met with an oyster fisherman , a marina owner , two store owners and a shrimper . They sat around a picnic table overlooking the water , two shrimping boats docked behind them . As Obama 's motorcade made its way to the meeting , families along the route held signs proclaiming `` HELP US ! '' and `` God Help us all . '' On one , Obama 's `` Hope '' poster had the words `` What now ? '' scrawled across his forehead . It was on behalf of that sentiment that the president appeared most animated , telling reporters that he had assigned officials to make sure BP is not being miserly with its support for the region . He said they will `` look over BP 's shoulder ... to make sure that claims are being processed quickly , fairly , and that BP is not lawyering up essentially when it comes to these claims . They say they want to make it right . That 's part of their advertising campaign . Well , we want them to make it right . '' Following Obama 's remarks , BP announced that the company would soon begin sending a second round of payments to Gulf Coast residents and business owners , bringing to $ 84 million the total amount the company has spent to offset lost income or profit .

Here , a French-speaking Indian tribe has lived for more than a century , isolated from a world that had proved itself unfriendly . But the oil found its refuge in a month and a day . Now , this tribe is feeling an especially sharp version of Louisiana 's despair . Its members worry that the oil will kill the marsh , and seethe at the idea that a bitter history now seems to be getting worse . `` They come in and take our land . Now , the oil 's taking over . It 's like it 's happening all over '' again , said Grace Welch , 26 , in a stilt-legged house across the street from the bayou . Across the plywood-floored living room , her father was fantasizing about killing Christopher Columbus . `` They shoulda hang him , '' said Sidney Verdin , 60 . He meant the native people who encountered Columbus , the first scout of the civilization that would eventually drill an oil well 5,000 feet under the ocean and then not know how to fix it when it broke . The Pointe-au-Chien tribe lives west of the Mississippi River mouth , more than 100 miles by water from the spot where the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank . Headed here from New Orleans , the road branches and narrows until it is two lanes hugging a cola-colored bayou where alligators hide . The tribe lives where the road ends . On Tuesday , in the shaded space under a house on stilts , chief Charles `` Chuckie '' Verdin -LRB- pronounced `` VUR-dan , '' a common name in the roughly 680-member tribe -RRB- , 53 , recounted watching the TV news when BP gave up its attempt to completely kill the leaking well . `` I just stayed there and looked at it , '' said the chief , a deeply tanned man wearing a camouflage T-shirt , as stray kittens played around his feet . `` Going through my head -LRB- was -RRB- , ` This is going to get a lot worse . ' '' The tribe is not recognized by the federal government , and its name is proof of its still-murky history : The tribe 's official name is French for `` Dog Point . '' But others nearby asserted that the right name was the more genteel Pointe-aux-Chenes , `` Point of Oaks , '' and that 's the name on the local school . In Cajun French , both names sound like `` Point ahw-shen . '' The tribe says it has lived in this region for more than a century , one of a group of tribes that escaped into the bayous as Manifest Destiny roared by . But , for a century now , the swamp has done a progressively worse job at keeping bad things away . In the early 1900s , Louisiana 's growing oil industry managed to gain control of tribal lands for drilling wells . And flood-control measures reduced the sediment deposits that kept the land above water : Homes and cemeteries were abandoned .

He knew , from years of research at the reef , that it probably was n't a rock at all . He stabbed it with his diving knife . His blade pulled up gunk . `` Sure enough , it was tar from the Ixtoc spill , '' Tunnell said . Twenty-three years earlier , in 1979 , an oil well named Ixtoc I had a blowout in 150 feet of water in the southern Gulf of Mexico . The Mexican national oil company Pemex tried to kill the well with drilling mud , and then with steel and lead balls dropped into the wellbore . It tried to contain the oil with a cap nicknamed The Sombrero . Finally , after 290 days , a relief well plugged the hole with cement and the spill came to an end -- but only after polluting the gulf with 138 million gallons of crude . That remains the worst accidental oil spill in history -- but the Deepwater Horizon blowout off the Louisiana coast is rapidly gaining on it . The spill has now been partially contained with the cap that BP engineers lowered onto the mile-deep geyser Thursday night . That means roughly a quarter to half of the flow is being piped to a surface ship , the national incident commander , Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , said Saturday . BP hopes to improve the rate captured in coming days . If official government estimates are correct , 23 million to 47 million gallons of oil have spewed so far . Ecosystems can survive and eventually recover from very large oil spills , even ones that are Ixtoc-sized . In most spills , the volatile compounds evaporate . The sun breaks down others . Some compounds are dissolved in water . Microbes consume the simpler , `` straight chain '' hydrocarbons -- and the warmer it is , the more they eat . The gulf spill has climate in its favor . Scientists agree : Horrible as the spill may be , it 's not going to turn the Gulf of Mexico into another Dead Sea . But neither is this ecological crisis going to be over anytime soon . The spill will have ripple effects far into the future , scientists warn . `` This spill will be lasting for years if not decades , '' said Doug Inkley , senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation . Some of the immediate effects of a spill are obvious -- witness the gut-wrenching images of soaked and suffocating seabirds in the gulf . But some types of ecological damage are hard to measure and can take years to document . Many of the creatures that die will sink to the bottom , making mortality estimates difficult . Damage to the reproduction rate of sea turtles may take years to play out . The Exxon Valdez spill of 11 million gallons killed as many as 700,000 sea birds and 5,000 sea otters initially , but even 21 years later , populations of sea otters in areas of Prince William Sound have n't recovered . The Pacific herring population collapsed after the spill for reasons that remain in dispute among scientists . Two intensely studied pods of killer whales in the sound suffered heavy losses in the spill and have struggled since . One of the two pods has no more reproductive females . It is doomed to extinction . `` It 's still sitting there , '' said Stan Rice , program manager for habitat studies at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 's Auke Bay Fisheries Lab . `` It 's still liquid , you can still smell it and touch it .

And lawyers in more than a hundred lawsuits want BP to pay billions of dollars in damages for harm done to people 's health , the environment and businesses . `` At this stage , it is impossible to predict the longer-term cost of environmental remediation , claims and litigation , but they will be sizable , '' BP chief executive Tony Hayward said in a conference call with investment analysts Friday . So would anyone in his right mind buy shares in this company ? Despite the fatal explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that triggered the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , 10 of the 14 leading investment analysts tracking BP have `` buy '' ratings on the company , including one who has upgraded his recommendation . The reason : BP is a colossus with more than 18 billion barrels of proven reserves , operations in more than 100 countries , oil production everywhere from Angola to Russia to Alaska and a new agreement in Iraq . Even after paying out its regularly quarterly dividends at a rate of $ 10.5 billion a year , BP will still have $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in cash flow , depending on the price of oil . And its relatively modest debt level means that it could also borrow money if necessary . `` So we 've got considerable firepower here to deal with the costs , any costs as they accrue , '' Byron Grote , BP 's chief financial officer said in the conference call . Many analysts think the staggering drop in the price of BP 's stock since the April 20 explosion has been too steep . Mark Gilman , an analyst with Benchmark , boosted his rating to `` buy back '' May 26 , saying that the reduction in BP 's market value since the spill began `` implies gross , pre-tax environmental claims and costs to be in the $ 80 billion to $ 110 billion range , which we believe to be unrealistically high . '' In an interview Thursday , he said , `` while we 're not prepared to make a cost estimate , we 're comfortable saying it 's not going to be in that magnitude . '' Most people , however , have n't been following Gilman 's advice . After he upgraded his rating , BP 's shares have plunged even further . Since the disaster , the stock has sunk 39 percent , erasing more than $ 70 billion of market value . -LRB- Other companies involved in the well have also tumbled , including rig-owner Transocean , with shares down 46 percent and service-provider Halliburton , down 33 percent . Lease partner Anadarko Petroleum 's shares are off 40 percent . -RRB- BP shareholders are nervous , and while the oil giant has the resources to survive such a crisis , estimates of the cost to the company keep rising . Credit Suisse on Thursday issued a report that clean-up costs could total $ 15 billion to $ 23 billion and that legal claims could drain $ 14 billion more from BP 's coffers . Raymond James & Associates this week nearly tripled its estimate of costs to $ 7.5 billion -- not including any criminal or civil liabilities . And the three leading ratings agencies -- Moody 's Investor Service , Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor 's -- lowered their credit ratings on BP 's debt . Pavel Molchanov , an analyst with Raymond James , downgraded the stock to market perform -- neither better nor worse than the market average -- April 29 , nine days after the accident , and does n't expect an improvement as long as the negative headlines and oil continue to flow from the gulf .

Setting aside terrorist attacks , where the element of surprise is part of the plan , that still leaves the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 , Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the global economic crisis that began in 2008 -LRB- and was aggravated by Greece 's recent financial collapse -RRB- and the earthquake in Haiti in January . In all these cases , observers recognized the existence of catastrophic risk but deemed it to be small . Many other risks like this are lying in wait , whether a lethal flu epidemic , widespread extinctions , nuclear accidents , abrupt global warming that causes a sudden and catastrophic rise in sea levels , or a collision with an asteroid . Why are we so ill prepared for these disasters ? It helps to consider an almost-forgotten case in which risks were identified , planned for and averted : the Y2K threat -LRB- or `` millennium bug '' -RRB- of 1999 . As the turn of the century approached , many feared that computers throughout the world would fail when the two-digit dates in their operating systems suddenly flipped from 99 to 00 . The risk of disaster probably was quite small , but the fact that it had a specific and known date made it irrational to postpone any remedies -- it was act now or not at all . Such certainty about timing is rare ; indeed , a key obstacle to taking preventive measures against unlikely disasters is precisely that they are unlikely to occur in the near future . Of course , if the consequences of the disaster would be very grave , the fact that the risk is low is hardly a good reason to ignore it . But there is a natural tendency to postpone preventive action against dangers that are likely to occur at some uncertain point in the future -LRB- `` sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof , '' as the Bible says -RRB- , especially if prevention is expensive , and especially because there is so much else to do in the here and now . Our tendency to procrastinate is aggravated by three additional circumstances : when fixing things after the fact seems like a feasible alternative to preventing disaster in the first place ; when the people responsible have a short time horizon ; and when the risk is uncertain in the sense that no objective probability can be attached to it . All these forces came together to permit the economic crisis , despite abundant warnings from reputable sources , including economists and financial journalists . Risky financial practices were highly profitable , and giving them up would have been costly to financial firms and their executives and shareholders . The Federal Reserve and most academic economists believed incorrectly that in the event of a crash , remedial measures -- such as cutting interest rates -- would be enough to jump-start the economy . Meanwhile , depending on how they were compensated , many financial executives had a limited horizon ; they were not worried about a collapse years down the road because they expected to be securely wealthy by then . Similarly , elected officials have short time horizons ; with the risk of a financial collapse believed to be low , and therefore a meltdown unlikely in the immediate future , they had little incentive to push for costly preventive measures . This in turn discouraged the appointed officials of the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies from taking such measures . `` We 've never had a decline in housing prices on a nationwide basis , '' Ben Bernanke , then chairman of President George W. Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers , said in 2005 . It happened the next year . Finally , with no reliable probability estimate of a financial collapse available , it seemed natural and perhaps even sensible to wait and see , hoping that with the passage of time , at least some of the uncertainty about risks to the economy would dissipate . The BP oil leak reveals a similar pattern , though not an identical one . One difference is that the companies involved must have known that in the event of an accident on a deepwater rig , prompt and effective remedies for an oil leak would be unlikely -- meaning that there was no reliable alternative to preventing an accident . But the risk of such an accident could not quantified , and it was believed to be low because there had n't been many serious accidents involved in deepwater drilling . -LRB- No one knew how low ; the claim by BP chief executive Tony Hayward that the chance of such an accident was `` one in a million '' was simply a shorthand way of saying that the company assumed the risk was very small . -RRB- But other forces were similar in the leak and the financial crisis . If deepwater oil drilling had been forbidden or greatly curtailed , the sacrifice of corporate profits and of consumer welfare -LRB- which is dependent on low gasoline prices -RRB- would have been great . The regulators who could have insisted on greater preventive efforts were afflicted with the usual short horizons of government officials . Elected representatives did not want to shut down deepwater drilling over an uncertain risk of a disastrous spill , and this reluctance doubtless influenced the response -LRB- or lack of it -RRB- of the civil servants who do the regulating . The horizon of the private actors was foreshortened as well . Stockholders often do n't worry about the risks taken by the firms in which they invest , because diversified stock holdings can help insulate them . Managers worry more , but they are not personally liable for the debts of the firms they oversee and , more important , the danger to their own livelihood posed by seemingly small threats is not enough to discourage risk-taking . It seems that no one has much incentive to adopt or even call for safeguards against low-probability , but potentially catastrophic , disasters .

He apparently speaks to Republicans through a spewing oil well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . Rep. Tom Cole -LRB- R-Okla . -RRB- delivered the startling revelation last week that the BP oil spill was caused not by a faulty blowout preventer but by the Almighty Himself . He explained the spill to an Oklahoma City radio station like this : '' Acts of God are acts of God . '' With this curious theology , Cole has joined the ministry of Texas Gov. Rick Perry , a fellow Republican , who last month said of the oil spill : `` From time to time there are going to be things that occur that are acts of God that can not be prevented . '' So if God is responsible for the spill , and BP is the spill 's `` responsible party , '' what these men are really saying is that BP is ... God ? This interpretation is at the very cutting edge of ecclesiastical thought . In the past , our Heavenly Father has involved himself in floods , droughts and the occasional earthquake , but this may be his first foray into industrial disasters . The Valdez spill was an act of Exxon . Bhopal was an act of Union Carbide . But the BP spill is an act of God . Oiliness is next to godliness . Forgive this blasphemy , but is it perhaps time to question the Doctrine of Boardroom Infallibility ? In Washington , belief in corporate divinity has become a bipartisan religion , and it 's polytheistic : Lawmakers , despite the occasional bit of populist rhetoric , routinely provide generous offerings to the automotive , aerospace , financial , pharmaceutical and insurance industries , along with petroleum . An article by The Post 's Dan Eggen explains why : More than 1,400 former members of Congress , staffers and federal employees registered as lobbyists in the financial services sector alone since the start of 2009 , according to a study by Public Citizen and the Center for Responsive Politics . Many of these lobbyists , of course , moonlight as fundraising captains for lawmakers . No wonder politicians have got the corporate religion . Rep. Don Young -LRB- R-Alaska -RRB- , furthering the act-of-God view , asserted that `` this is not an environmental disaster '' in the gulf `` because it is a natural phenomena . '' Rand Paul , the GOP Senate candidate in Kentucky , said the administration 's vow to keep a boot on the throat of BP is '' un-American . '' Former GOP presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said the criminal investigation of BP is a `` mistake . '' Democrats have been only slightly less devout . They 're giving no serious consideration to the demand from some on the left , including Robert Reich , to put BP into temporary receivership . The administration 's criminal investigation of BP has little chance of getting executives locked up . BP CEO Tony Hayward wo n't even commit to suspending BP 's dividend -LRB- more than $ 10 billion last year -RRB- , as some Democratic senators have demanded , and he put the clean-up cost at a paltry $ 3 billion over six months , far less than what many analysts say the real cost will be . That 's just one more contemptuous utterance from a man who has already dubbed the spill `` tiny , '' called environmental damage `` very modest , '' denied the existence of underwater oil plumes , suggested that sickened oil cleanup workers had food poisoning and complained that he wanted his '' life back . '' Americans feel the outrage more than their leaders do . A recent Gallup poll shows that 73 percent think BP has done a poor or very poor job . Overall , Americans are just as distrustful of corporations as they are of the federal government . A Pew Research Center poll released in April found that 64 percent think large corporations are having a negative effect on the country , compared with 65 percent who say that of the government . Yet the faux populists of the Tea Party train their anger on the government while giving corporations a pass . And Obama , accused of being a socialist , has actually been a no-fault capitalist , cleaning up corporate messes without winning much in the way of new laws to prevent a recurrence . Too many corporations have survived their misdeeds with no more than an angry hearing or two : GM , Chrysler , Toyota , Goldman Sachs , Citibank , Bank of America , Massey Energy . The legislative dressing-down obviously is n't sufficient deterrent . Neither is firing the CEO , because he 's invariably replaced by another just like him . Pardon the sacrilege , but for a real deterrent , it 's time to institute a corporate death penalty -- and BP is a perfect candidate . That sort of retribution would be divine .

But their opposition to BP 's handling of the crisis has yet to achieve critical mass , and any attempt to dissuade customers from fueling their cars with BP is likely to hurt the small-business owners who run the stations and have little or no effect on the British oil giant 's revenue . Most Americans -- seven out of 10 -- say BP has done a poor or only fair job in handling the April 20 well blowout and spill in the Gulf of Mexico , according to the Pew Research Center , which tracks public opinion . The Obama administration received slightly better marks , with 57 percent rating the government 's response poor or only fair . In light of this discontent , BP may have trouble charging a premium price at the pump for its products , said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service . `` We are starting to see some impact so far , and a percent of decline or two can have a dramatic impact , '' Kloza said . `` Unfortunately , it has an impact on what you might say are the victims : the marketers and the dealers that made commitments to fly the BP flag . '' BP 's petroleum products can be sold at other outlets under other brand names , making a consumer boycott tough to pull off . In any case , he said , price is the biggest factor determining where customers buy gas . Several U.S. groups , including the consumer watchdog Public Citizen and Vermont-based Democracy for America , have called for a BP boycott . Historically , energy boycotts have had minimal impact on companies ' revenue . Seize BP , a campaign aimed at getting the U.S. government to seize BP 's assets and redistribute them to those damaged by the spill , plans a week of demonstrations at gas stations and BP offices across the nation . The movement to seize BP 's assets is gaining ground on Facebook , where at least five groups are pushing the cause . There is also a spoof Twitter feed , BPGlobalPR , that purports to be the oil company 's online persona . The satirical feed has more than 114,000 followers , compared with the official BP -- America feed , which had less than 10,000 on Thursday . The fake feed has donated $ 10,000 to the Gulf Restoration Network from the sale of T-shirts emblazoned with an oil-smudged BP logo and the words `` bp cares .

Q. From what you 've seen and heard , do you think that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a major environmental disaster , a serious environmental problem but not a disaster , or is it not too serious an environmental problem ? Q. Do you think the federal government should or should not pursue criminal charges against BP and other companies involved in the oil spill ? Do you feel that way strongly or somewhat ? Public complaints against BP are twofold : Most give poor ratings to its reaction to the massive spill , and most blame the company and its drilling partners for taking unnecessary risks that could have caused the spill . But the government itself is also in the line of fire . More Americans have given negative ratings to federal reaction to the BP spill than poll respondents gave to the government 's initial handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . Overall , 69 percent of those polled now say the government has done a `` not so good '' or `` poor '' job handling the spill . More polled , 81 percent , give low marks to BP for its response . -LRB- Some 59 percent give negative ratings to both the federal government and BP . -RRB- Criticism of the government and BP crosses party lines and spans the country . The Democratic discontent with the government 's response today - 56 percent give it low marks - contrasts with majority GOP support for federal efforts a few weeks after Katrina struck in 2005 . Another sentiment shared across the partisan divide is the rising feeling that the situation in the Gulf represents a major environmental disaster . About three-quarters of those polled now say so , up significantly from a Pew poll last month . In the new Post-ABC poll , those who see the spill as a disaster overwhelmingly advocate criminal charges against BP and its partners , and altogether 64 percent of Americans say the government should pursue such legal action . Most Democrats -LRB- 74 percent -RRB- and independents -LRB- 67 percent -RRB- support criminal investigation ; Republicans divide 50 percent in favor , 44 percent opposed . The poll was conducted June 3 to 6 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults . The results from the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points . Q : -LRB- HALF SAMPLE -RRB- How would you rate -LRB- ITEM -RRB- 's overall response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - excellent , good , not so good or poor ? -- Positive -- - Negative - NET Excellent NET Poor The federal government 28 2 69 32 The oil company BP 16 1 81 54 Q : How much blame , if any , do you think -LRB- unnecessary risks taken by BP and its drilling partners ? -RRB- deserves for the oil spill - a great deal , a good amount , just some or none at all ? - Great deal\\/Good amount - -- Some\\/None -- NET Grt deal Good amt NET Some None All adults 73 55 18 23 17 6 Democrats 80 58 21 18 12 6 Republicans 61 42 19 34 28 6 Independents 76 61 14 22 16 5 By Jon Cohen | June 7 , 2010 ; 12:00 PM ET Where are the most important questions ? Rate President Obama 's actions to protect the wetlands , wildlife and affected residents of the Gulf . Rate President Obama 's handling of the gusher . We will need a Million Man\\/Woman Oil Spill Clean Up Job Corps . Texas , Louisiana , Alabama , Florida , Georgia , South Carolina and other States will need them soon , as well as Millions of Hay Bales . The USA -LRB- Obama , Congress , Senate , FEMA , National Guards , -RRB- must Take over the Clean UP , -LRB- while BP works to Cap the Spill -RRB- , and Authorize a `` Million Man effort '' to Clean up the Gulf Coast Oil spill . This includes Salaries , Transportation , Equipment and Accommodations all billed to BP . The regions hotels suffering from Cancelations could use the business , and the country needs both the Jobs and the Clean Up . Bill BP for the Clean up costs Weekly even if it s $ 1 Billion a week . `` Get the Money and Clean it UP '' . The Longer it takes to Stop , the Longer they Pay for the Damage . Bring in Oil Tankers to Suck in the Oil and Water and Post Smaller Skimmer Boats closer to the Shore to get out of their way !!! Tankers sit lower in the water than Skimmers . It worked in the Persian Gulf and it can work here ! The smaller Skimmer Boats should be using Smart Sponges that Suck up the Oil without the water . AbTech Smart Sponges Absorb Oil while Repelling Water and Float for easy retrieval and the Oil\\/Energy can then be Used instead of Wasted . With BP , it 's mostly white . BP lied -LRB- in pencil -RRB- on their drilling paperwork applications , BP broke it 's contract to provide all clean up and have all the necessary equipment ready to clean up oil spills . BP lied about the amount of oil coming from the leak for weeks and minimized everything about it . And yet people want taxpayers to pay to clean this up ??? Posted by : clairevb | June 7 , 2010 12:24 PM | Report abuse I was especially impressed by the residents of the area . There film over the weekend of a handful of BP workers cleaning the beach amid a sea of sunbathers . I know what they would say . `` It 's not my job to scoop up any of that oil . '' God forbid the locals pick up some oil blobs on their own . Red State American Values . Forty-two percent -LRB- 42 % -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of -17 ` verall , 46 % of voters say they at least somewhat approve of the president 's performance . Fifty-three percent -LRB- 53 % -RRB- disapprove . ' What does `` poor handling '' mean ? Not letting BP control the discussion ? The government does not possess equipment or better technical know-how than BP . That said , the administration needs to get moving and BP needs to admit fault and pay for all damages to the environment . However , I do n't really understand this whole Obama 's handling of the crisis issue . Do people want him to dive in and close the leak himself ? Gibbs said in the press conference that Obama and team constantly evaluated options but did n't elaborate on why certain ideas were discarded . If we had these details we would have insight into Obama 's judgment and then could say whether he handled the crisis properly . Currently though he is doing everything that any president would do - talks a lot about it , flies to the region , demands action from BP . What else do people want ? An important note from all this though is that he is blamed for poor handling just as Bush was blamed for Katrina . This shows that public is never satisfied with the leaders it elected . and O'BlahBlah 's actions are reacting with the incompetence and lack of coordination that they are known for !!! The Liar in Chief and the Fed . continue to point the finger of guilt at BP in THEIR efforts to divert the public spotlight AWAY from their own Incompetence , Mismanagement and total lack of Preparation !!! Posted by : thgirbla | June 7 , 2010 12:30 PM | Report abuse That 's because more Americans , considering the people who make up the majority in this country , care more about the loss of business , wildlife conservation and anything that makes Obama look inept than they do about the poor people of New Orleans that lost their lives and livelihoods to Hurricane Katrina . The sad part of it all is that the media , and conservatives -LRB- who would sell their collective souls to satan to have a major disaster like this blamed completely on Obama -RRB- compare an oil spill to the unnecessary loss of human life that stemmed from a levee that the government knew needed to be replaced . To me , there is no comparison and nothing can erase the memory of watching tens of thousands of human beings die and suffer while George Bush did nothing . But Obama rushed to handle the problem with the oil spill and people hate him . Well that makes since does n't it . Humans are n't as important as land . BP is paying Law Makers for support and even reporters\\/newspapers just as the Bush\\/Cheney propaganda did . What kind of civilizened country sees not problem with humans shown begging their Govenment for help as the Media shows people dying live on TV . Yet an Oil spill where people are demanding money for lost business and notice how no one is removing animals to safty knowing they will die . This is more political then reality and as long as the attacks on Obama continue the mission set out after election day to destroy Obama and the US will work . We are seeing the worse of our country as was seen during the Civil Rights Movement . No wonder the KKK endorsed Obama as President they knew they could get people to join their cause why hidding behind the Republican Party\\/Tea Party . HALLIBURTON that 's cheney to you and me . This catastrophe is not unprecedented . There was a huge oil rig blow out back in 1979 . So it happened before and anyone with any sense would know it could happen again . Let 's face it , these rigs are in a well observed annual hurricane belt . I recall during Hurricane Katrina that the big worrry was about the oil rigs . No one expected that the levies would be the problem . So , I am not blaming Obama for the disaster . We had Carter , Reagan , Bush I , Clinton , and Bush II whose administrations similarly did nothing to prepare for this inevitablitiy . But I do blame Obama for his cavalier treatment of this ecological nightmare . In the first month of the spill where was any proactive leadership ? Why , it was directed against the people of Arizona for enforcing the laws our Federal government have ignored . And Obama had time to hug Calderon of Mexico as well . This was HIS agenda . The destruction of our coastline just did not fit his political goals . What are they still doing ? Barry the inept bungler then sat on his hands for weeks after the deadly explosion and oil leak . The ball will fall to the bottom of the pipe -LRB- upstream -RRB- Repeating this experiment using mercury instead of steel -LRB- a column of 1,000 feet makes a pressure of 5,700 psi -RRB- , BP -LRB- losing some profits -RRB- may clog the sinister well and stop killing people , animals , seas , countries , planets ... Choose the best . What are they still doing ? It will be many decades before the Gulf Coast recovers from this preventable ecological disaster which was caused first & foremost by greed . And , the greed continues today . America has a single goal - stop the oil & clean it up . BP has a very different goal - stop the oil & clean some of it up while preserving the integrity of the well . There lies the disconnect & Obama should be bright enough to sieze their assets and take them out of control so we can persue americas goal - STOP THE OIL & CLEAN IT UP . BP 's goal `` to preserve the integrity of the well '' is precisely why oil continues to flow today - 47 days after the destruction of the rig . Does anyone actually doubt that ? IF so - just wait & see my friends - just wait & see ? There film over the weekend of a handful of BP workers cleaning the beach amid a sea of sunbathers . I know what they would say . `` It 's not my job to scoop up any of that oil . '' God forbid the locals pick up some oil blobs on their own . Red State American Values . As a resident of this oil spill . . I can tell you we are picking it up . Most of the people you see on nthe beaches are those who came in spite of the oil spill ... The Fed Govt has SPECIFICALLY told us in NO uncertain terms that we are NOT to touch the oil or pick it up ... We are NOT listening . . sorry you have n't seen us picking up tons of this stuff off of our beaches . . but we are doing it ... and have been ! It would figure that someone wants to attacks us because of voting records ... Posted by : tbastian | June 7 , 2010 1:04 PM | Report abuse BP keeps minimizing and distorting the facts , the press sensationalizes things , but is trying to get at the truth , the American People are standing by while our precious natural resources are being devastated , the oil keeps on gushing out , and the Obama Administration is still wringing their hands . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AND COMING TO THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS . AND THEY WILL SPEAK OUT THIS NOVEMBER , ON ELECTION DAY . THANK YOU DEMOCRATS FOR VOTING THIS RACIST OBAMA INTO OFFICE AS POTUS . If 9\\/11 Katrina and now this spill have taught us is to be thankful CA has fallen in the ocean yet or that we never did fight an all out nuke war with Russia . Stop posting on your lunch break . You have lots of work to do . Well I REALLY give these stupid raters negative ratings . You fools have been yelling for off shore drilling , less government control and no regulation of big business . Well fools what you have here is off shore drilling , no government control and no regulation . DUH what on earth do you fools really want miracles ! The government does not know a think about capping an oil pipe 1 mile under the sea where humans can not go . So the way I see it is STOP off shore drilling , much more government control and regulation of Big business . Problem solved so all you idiots shut up and go away . Besides the Russians are coming . Think they 'd take my small claim and process it rapidly or will I face months of delays ? It 's the economy , economy , economy . If improvements continue and hiring picks up , polls will reflect that by November obviously . Most folks simply did n't care enough to follow the events via several sources of news . The plain fact is that what has happened resulted from years of neglect and letting the private sector run things . Just like the right-wingers always wanted . What limited cleanup supplies the Feds had were in Alaska where the ex-guvna there swears oil is never spilled . While this is a very sad situation , little can be done fast to fix it . The technology was grossly oversold . When the MMS had the ` sex for oil ' scandal , the wake up call was ignored . Again , too many folks just did n't care enough to get involved . The 1979 spill off the Texas coast should have been the standard by which these wells should have been governed in the future . All those wanting to blame the president need to look at the right-wing and it 's ` Drill baby drill ' act . Strangely though , they are all quiet now , awaiting the next election so that we can once again have the ones who caused much of the woes today put back in office so that they can complete their full and maybe final decimation of what was once the best place on Earth . Many of these same voters simply do not understand the critical thinking process which needs to be done before anyone is elected or sent back for another term in office . The facts show that deregulation has never worked as intended in any area where it was applied . Americans have been sold too many lies by some whose only motive is to become grossly rich at the expense of the working class which for the most part is becoming extinct . We can only hope that one day most Americans wake up and see who is actually out to ruin this great country . This will require some effort since so many simply do not involve themselves in the steps it will take like voting and studying the issues . Really doing some heavy critical thinking . Who knows at this point . Cheers Posted by : Finn_McCool | June 7 , 2010 1:21 PM | Report abuse The questions here are too generic to be of much use ... do you approve\\/disapprove of the Federal Response does n't say why , and this is vital , especially if we 're drawing comparisons to Katrina . in the case of Katrina , the anti-big government party was in power , so their base still strongly approved of the Federal Response because they did n't believe there should be one . In this case , the pro-big-government solutions party is running the show , so both bases are strongly upset , with the Dems wanting a stronger federal response and Republicans torn between those wanting less regulation and less response -LRB- Geoge Will this past Sunday -RRB- , and those who want a stronger , more hands-on approach . We need a breakdown getting to that level , rather than simply saying approval\\/disapproval if we really want to figure this one out . Otherwise , the poll is just about spin by talking heads . The critical errors happened during the Obama administration , when it had been in office for about 15 months . So far none of the news media have been persistent at finding out the major cause of the blowout : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Why did BP engineers use oversize 7-inch lower production casing ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- Why did they use an inadequate volume of cement ? -LRB- 3 -RRB- Why did MMS approve these high-risk designs ? If those major errors had not been made , there would almost certainly have been no catastrophe . Since almost one-fourth of all the oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico show sustained casing pressure , it was clear that similar errors had been made many times before . Since about one in 400 Gulf of Mexico wells experiences a blowout , the environmental problems also are not rare . Since the world 's worst ocean oil disaster occurred in the Gulf of Mexico , 31 years ago at a shallow-water well , it was clear that another disaster was only a matter of time and chance . Before the recent catastrophe , there were many people warning the government about these problems . But under Secretary of the Interior Salazar those warnings were and are being ignored . His reorganization plan is only cosmetic , leaving most of the same people running the agencies who made most of the mistakes , under the same department . So yes , many people are blaming the Obama administration . It knew that there were major oil development hazards and major problems in the Interior department . It failed to correct the problems and failed to address the hazards . Did they insist that BP have a plan for a leak before drilling ? These inexperienced , no-nothing folks are more interested in vacations and image . Let 's get them out of there , starting in November . Most Americans to have opinions , but most Americans do not have informed opinions . When news organizations publish polls of what Americans think , it would be good to ask just what criteria or expertise most American have to credit their opinion as having any value . I think it is either lazy or cynical journalism to present the results of such polls . They are at best meaningless and at worst contribute to the mistaken notion that uninformed opinions have news value . This is a very different root cause than Katrina , where the Feds were responsible for creating the disaster conditions in the first place . With the oil spill , absence of regulation , chosen by the American people as what they wanted from government since the election of Ronald Reagan , has once again had a disastrous impact -- as it did with the S&L collapse and the ongoing recession . Americans ca n't have it both ways -- either government , federal and state , regulates capitalism with a heavy hand to protect the people , or it lets free enterprise run wild with inevitably terrible consequences . It is clear to EVERYONE in the world , that Obama and his team are failures , liars , and not very good leaders , except when they force new laws to be created , which the progressive socialist\\/communist MINORITY want . Of course Obama did n't create the problem , but instead of finding new ways to bankrupt our country , he should be sending the right resources to get the job done . It is inexcusable that it has taken this long . INEXCUSABLE ...

While it is possible some have been broken - i.e. Migratory Bird Laws that outlaw just about everything whether intentional or not - the roar from the public sounds a lot like `` Sentence First , trial second '' . Where is the massive clean-up effort ? It 's been nearly two months , and no end in sight . To-date we have a tiny fraction of the needed people working on containment and clean-up , with most of them performing in front of cameras ! Picking up tar balls one at a time by hand ?! In the meantime , efforts on the part of individual states have been hampered by the federal bureaucracy . In the meantime , the pitiful images of those poor oil-coated birds is enough to make one sick ! And not surprisingly , the so-called environmental groups have been relatively silent as we see one of the world 's worst environmental disasters unfold before our eyes . Yes , force BP to do whatever it takes to seal the leak , but it is the federal government 's responsibility ... from the President on down ... to protect our country from castastrophic damage . This holds true , whether it 's our shorelines or our borders ! But I do not believe that our current President sees it that way at all . It seems that we are being led by a Vigilante President who does n't understand the reasons for separation of governmental power . The Rule of Law seems ready to be thrown out by Obama , his Cabinet , and many members of Congress . If our judicial process is flawed , change it . But do it with Constitutional changes not by a Presidential Putsch . Americans should never allow the Executive Branch of government take over all judicial functions . America is at significant risk , with extremists on both the Left and the Right . Middle of the road Americans , who are in the majority , should resist any and all efforts of extremists , regardless of their party affiliation . Obama however , can not be blamed for the previous Eight years of ingrained obsfication and out-right flounting of environmental law by the federal government , endless sleezy sweet heart deals and payola scandals between the petrolium industry and government agencys and the perpetual turning of a blind eye to shoddy workmanship and non-existent contingentcy planning for major oil spills by the federal and state agencys responsible for overseeing the oil Industry in the Gulf of Mexico . No , this is the previous Administration 's legacy to Obama and our nation and no amount of double talk and chest beating comming from the Right will EVER change this fact . You should have said the Obama adminstration is doing a terrible job . But , of course , this is simply liberal media bias 101 , is n't it . When a Republican is in office , any problems are attributed to the adminstration by name , but when a Democratic is in office , it 's the amorphous `` government '' that is to blame . It 's wearing really thin . I feel so left out ... Where IS the full poll ? It would be good to read it directly instead of filtered through the Washington Post -LRB- even though the Post is half-owner - or maybe because it is ? -RRB- . Were `` pollees '' asked if civil charges should also be filed , or is that a given ? Do most of us really think that BP , et al , did this on purpose and thus are criminally liable ? And now are dragging their collective feet in order to stay on front pages , etc. , and keep the stock price falling ? Do we really think the Obama Administration should be held accountable for not responding with more vigor , with more ... ? If this administration HAD responded more vigorously -LRB- learn from Khrushchev ! Take your shoe off and pound the lectern !! -RRB- , it would now be berated for behaving like Big Brother , socialist , C-o-m-m-u-n-i-s-t . Terrible tragedies such as this one need all of us to pull together , to seek answers without rancor -LRB- there s plenty of time for that later -RRB- , not have so many people -LRB- including the admiral in charge for the administration -RRB- taking so much of their time answering the same questions over and over and over again before 24-7 reporters\\/cameras\\/etc . Instead of figuring out whom to blame right now , those of us who believe in its power should do some serious praying Posted by : jujones1 | June 7 , 2010 2:00 PM | Report abuse This is the Obama administration ... Now the Cheney oil disaster ... ... Remember folks the secret energy task force Dick Cheney put together in 2003 made up exclusively of BP , Mobil , and Exxon oil execs who Cheney allowed to write this nations regulattory policies . Including letting the oil companies exempt themselves from environmental and safety regulations . The result ... the BP oil disaster . Just look at all of these posters not just blaming Obama for something that the government really can not even fix . But they mock him and call him names . When THEIR President leaves people for dead for a whole week in a major metropolitan area of the U.S.A. they come to HIS defense . But a disaster literally 1 MILE below the surface of the ocean ? Time to call the President names like `` Obummie '' or `` Oblah-blah '' or `` Vigilante President '' . You people calling President Obama these immature names are nothing more than ice-cold I-D-I-O-T-S . I am one of them . I think the Obama administration people that did the last few inspections of the off shore oil rig should be prosecuted , they obviously are on the take , and did n't do the job they were hired to do at all . The people at BP that made the decisions and took the short cuts to save themselves money to pocket at the expense of all Americans in this accident should also be prosecuted . They took the short cuts , they are responsible for this disaster 100 percent . BP has had many violations in the past , and nothing has been done to them . Now we have to suffer for their actions . Prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent . However what the critics and the media pundits fail to realize is that President Obama is a real person and not one who plays a president on TV . These nattering nabobs of negativism think they are watching the West Wing TV show where a make-believe president neatly resolves whatever problem befall the nation by the end of the weekly show . And , both the liberal and conservative talking heads seem united in demanding that the President personally take charge of the crisis and that he take the oil company CEO by the scruff of his neck and put his head in a feces-filled toilet bowl . This might satisfy some but most people hope that he remain outwardly cool , calm and collected . There is broad agreement that Bush-like shooting from the lip or hip and Clintonesque , `` I feel your pain '' game , is NOT the way to go . As much as the press would like to see the President spend more time in the Gulf Coast it is better that he not go down there and personally take charge of the situation . This will only slowdown the response and would further disrupt the lives of ordinary citizens as anyone who has been delayed by a passing presidential motorcade will tell you . The media would better serve the nation by reporting on how the crisis came to be , rather than spend hours and hours opining on what the President should be and what he must do to solve it . Let Obama be Obama and with now-retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen as the national incident commander of the oil gusher disaster we will all get through this . Voters have spent the last thirty years or so dismantling the government to give us limited government and now we wish immediate response . Me thinks communications have broken down on many many fronts . BP only did what voters would allow it to get away with , which is another massive communications breakdown on many many fronts . In the decades and centuries ahead the oil spill will resolve itself . Saying we are gonna clean this up is political jargon to avoid reality . Polls confuse fact with opinion . Just because such-and-such percentage of some sample group believe something , does not even begin to make it true ! On the one hand , people are anti-government and do not want government involved in their lives . On the other hand , when a disaster occurs , then the government needs to be involved and fix the problem immediately -- you know , provide the quick fix -- even though it does n't have the tools that an oil company has . Besides , the loose non-regulations with oil and the oil companies does not rest with the current administration but with the Bush-Cheney administration who went to bed with the oil companies and allowed oil companies to co-op federal agencies . What people fail to note isObama did initiate action from day one . Unfortunately he did n't make a big photo-op out of the intial oil spill which Americans lap up . The next time a major problem occurs , the administration needs to make several photo-ops and spread across television . After all , it 's then that the American people will believe something is being done by our government . America 's majority is no longer . And the fact -LRB- fact -RRB- of the media filling all pages with `` tea party anger '' and Sarah Palin 's deepest thoughts how she hates Obama . Great democracy we got going here ! The anti-government wackos are the same -LRB- max -RRB- 30 % of Americans who thought GW Bush was doing a great job after he wrecked our economy . Now it is a Democrat ca n't spend money to stimulate the economy to create jobs -- which every economist in the world knows is the best thing in the world . Listen and forgive this in advance : there are many , many good people down in Louisiana , Texas , Alabama , Mississippi , and Florida , but like their Right Wing preachers like to say , `` this is God 's wrath on them '' ! Every ignorant voter in those five states who has constantly voted for Conservative candidates bashing government and praising the `` enterprise `` of the private sector are seeing not God 's wrath but a rebuke for being so stupid as to vote against their own interests . Please note how Rand Paul called Obama `` un-American '' for criticizing BP ! If Red States are going to rule the country , god bless all of us ! The facts no longer matter to wingnut morons in this country . And to creeps like screwjob , why do n't you take time from your endless posting and volunteer your time and services in Gulf ? 20,000 federal folks could sure use relief as well . Or is being the inspiration for massengil not of any use ? Umm , the Deepwater horizon rig has been operaating since 2001 ... '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- Why did MMS approve these high-risk designs ? '' One of the really big questions is whether MMS approved . Someone later asked if BP had filed plans with regulators to deal with such an accident and then stated `` obviously not , '' when in fact they did provide assurances that they had the necessary plan to deal with a spill ten times this size . this is where `` trust but verify '' comes in , a little too much trust in the oil companies and not enough verification apparently . `` Where is the massive clean-up effort ? It 's been nearly two months , and no end in sight . '' the sad truth , there is no real way to clean a wetland like those in Louisiana , many biologists think standard cleanup tchniques would do more harm than good . As would have Louisiana 's original idea to build earth walls around them to protect them from the oil in the first place - it would have blocked the oil , but also the flow of salt water and it 's mixing with freshwater , vital to the stability of those ecosystems . That might have saved the plants from oil , but still killed them just as predictably . Probably the sad truth is , as Wolff reported yesterday , Obama was probably briefed on Day 2 just how bad this was going to be and for how long , and the only real solution was the relief well . You ca n't turn around and promise bold action and vow to use the resources of the Federal Government to stop it when you know it wo n't do any good -LRB- and thus just further upset public expectations when efforts fail , as has been left to this point with BP itself -RRB- , and you ca n't pull a Michael Scott and walk into a national pressroom and say `` ladies and gentlemen , WE ARE SCREWED . '' The biggest government failre is in preventing this from happening in the first place and for not having a better emergency plan in place . Once it happened , it was too late . The easiest fixes for the future - do what other nations do and require at least one relief well pre-dug -LRB- I think Norway requires three , we do n't likely because it drives up the cost of the wells and drillin allies have probably blocked it in the past -RRB- , breaking up MMS as has now been proposed , and actual enforcement rather than the lax enforcement that has been ongoing for far too long . `` Should Federal Criminal Charges be pursued against the Obama Administration for Willful failure to take action for agenda\\/political reasons ? '' See , I 'm still confused , and this is why I want a better poll than approval\\/disapproval . Is the Obama administration a bunch of big government socialist\\/fascist thugs running over the constitution , or are they not doing enough and ceding too much responsibility to private corporations ? even his critics on this page ca n't agree -LRB- and some apparently disagree with themselves on their own posts -RRB- . Particularly the Man In Charge , Barack Obama . Those 30 % of the nation who hate Obama , well , this is still a racist nation . That 's what all the birther and `` socialist '' charges are all about . And again , the MSM is extremely active giving these viewpoints credence . Our elected president is doing a fantastic job under hard circumstances . He is trying to rescue us from our own selves . Nothing at wrong with that given our collective American selves are obviously close , very close to a piece of s. Posted by : walden1 | June 7 , 2010 2:41 PM | Report abuse Media needs to concentrate on unemployment and what has created it . The oil spill will resolve itself in the next few hundred years or so . It 's really too late to do anything now . The carcinogens and toxins are in the water and seabed . Wanna play ya gotta pay . Why would any reasonable person lay blame on President Obama for BP 's mess in the Gulf or liken the response of the White House this time to its response to Katrina ? -LRB- I remember the picture of Bush first viewing the ravages of Katrina from the safety of his helicopter window . -RRB- Some good may still come out of this : The secret files of the notorious meetings between Cheney and his energy task force revealed . Sadly , however , racism in this fair land will continue . See my post detailing sectors that could be impacted including Gulf , Florida and Southeast Coast tourism ; commercial and recreational fishing ; boating ; services in tourism areas ; ecosystem services ; health care . Katrina was a `` natural disaster '' caused by a huricane . BP Oil spill was a preventable man-made disaster caused by bad engineering , bad management , and bad regulators . You ca n't really get mad at the weather , but you sure as hell can point the finger at the people who mismanaged BP Oil . The RESPONSE to the BP OIL spill is slow Posted by : rmorris391 | June 7 , 2010 3:06 PM | Report abuse How many pieces of paper inked with images of dead presidents will it take to return the Gulf to its condition on 4\\/19\\/2010 ? Let 's look at what the poster child for loose regulations , the Republicans , did ; and we will see : . . 1 -RRB- They defeated new drilling regulations that might have prevented the Drill-Baby-Drill Oil Spill , 2 -RRB- Fought supporting development of the electric car , 3 -RRB- Fought research and development of sustainable alternative energy resources , 4 -RRB- Created a culture in America that Poo-pooed environmentalist as gloom and doomers , and butterfly chasers . ... And when it was discovered that the Chicken littles were telling the truth , Republican mouth pieces like Limbaugh , Beck , and farmsnorton continued to make up lies about them , Big Oil was pushed out into the deep waters ... HOGWASH ... . As if Big Oil wasn t greedy for the oil rich fields of the deep , after they had depleted most of the good fields in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico . 5 -RRB- Created a culture where agencies were just the bungling arms of an unworthy government who should only get out of the way and stop being a problem , 6 -RRB- Created a culture were agencies got into bed with the Corporations they regulated , 7 -RRB- In 2005 Republicans passed regulations which left environmental concerns to the judgment of the Oil Corporations , 8 -RRB- In November 2008 , a dozen Republican drill baby drill cohorts -LRB- two of them previous appointees with stanch Republican track records against environmental science and safety regulations -RRB- were made civil servants in high positions in the MMS , in order to delay for a long time Obama being able to have proper influence over that agency , 9 -RRB- Bush appointees headed MMS until Elizabeth Birnbaum , who was appointed by Obama , took office in July 2009 . Even after that , the dozen Republicans , who had at the last minute been entrenched high up in the MMS , remained there because of civil service laws -LRB- See : . . 10 -RRB- In April 2009 , three months before Elizabeth Birnbaum s appointment , while still operating under Bush appointees and the dozen entrenched civil servants , BP s Deepwater Horizon s permit was signed , wavers and all . 11 -RRB- Just last week Republicans prevented any raise on the $ 75 million economic injury cap better to have Americans to shoulder that trillion dollar of losses to their homes , jobs , and businesses . Now I agree in part with the Republicans . Obama should have moved faster ... Indeed , he was naive to think that after eight years of Republicans , he d be inheriting agencies that were professional ... ... OBAMA SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A FLAMETHROWER TO WHAT THE REPUBLICANS DID , AND THEN CORRECTED THEIR MISTAKES . After all ... they were black ... and we know how Republicans feel about `` those people '' . And now ... as is clear ... Republicans are MORE bothered that the `` evil federal government '' that they despise has n't stepped in and spent huge amounts of our tax dollars fixing things for a giant corporation that got away with murder under Republican deregulations . So much for all that `` state 's rights '' and `` stay out of big business '' or `` we 'll secede '' screaming we 've been hearing from the wingnuts these past eighteen months . Not clear how many lives could have been saved had the government acted quickly but let 's say 800 or so . Now while the gulf area will suffer for many years from this , most of these folks have their lives except for 11 who died on the rig . Now we get polls comparing the two . Well frankly , in my mind , there is no comparison . With the Louisiana government and senators , republicans and democrats daily trying to score political points against the president it 's no wonder people see the response negatively . First it s Carville blaming the WH for not doing enough . Next it s Jindall speaking with lightning speed suggesting he has all the answers . Next we have both of them asking the president to stop the deep sea moratorium before we determine what happened and how to prevent the problem from happening again . This is same attitude we ve had that got us into this mess in the first place . Also , why was the Louisiana state bird on the endangered list in the first place if they cared so much as they seem to now ? The problem we have in this country is that everything is done according to a poll . When do we stand up and do what s right regardless of the poll ? Americans have got to come together on these issues and stop playing politics with every issue . There is a sad state of affairs in this country . He is a complete failure Dont cry that Obama is getting blame for his failures ! He deserves the blame . . Obama however , can not be blamed for the previous Eight years of ingrained obsfication and out-right flounting of environmental law by the federal government , endless sleezy sweet heart deals and payola scandals between the petrolium industry and government agencys and the perpetual turning of a blind eye to shoddy workmanship and non-existent contingentcy planning for major oil spills by the federal and state agencys responsible for overseeing the oil Industry in the Gulf of Mexico . No , this is the previous Administration 's legacy to Obama and our nation and no amount of double talk and chest beating comming from the Right will EVER change this fact . Many ignored that warning . New Orleans under their Mayor did not get those people out when they thousands of buses just sitting there with no one to drive them . . It is not Bushs fault that these people decided to stay and die . The levies were not going to be fixed just before that storm . There was no way anybody could have fixed them that fast . The response to this oil spill was worse then Katrina . This Bozo who is President was out playing golf and taking Michelle out to dinner while this was going on . He is a total joke . He lies when he says they were at it since day one . It is now day 49 and he still has done nothing but started committees that do nothing . He is killing us slowly . He will not be our President next time ... Posted by : CaptainSad | June 7 , 2010 3:31 PM | Report abuse How was the President to fix the problem ? The media should answer that question ! The news media was out everyday saying that the President should do something ; the President should get mad ; the President should say this or that . Just shut up , please ! You people in the media need to suggest how to solve this problem . I was taught that if you come with a complaint and a problem then come with a solution . Was the President to call out the military to spoon the oil off the surface or build a pipe or dig a new well in 2 hours ? What could the President do , really ? Getting angry and calling the people who created this problem and what would you have the President to say ? The first thing that needed to happen is to grieve for those who lost their lives ; call in the experts to asset the problem ; once the problem has been asseted than figure out how to fix the problem . But you media people need to make up your minds , BP is a private international company who obtained the permit to drill on American soil from a foreign country . How does an the American government take control of a foreign company by seizing their assets and that is what our government has done . You people cried that the federal government was taking over the banks and auto industry when the government support the companies ; now you are yelling that the government did n't do enough in this case . Make up your minds . Mr. President , you are correct to keep calm , rely on experts for advice and move slowly to take our oil wells back from foreign countries . I support you 100 % . By the way , whatever happened to Obama s Eric Holder gathering information to determine sufficient grounds to file criminal charges against BP ? The American people probably won t hear about it again because an investigation into criminal or civil violations would back fire on the U.S. government federal agencies involved with BP . What a news scandal that would be U.S. v. BP court battle to determine who s at fault for the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . Got to admire their creativity and I was tired of doe eyed looks from casters asking `` what new pain for me . '' The poll probably omitted hard and important questions , too , like : What should the government have done on Day 1 ? c. Nationalize BP and take over the entire recovery effort . We all know damn well that doing c would have created a public big government uproar . We all know that b and b2 would go unanswered except , perhaps , to suggest that the well be nuked , a stupid idea . More important though is that the negative response clearly indicates folks continuous need to blame others than themselves . The spill and BP 's behavior is the result of laizzes faire and free market economics and politics in vogue since Ronald Reagan uttered the phrase `` government is the problem . '' The fools bought the lie are now unable to accept their share of the blame . I am reminded of the rationing in the 70s caused by a Middle East crisis . At the time it was popular to be for oil independence and conservation . But , immediately after the crisis and rationing ended , independence and conservation disappeared into the woodwork . The SUV is the perfect example . Is n't it time to own up to our responsibilities instead of blaming others . True but really irrelevant . It may be improved and every drop it catches is a bonus in my mind . Success is usually a series of improvements . `` Criticism of the government and BP crosses party lines and spans the country . The Democratic discontent with the government 's response today - 56 percent give it low marks - contrasts with majority GOP support for federal efforts a few weeks after Katrina stuck in 2005 . '' I actually feel sorry for that BP supervisor who insisted that the drilling mud be replaced by seawater ; he had no clue that 11 men would die and BP would have a multi-billion dollar clean up problem - he probably just wanted to impress the guys in the main office . But procedures have to change and business culture has to change - the view that shortcuts are O.K. if they save a few dollars for bonuses has to go . It 's one thing to say 69 % disapprove , but if this is sixth or seventh on their list of concerns behind jobs , the economy , etc. , then it 's not as big a deal , whereas when Katrina hit , it moved up towards the top . Obama 's job is not to plug the damn hole but to protect our Gulf States shoreline . Obama was negligent and incompetent in dealing with this as a president . It took many weeks before Obama was forced to go to Louisiana and only after Obama was criticized by his own ardent democratic supporter which include James Carville . Even then Obama continued to party including Paul McCartney , playing Golf , Basketball , fundraising , campaigning . Obama has no American values at all in his heart . Obama is letting our country be destroyed irreversibly by ignoring our national security as proven by 4 islamic terrorist atttacks on our homeland in just 15 months of Obama in office . Obama was unable to turn the economy around and we have a high unemployment rate because instead of the the multiple job stimulus bills to help the ordinary Americans it was actually used to bail out Obama 's cronies in wall street , big banks , automakers and unions which give all politicians kickbacks and bribes and also to protect the politicians massive investments in money and stocks on wall street and big banks . This is why now we have a $ 13 trillion in debt and the Obama gov ' t is continuing to SPEND MASSIVELY AND BORROW MONEY MASSIVELY , INCREASE TAXES IN JANUARY 2011 , RATIONING AND MORE SPENDING IN OBAMACARE WHICH WILL COLLECT BEGINNING IN JAN. 2011 HIGH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND TAXES ON EVERYBODY INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE YOUNG AND HEALTHY OR FACE FINES AND PENALTIES , BUT THE HEALTH COVERAGE DOES N'T KICK IN UNTIL 5 YEARS FROM NOW . We are being mocked and attacked by all our enemies including our allies in South Korea and Israel . We are defenseless and vulnerable militarily and economically . We are running out of time rapidly and the US military should save us now before it is too late .

First , the GS system , which most of the various department employees are classed under , was set up to deliberately shield the workforce from political influence -LRB- read , political activities on the part of the party in power -RRB- , and second , the practice of `` burrowing '' , by which political appointees are converted to career employees need to be considered to truly understand the actions , or lack thereof , on the part of this `` federal government '' lack is so blithely referred to as a monolithic entity . Many of the front-line employees who potentially could be culpable for the gross negligence , i.e. drill rig inspectors , were most probably hired , reviewed , and promoted during the prior administration . Also , intransigent MMS employees such as the regional Alaskan office that have shown themselves to be `` in bed '' with the oil companies are almost certainly long-time career employees that the current administration did not hire , review , retina , and promote -LRB- there just has n't been enough time -RRB- . So , to review for the ignorant and simplistic among us : the current administration could not have possibly hired the employees whose failures have contributed to BP 's , Transocean 's , and Halliburton 's dismal technical performance . Nor could the annual review process had enough time to `` weed them out '' . While we 're at it , are the calls for government an indication that the populace feels that petroleum engineering and deep-water submersible technology are `` core government '' functions that ca n't be outsourced to private concerns like BP , etc ? That certainly has n't been what has been said for the past thirty years or so . So , make up your minds , outsourced governmental functions whose performance is outside of review or control , or accountable government employees ? You ca n't have it both ways , geniuses . is it time to post every resource that has been deployed again . Or how much bureaucratic coordination had to be done . From the Coast Guard to the fisherman who lost everything ????? I 've got the list . The stats are phenominal of what the US Government -LRB- with our Congress -RRB- and the White House has deployed to fight this . BP is to blame . And what do they do , pay dividends and waste money on commercials . Son of Top Hat is not working as well as it should , but they wo n't let you know that . Admiral Thad Allen has to give America the stats . Wo n't hear it from BP . And now BP wo n't acknowledge the 2 plumes that have developed a mile away from the rig ... nor will they acknowledge the 3rd breach in the pipeline . The psi is going to be too much . And Son of Top Hat will pop right off . Or explode right off . BP only was going to drill one relief well ... White House told them they will build two . White House is giving the orders and BP does n't like it one bit . AND , BP accountants better be working 24\\/7 to write the checks to the families affected . Families can go through SBA and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund because along with the 69 million invoice the White House gave to BP ... another one for 8.1 billion is coming down the pike . New figures show this spill will cost 425 billion dollars . ANd you can bet , the President will RIDE HERD on BP to pay . So now it is Obama 's turn to be seen as the failure when a bad thing happens on his watch ; that is as it should be . Does this mean we now build more nuclear , solar , wind and etc. ; I havent seen that push yet , and that will be the biggest failure of all . The BP CEO gets on TV every day to say he is going to pay for all of this ; its hard to figure out the point of Obama then saying the same thing as if its a new idea of some sort . All big-time crap takes a really long time to resolve , longer than our life spans can easily adjust to it . Examples : Bay Bridge breaks in 1989 SF earthquake , new span ready in 2014 ; Muslim attack on WTC in 2001 , area built up again in -LRB- fill in the blank -RRB- ; Arab Oil Embargo of 1973 , and we 'll adjust to that new reality by -LRB- when exactly ? -RRB- . How long to come up with some decent technical means to fight these runaway gushers in the future-no one knows , we just know how to file lawsuits and scrape 40 % off the top . I still haven t see or heard any Republican who will even admit that Bush was once POTUS . Bush and Cheney are still causing havoc with their gosh darn exploding offshore oil rigs this time . Well , Republicans never did care anything about the environment , or clean air or clean water . Now that they 've got their lungs full of pollution in their own back yards breathing that stench of spilled oil and wondering how long before they get sick from it , maybe next time they 'll remember why they do need clean air and clean water . Rate President Obama 's actions to protect the wetlands , wildlife and affected residents of the Gulf . Rate President Obama 's handling of the gusher . '' What about the Big Oil Companies like Halliburton , BP and Trans Ocean who ACTUALLY spilled the oil ? You just love the oil companies and you just hate President Obama , we already know what you 're going to say and really do n't care to hear anymore . Now go breathe in that bad air and keep yourself quiet while the grown ups handle this mess . Obama was n't ready to present , he has n't projected confidence in his `` role . '' In fact , he seems to find it a `` chore , '' best left to his WH staff , or whomever ? To wit , however , someone prompted Obama to claim he was `` in charge . '' -LRB- ???? -RRB- This morning Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , having demonstrated the near genius command of the situation , further displayed the height of military form and discipline as he stood by `` Gabby Gibby '' who was attempting to project his very limited comprehension of the issues surrounding control of the oil debacle as if he knew what he was talking about ; at that time Admiral Allen gallantly and gently took over the presentation . Just love the `` brusin '' of BP for costs of Public Relations ; next Obama will retain that expertise ? Discipline of the Armed Forces is unforgiving ; they do n't have a UNION to secure them from incompetence . And our federal bureaucracy of those highly paid and secured union folk could n't handle Toyota , the building financial crises ? And the figures were damning 70 % who thought the government was amiss , absent or off on the golf course . As onetime newspaperman , that would be my headline , not BP . But not for the Obama - besotted media . With all the millions of unemployed people , why could n't the government have employed some of them to clean the beaches & save these creatures ? TO Truth1 : Have you been reading -LRB- or watching -RRB- the media or reading the government 's propaganda ?

Now , have any of you in the past said we need smaller government , government needs to stay out of the way of business , or business needs less regulation ? Perhaps I 'm naive or just old fashioned but I refuse to the follow this path . But it 's clear that many of the comments here do take that path . Almost as sad as the environmental disaster now unfolding in the GOM . As one comment here notes , there is plenty of blame to go around . That is so very correct . BP 's certainly at the top but the regulators failed in several areas , particularly the MMS . But knowing that and accepting it in no way can be translated to Obama-bashing or name calling . No President can know everything the Administration is doing , or NOT doing . Plus the President has to find ways to keep the system working , which sometimes involves compromises and deal making . After all if Mr. Obama had on his second day in office stopped all deep-water GOM drilling and there followed a shortage of gasoline for the US we 'd be reading the results of a poll about that crisis today , probably with just as many comments about how the President had failed , ca n't be trusted , and is a fool . It 's just not possible to make all people happy all the time . That 's begs the question , of course of just how long would most Americans sit still and accept gas rationing to prevent further such disasters , especially if this rationing interfered with getting to work , going on vacation , or going to see the __________ play ? We are entering day 50 , and for Pete 's sake , still do not know who is in charge -- the retired Coast Guard Admiral is doing his best , but have an idea that the munchkins in Washington are holding him back . Does Obama just not understand that his weakness is being observed with interest by our adversaries ?? What will he do if Iran starts a problem with Israel ? BLAME IT ON BUSH ?????? Oh -- understand that Obama is going to feign ` toughness ' with Brian Williams on June 8 -- telling Williams that he meets with his people and scientists to determine ` whose `` butts '' to kick ' ! Hope Williams had the good sense to ask him who he as kicked !! Posted by : wheeljc | June 7 , 2010 7:38 PM | Report abuse Chris Matthews just did a segment on Hard Ball and blamed the whole Gulf Oil Spill fiasco on Dick Cheney and Halaberton . The first task is to stop the flow of oil and cap the damaged well . Second comes the clean-up and environmental remediation . Then come the bills , followed by the lawyers . If she decides upon a legal career , my third-grade granddaughter may be among those lawyers who will become involved with the future litigation that is bound to smother the courts . She may be near retirement -LRB- although lawyers never retire -RRB- when everything is resolved . There are many questions yet to be answered . There are many allegations that have to be proven . There are many contractual agreements that have to be examined and interpreted . By the time the questions are answered , litigated , appealed , and appealed some more , our current President will be a former President with a library to his name . BP probably will not exist in its present form , and the brown pelicans probably will again be thriving in their native habitat . We 'll all should be smarter about the risks of deep-water drilling and hopefully be less demanding of fossil fuel . In the meantime , focus on the present -- and do it quickly . Obama s speech is still on You-Tube . These books are in the Jewish part of the Bible , the Old Testament , which is also part of the Christian Bible . Note that Obama has never even CRITICIZED the Koran , much less MOCKED it . Deuteronomy 28 , in the very book Obama mocked by name , pronounces specific curses : 15 However , if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today , all these curses will come upon you and overtake you team obama confusion and stupidity ?? 20 The LORD will send on you curses , confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to , until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him ineffective failed stimulus billions unable to produce any jobs ??? 38 You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little , because locusts will devour it . 39 You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes , because worms will eat them . 40 You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil , because the olives will drop off . foreign debt loss of national sovereignty ??? 43 The alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher , but you will sink lower and lower . 44 He will lend to you , but you will not lend to him . He will be the head , but you will be the tail . but like an infomerical -- theres more obama calls more curses down on his head by his ceaseless nonstop political attacks on israel assuring the curses in genesis 12 and 27 then finally obama demands israel cede jerusalem incurring the specific curse in zechariah : Zechariah 12:3 -LRB- New International Version -RRB- 3 On that day , when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her , I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations .

The situation would be a lot better now if President Obama had , within one week of the oil rig explosion , simply sent a squad of Marines backed by the US Navy to close down every BP oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico and assure the American people that they would remain closed until the underwater gusher was shut down , the oil pollution cleaned up , and the investigation into what went wrong was complete . BP has insufficient incentives to resolve this mess and as the trillion dollar catastrophe matures , public expectations will develop for the federal government to step in to manage the cleanup and bear the costs , however vast . BP 's army of attorneys are cagily anticipating that development and noting Exon 's success in stalling reimbursements for cleanup expenses . Some are still pending . Default Engineering is a simple process of designing devices , in the absence of intelligent direction or power resources , to respond in a way that minimizes dangers , costs , and inconvenience . An elementary example is a refrigerator door , when abandoned , will use abundant gravity and careful balancing to close itself . The BP\\/Halliburton blowout preventer was apparently devoid of any default engineering and no amount of surface meddling could make the valves on the device close . An effective , well-engineered blowout preventer would have cost a few thousand dollars more , but instead the United States has a trillion dollar disaster on its hands and we can ill afford the cost of an effective clean up . Is Attorney General Holder prosecuting any of the MMS staff for their dereliction of duty ? And have those clowns ever heard of default engineering ? This must change , obviously . BP was greedy and brought this upon the Gulf . BP has rejected other solutions , choosing instead solutions which seem to allow for later use of the well , rather than an immediate and permanent sealing of it . Obviously , the govenment has to create a specialized deep water emergency operations to deal with wells like this in the future . The current law has to changed to allow the feds to take over without incurring liability to the well owner , which is not what the situation is now . Had Obama taken charge brought in the Navy , Marines , and seized control of BP assets and employees , and failed , the disaster would have been the taxpayers from the day he acted , not BPs . Now , if we take over because of its continued failures , BP is still liable . I wonder what King George II would have done ? Set off a bomb to seal it , and really released the oil flow ? There is a company called NALCO . Goldman Sachs , Blackstone and Apollo all purchased NALCO . NALCO is based in Chicago with subsidiaries in Brazil , Russia , India , China and Indonesia . NALCO is associated with the University of Chicago Argonne program . The Obamas both worked for the University of Chicago . UChicago Argonne received $ 164,000,000 in stimulus funds this past year and just added two new executives to its roster : one from NALCO , the other from the Illinois Department of Education . If you dig a little deeper you will find NALCO is also associated with Warren Buffett , Maurice Strong , Al Gore , Soros , Apollo , Blackstone , Goldman Sachs , Hathaway Berkshire . Warren Buffet\\/Hathaway Berkshire increased their holdings in NALCO just last November . -LRB- Timing is everything -RRB- . The dispersant chemical is known as Corexit . What it does is hold the oil below the water s surface . It is supposed to break up the spill into smaller pools . It is toxic and banned in Europe . NALCO says they are using older and newer versions of Corexit in the Gulf Posted by : yourmomscalling | June 7 , 2010 8:47 PM | Report abuse On what grounds would the US Government have to file criminal charges when no laws were actually broken ? How can the US point any blame at all when the regulators were exposed to be in the oil companies ' pockets ? Pray tell , who do you suppose set up those relationships ? Is BP considered such a behemoth now that we are to believe they came over and set up these cozy friendships with our regulators ? Wake up and smell the crude . Here everyone is a master engineer with all the answers if people would just listen to them . Here everyone has figured out how it is all just one big conspiracy to screw the common man and make the fat cats richer . Tying NALCO with the University of Chicago and Obama is classic . I would say that post exemplifies `` crackpot '' in its grandest display if I did n't think the poster was actually trying to be funny . One thing is for certain ... reading through some of the comments truly shows the base level of intelligence in this country . Make them work to clean up the mess , wearing leg irons . And I do mean all of them . The clowns surfing porn sites instead of doing their jobs . The big-business-first politicians who made the system fail . Secret energy policy writers who refused to be accountable -LRB- I mean Cheney -RRB- . The meat puppet who let all of this happen -LRB- I mean 43 and his staph -RRB- . This is n't a BP disaster . This is an oil industry disaster . Why are n't other companies pitching in to help ? It would be good publicity for them . But other companies are just as responsible . Transocean owned the platform . They have some responsibility , too . -LRB- I say that as a stock holder . -RRB- Halliburton -LRB- Cheney surfaces again -RRB- performed work on this platform just before the failure . And the equipment company who made , installed and maintained the faulty blowout protector , they are responsible , too . Where is the accountability for these people ? But listening to the rants and raves and the current government is the culprit . The right-wingers are rewriting history again and the leftist are letting them get away with it . Do none of these people care about the truth of the matter ? Are they really so eager to search out scapegoats and skip past the truth ? After all , the truth of the matter is that after the criminal neglect of their duty , both on the part of the previous Administration AND the MMS , there is no way the current Administration could have done any better . The damage done under Bush and Cheney is just too great . Thanks to them , NO agency of the US government has the equipment or the expertise to clean up major oil spills . What expertise there is , is among the oil companies . This is a sad situation , of course . But this IS the damage Bush and Cheney have done . What is worse , it is n't even close to all the damage they have done to our environment and energy industry . It is just the tip of the iceberg . Why , the damage is so great , I 'll bet there are people at BP who now wish they had had the government insisting on that acoustic switch after all . The switch is expensive , but it cost a LOT less than cleanup will cost ! And even the most short sighted exec at BP must have known that Republicunning pampering of the oil industry was not going to last forever : surely they knew the next Administration would be much more willing to hold their feet to the fire to make them pay for the damage -- and then some . So yes , they should have known that saving the money by skipping the switch was a false economy , one that now is costing them a LOT more than the cost of that switch . However , I do n't really understand this whole Obama 's handling of the crisis issue . Do people want him to dive in and close the leak himself ? '' He would do far worse damage to the country down there than he 's doing up here . Barack Hussein Obama , mmm , mmm , mmm is every bit the failure some predicted him to be . Unfortunately , there is no way to have an intelligent discussion with all those racist haters . Right wing tactics work , for about 30 % of the US population . Keep on watching FOX News and enjoy your trailers and outhouses . Oh , the inconsistencies of it all . I think Obama is a magnificent human being who is doing the very best he can under an incredible burden of trying circumstances ... not the least of which is the wish of the Republicans that he `` fail '' . You think McCain\\/Palin could have even begun to handle this ? No wonder it refuses to tell -- each barrel is worth royalty money it owes , so the lower the figure BP says is flowing into the Gulf of Mexico , the lower its liability to the American taxpayer . What a cheap and corrupt company BP is . After the blowout is plugged and it pays the cleanup costs , the company should be sued for royalties , then kicked out of America . $ 100 million is a drop in a bucket to them and they can just pass on the cost to drivers . If found guilty of negligence or wrong doing the penalty should be the same as if you or I were negligent and bankrupted thousands of people and killed off co-workers and millions of animals . We would be sued for all we owned and spend the rest of our lives in prison . Since the Supreme Court recently declared that Corporations -LRB- foreign and domestic -RRB- are equal to us U.S. citizens for elections then the CEO and Board members should be treated equally to us in a criminal case . Is n't that right Justices Scalia , Roberts , and Thomas ?

The controversy over the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers and sent oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico is spilling into Washington as BP and others enlist help from the city 's lawyers and lobbyists to deal with a growing list of civil suits , government inquiries and federal investigations . Here 's a look at some of the key players on the legal front . The chair of WilmerHale 's public policy and strategy practice group and a member of the firm 's controversy department , Gorelick has represented the oil giant in prior hearings on Capitol Hill . Prior to joining the firm in 2003 , Gorelick was the vice chair of mortgage giant Fannie Mae for five years , but it is her long tenure as second-in-command in the Clinton administration 's Justice Department that makes her an appealing choice for companies in crisis . She is also currently representing financier Steven Rattner , who oversaw the government bailouts of Chrysler and General Motors , in the Securities and Exchange Commission 's investigation into whether he paid off officials to win business from New York 's pension fund . Thomas H. Milch , Arnold & Porter The chairman of Arnold & Porter , who will be representing BP on the environmental aspects of the Deepwater Horizon spill , has a wealth of experience handling environmental lawsuits brought by private parties . As the former head of the firm 's environmental practice group , Milch counseled companies on environmental compliance issues , advised corporations about lawsuits brought under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and has recently focused his practice on remedial measures taken at ecologically contaminated sites . In addition to matters he has handled for clients , Milch has been a member of the American Bar Association 's committee on environmental law , chaired an ABA committee on environmental litigation and served on the boards of the Environmental Law Institute , Wildlife Trust International and Resolve , a nonprofit dispute resolution group that handles environmental matters . John H. Beisner and Ivan A. Schlager , Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom The two Skadden partners will be representing drilling rig owner Transocean in front of Congress . Schlager heads the firm 's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States practice ; Beisner is co-head of Skadden 's mass torts and insurance group . Beisner , who joined Skadden from O'Melveny & Myers last year , has a history representing corporations in a variety of high-profile crisis situations , including Merck in the Vioxx painkiller lawsuits , Bank of America in its settlement with state attorneys general over troubled Countrywide mortgages and Ford Motor in litigation over faulty Firestone tires . Schlager has a depth of experience developing regulatory strategies during multinational mergers and acquisitions , but it is his work representing corporations during congressional and government investigations , including Fox Broadcasting and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios , that likely appealed to Transocean as it faces multiple government inquiries .

About 80 percent of the Gulf of Mexico 's recent oil production has come from deepwater operations , defined as water depths exceeding 1,000 feet . In 1996 , that was 20 percent . Jack-up rigs , which are oil platforms on stilts in a few hundred feet of water , have given way to the `` mobile offshore drilling unit '' -LRB- MODU -RRB- . It keeps its position through the interaction of global positioning satellites and on-board engines that activate directional propellers to offset ocean currents and wind . Seismology and submersible robotic technology have also advanced . The Deepwater Horizon rig was not testing new limits . It was drilling in about 5,000 feet of water when others have approached 10,000 feet . The safety record was good . The American Petroleum Institute , the industry 's main trade group , says that since 1947 , oil companies have drilled more than 42,000 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and recovered about 16.5 billion barrels of oil . Against that , spills totaled about 176,000 barrels from 1969 to 2007 . In a typical year , it was a few hundred barrels . By contrast , recent production is about 1.6 million barrels a day . Cost-cutting by BP , careless rig operators and lax regulators have all been fingered as plausible culprits in the blowout . President Obama has appointed a commission to investigate the causes , and the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation . There will be extensive analyses . But the stark contrast between the disaster 's magnitude and the previous safety record points to another perverse possibility : The success of deepwater drilling led to failure . Continuing achievements obscured the dangers . This pattern applies to other national setbacks . Consider the financial crisis . It was not the inherent complexity of subprime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations -LRB- CDOs -RRB- that caused the crisis . It was the willingness of presumably sophisticated investors to hold these securities while ignoring the complexity and underlying risks . But this behavior was understandable at the time . The economy seemed to have become less risky . High inflation had been suppressed . Since 1982 , there had been only two relatively mild recessions , those of 1990-91 and 2001 . Economists talked of the `` Great Moderation . '' The stock , bond and foreign exchange markets had become less volatile ; day-to-day price movements were smaller and less erratic . One study of the 2004-06 period found that stock market volatility in seven advanced countries had dropped about a third from historical averages and that bond market volatility was down almost a fifth . Well , if the economy and markets had become less risky , then traders and investors could take what once would have seemed greater risks to increase profits . They did -- and created new vulnerabilities for markets and the economy . The belief that past economic and financial instability had been quelled encouraged future instability . Or take the Toyota scandal . Few auto companies enjoyed as envious a reputation . Toyota consistently did well in surveys of reliability and customer satisfaction . This success -- and the resulting image inside the company and among government officials -- helps explain why Toyota reacted so slowly to problems with its accelerators and why government officials were not more assertive . Problems were minimized because they seemed out of character for Toyota . One theory of the oil spill is that the deepwater technology is inherently so complex and dangerous that it ca n't really be understood or regulated . The safety record before the BP spill seems to rebut that . The problem is that the system broke down . Careless mistakes were made . Or regulators were co-opted by industry . The post-crisis investigations will presumably fill out the story . But they may miss the larger question of why . No one has yet suggested that the blowout reflected a previously unknown geological phenomenon -- something in the oil formation -- or a quirk of technology that no one could have anticipated . Perhaps studies will reveal one or the other . But the prevailing assumption is that this accident was preventable , meaning that human error was responsible There 's a cycle to our calamities or , at any rate , some of them . Success tends to breed carelessness and complacency . People take more risks because they do n't think they 're taking risks . The regulated and the regulators often react similarly because they 've shared similar experiences . The financial crisis did n't occur so much because regulation was absent -LRB- many major financial institutions were regulated -RRB- but because regulators did n't grasp the dangers . They , too , were conditioned by belief in the Great Moderation and lower financial volatility . It is human nature to celebrate success by relaxing . The challenge we face is how to acknowledge this urge without being duped by it .

The confidential inquiries , which have not previously been made public , focused on a rash of problems at BP 's Alaska oil-drilling operations . They described instances in which management flouted safety by neglecting aging equipment , pressured employees not to report problems and cut short or delayed inspections to reduce production costs . Similar themes about BP operations elsewhere were sounded in interviews with former employees , in lawsuits and little-noticed state inquiries , and in e-mails obtained by ProPublica . Taken together , these documents portray a company that systemically ignored its own safety policies across its North American operations -- from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico to California and Texas . Executives were not held accountable for the failures , and some were promoted despite them . Tony Hayward has committed himself to reform since becoming BP 's chief executive in 2007 . Under him , the company has worked to implement an operating safety system to create `` responsible operations at every BP operation , '' said Toby Odone , a company spokesman . BP has used the system at 80 percent of its operations and expects to bring it to the rest by the end of the year , he said . Odone said the notion that BP has ongoing problems addressing worker concerns is `` essentially groundless . '' Because of its string of accidents before the April 20 blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , BP faced a possible ban on its federal contracting and on new U.S. drilling leases , several senior former Environmental Protection Agency department officials told ProPublica . That inquiry has taken on new significance in light of the oil spill in the gulf . One key question the EPA will consider is whether the company 's leadership can be trusted and whether BP 's culture can change . The reports detailing the firm 's Alaska investigations -- conducted by outside lawyers and an internal BP committee in 2001 , 2004 and 2007 -- were provided to ProPublica by a person close to the company who thinks it has not done enough to fix its shortcomings . A 2001 report noted that BP had neglected key equipment needed for an emergency shutdown , including safety shutoff valves and gas and fire detectors similar to those that could have helped prevent the fire and explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the gulf . A 2004 inquiry found a pattern of the company intimidating workers who raised safety or environmental concerns . It said managers shaved maintenance costs by using aging equipment for as long as possible . Accidents resulted , including the 200,000-gallon Prudhoe Bay pipeline spill in 2006 -- the largest spill on Alaska 's North Slope -- which was blamed on a corroded pipeline . Similar problems surfaced at BP facilities in California and Texas .

'' Instead , he is seeing serious-minded researchers . Lots and lots of them , quietly collecting samples . They come with glass jars , fiberglass mesh and cameras , ready to gather , label and test samples of the oil and the flora and fauna it threatens -- independent scientists whose work is truth-squadding the crisis as it unfolds , making it impossible for any single source , whether BP or the government , to dominate the flow of information about the giant oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . `` There are people everywhere doing amazing work to try to understand what 's happening , '' Ian MacDonald , an oceanography professor at Florida State University , said as he drove back to his lab in Tallahassee after spending several days collecting oil samples . MacDonald , who was among the first to challenge reports about the spill 's flow rate , plans to use the samples to help interpret data being collected from satellites , planes and other remote-sensing systems that are tracking the oil . Elsewhere on the gulf , university researchers are striving to identify and draw attention to what they say are vast plumes of oil hovering below the surface . `` If you think of information as a wave , the wave of truth in this calamity is not being driven by the government and government information sources . It 's being driven by independent academics who are working under pressure and creatively to get information out , '' MacDonald said . `` It 's truly astonishing to see what 's happening . The data cloud is so large and so complex , it 's beyond the scope of one person to figure it out . '' At least for now , the flood of scientists , graduate students and environmental researchers who have descended on the coastal marinas and beaches to get an up-close look at the spill and take the measure of this unprecedented event is an odd silver lining to the dark cloud of oil that threatens the livelihoods of Beach and other charter captains who are within reach of the heaviest slick . Beach typically makes 80 percent of his yearly income from the tourists who come to fish the gulf waters in May , June and July . `` When this thing happened , '' Beach said of the oil spill , `` I had every single day booked through July . Beach said ferrying the scientific crowd is preferable to some of the other makeshift jobs available , and he estimates that he is recouping 60 percent of what he would have made if his boat were booked with tourists . On a recent trip out of the Venice Marina , Beach took a National Wildlife Federation charter group to observe an oiled marsh , where they met up with MacDonald and other researchers from Florida State taking water samples where oil had managed to get past absorbent booms . The scientists hope the samples will provide clues to what the oil might do when it washes up on the coast of Florida . Beach said he is making the most of the temporary flood of business from the researchers . But he is not counting on it for long , nor is he savoring it . MacDonald is part of the Oil Spill Academic Task Force , a consortium of more than 200 scientists at 15 universities in Florida studying the disaster . The task force also has begun working informally with scientists in several other states , including Mississippi , Alabama and Louisiana , and might expand . `` This is so complicated and has so many dimensions . It will take a lot of science to figure out what is happening from a biological point of view , from an oceanographic point of view and from an economic point of view , '' said W. Ross Ellington , associate vice president for research at Florida State , where the task force is based .

The area becomes an important stopover point for many migratory birds . Slickened waters and fouled feeding grounds pose a danger during the migrations and underscore the wide reach of the damage , as Bridget Stutchbury points out . Stutchbury is a professor of biology at York Univeristy -LRB- Toronto -RRB- and author of The Private Lives of Birds : A Scientist Reveals the Intricacies of Avian Social Life , recently released by Walker & Co. . The heart-wrenching images of brown pelicans soaked in thick oil epitomize the ecological disaster unfolding in the Gulf , even more so considering that the brown pelican was taken off the endangered species list only a year ago . The Gulf Coast is teeming with breeding terns , plovers , herons and spoonbills that themselves were once threatened due to plundering by the millinery trade and DDT poisoning , but now are at enormous risk because of the oil accumulating on their feeding grounds and nesting colonies . As the oil snakes its way along the Florida coast and is forecast to turn the corner and head up the east coast , it is horrifying to consider the full extent of damage that may unfold . The ecological effects of the oil spill will extend into the Alaskan and Canadian arctic some three thousand miles away , as the crow flies , from the oil still pouring out of deepwater well head . Although the oil will not wash up on the arctic shoreline , migratory birds will soon be leaving their arctic breeding grounds to spend the winter along the Gulf Coast . Arctic breeding shorebirds such as the dunlin , whimbrel and western sandpiper converge on the rich feeding grounds along the coasts from Louisiana to Florida . Migratory birds throughout North America will be affected because the Gulf coast is a prime destination and vital crossroad for dozens of bird species . One of the first oil-covered birds to be cleaned up and released in early May was a northern gannet that should have been on its way north to a breeding colony on the Atlantic coast of Canada . The yellow rail , a secretive marsh bird that breeds in central Canada and the northern Great Plains , also winters in the coastal marshes of the Gulf . The diminutive piping plover , a threatened species , is now breeding on crowded beaches in the Northeast with the aid of beach patrols and fencing but despite these conservation efforts most will be living on polluted beaches along the Gulf this winter . Even migratory songbirds like thrushes , warblers , swallows , and orioles are not off the hook . By September and October songbirds that bred in places like Alberta , Minnesota , and Tennessee will be piling up by the millions in Gulf coast forests and wetlands to fuel up for their marathon flight across the Gulf of Mexico on their way to tropical climes . Many birds that depend on the Gulf coast are already experiencing severe population declines and the oil spill will only worsen their prospects . Oiling of feathers can kill birds outright , ingestion of contaminants makes them sick , and chemical exposure can have long term effects on reproduction and behavior . The scale of the oil spill is enormous , and for BP their responsibility extends to dozens of nations who share these migratory birds as a natural resource . By Steven E.

The government s own records show that since 1985 , more than 7 billion barrels of oil have been produced in federal offshore waters with less than 0.001 percent spilled a 99.999 % record for clean operations . That 35-year record of safety should not be ignored in the haste to respond to public discord . That 0.001 % has been a bit of a problem , has n't it ? The rest of the letter , slightly more convincing , is below the fold . I write to express my strong opposition to the U.S. Department of the Interior s six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . I am concerned that the decision to impose the moratorium is based more on emotion than fact . The Deepwater Horizon incident was a terrible human tragedy with devastating environmental consequences , but it must be viewed in the proper historical context as a statistical anomaly . The government s own records show that since 1985 , more than 7 billion barrels of oil have been produced in federal offshore waters with less than 0.001 percent spilled a 99.999 % record for clean operations . That 35-year record of safety should not be ignored in the haste to respond to public discord . Analysis from the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association shows the moratorium would put as many as 1,400 jobs per platform at risk , and lost wages could reach $ 10 million per month per platform and up to $ 330 million per month for all 33 platforms . Our economy is struggling mightily , and this drilling halt will adversely impact small businesses down the entire supply chain . The effect will extend far past the oil industry and be most damaging in the Gulf region , where a range of businesses from restaurants and cleaners to hardware stores and garages depend on a robust offshore industry . The Gulf Coast is already suffering from the emotional and physical trauma of the Deepwater Horizon incident , and this moratorium will only add financial trauma to their plight . According to the Minerals Management Service , 80 percent of the U.S. supply of oil developed offshore comes from deepwater drilling . That amount is projected to rise dramatically in the coming decades , and any moratorium on domestic production will only increase our dependence on foreign nations that are often hostile to America s interests . Adding to the volatility is the fact that transporting oil is extremely dangerous and poses a much more serious threat to our environment than drilling in U.S. waters . Further complicating matters is the current confusion over the Interior Department s freeze in approving any shallow water drilling permits . While I understand the Department has stated that such permits may go forward as soon as operators can demonstrate adoption of enhanced safety standards , the industry requires further clarification from the administration as to exactly what those standards will be . Companies will then need additional time to understand the changes and deploy new standards and technology to meet the requirements . I fear the delay equates to a de-facto moratorium on shallow water drilling , only adding to the economic uncertainty and instability in the Gulf region . These companies , their workers , and all Americans who depend on the energy they produce need swift action from the department to get back to work . I strongly encourage you not to punish the entire oil and gas industry because of any mistakes that were made on Deepwater Horizon . This shortsighted moratorium is harmful to America and our fragile economy , and it will mire domestic energy production in a confusing and ineffective bureaucracy . I implore you to lift the moratorium and allow responsible drilling off of our coasts to continue .

Look to the clouds . Oil pools along Barataria Bay on the Louisiana coast . The BP Gulf oil spill has become the most recent example of a '' Black Swan '' -- i.e. , an improbable , unpredicted event having tremendous impacts . Retrospective analysis might demonstrate the Deepwater Horizon explosion and resulting massive flow of oil into the Gulf was a relatively likely `` accident '' waiting to happen . Without benefit of hindsight , though , it 's been an event totally unanticipated with far-reaching consequences and one due to human failings , not an unavoidable natural disaster -LRB- e.g. , earthquake , hurricane -RRB- . Avoidable or not , we are in the position now of having to manage to the extent possible what heretofore was an unimaginable crisis . The ability to manage the crisis is dependent upon at least three fundamental questions : Exactly how much oil has spilled ? Where is the oil located ? And where will it go ? Unfortunately , there appears to be considerable uncertainty on answers to the first two questions , while the third is probably unanswerable beyond a few days in advance . A reasonable analogy is predicting the development and motion of a cloud where imperfect measurements of its dimensions , location and background wind field are magnified over time by imperfect forecast models . To extend this analogy consider the following ... Oil : A column of oil gushing from the bottom of the Gulf reaches the surface where it spreads out more or less uniformly as a thin sheen over an increasingly large area . Cloud : A plume of rising moist air reaches the level of condensation -LRB- beneath a stable layer of air that prevents it from rising further -RRB- where the newly formed cloud droplets spread out as a thin canopy over an increasingly large expanse of the sky . Oil : Over time , wind , waves and local surface currents begin to break up the oil into an array of congealed lumps of varying size and thickness . These lumps tend to spread apart and organize non-uniformly into clusters and long streaks -LRB- streamers -RRB- as functions of the variability in the strength and direction of surface winds and currents , surface wave characteristics -LRB- height , period , etc. -RRB- , degree of mixing with sea water , and vertical temperature and salinity structure of the underlying water column . Cloud : Over time , the stable layer of air destabilizes -LRB- allowing the moist air to penetrate higher -RRB- with the original thin cloud being replaced by puffy cumulus clouds of varying horizontal and vertical dimensions . The individual clouds tend to organize into cloud clusters and lines of clouds spreading across the sky non-uniformly as functions of the variability in the strength and direction of winds , degree of mixing between cloud and surrounding air , and vertical stability of the air mass . Oil : At least some oil will come ashore unexpectedly in the concentrated form of , for example , tar balls and mousse at the whim of winds , waves and currents . What might otherwise have been a great day for the beach or exploring the wetlands along the Gulf coast becomes a panicky rush to clean up and\\/or leave . Cloud : Some cloud clusters unexpectedly develop into thunderstorms at the whim of local atmospheric conditions . What otherwise was a great day to be outdoors becomes a panicky rush to pack up and seek cover . -LRB- I realize the analogy breaks down when considering that the long-term danger and after-effects of thunderstorms most certainly are not comparable to the long-term , massive , far-reaching impacts of the oil spill . But , please stay with me . -RRB- Oil : Eventually there is a good chance the oil spill will encounter the Loop Current , which would carry it and related consequences around -LRB- or between -RRB- the Florida Keys and be picked up by the Gulf Stream . Cloud : There 's a good chance the further development and motion of the cloud clusters will be governed by the jet stream , which propagates them and associated weather far beyond the area of initial development . A clean-up worker picks up blobs of oil in absorbent snare on Queen Bess Island at the mouth of Barataria Bay near the Gulf of Mexico in Plaquemines Parish . Predicting where the oil spill and its component parts will go is a challenge no less difficult , and probably even more difficult , than predicting clouds and overall weather conditions . Oil on the surface is moved by both winds and currents . Specialized computer models , such as those used to help produce NOAA 's oil trajectory maps , account for the influence of both by combining wind forecasts from weather models with current forecasts from ocean models . Not surprisingly , the predictability of oil spill movement is limited , since all weather and ocean models have errors that grow with time for a variety of reasons -LRB- e.g. , initial condition uncertainties , imperfect models -RRB- . Forecasts of near-surface winds are generally not reliable beyond several days ahead -LRB- say , a week or so -RRB- , as is true for all parameters within any weather forecast model , including those relevant to cloud development and motion . Even if winds were accurately predicted , wind-driven waves can disperse and spread the oil in directions that differ unpredictably from the wind . Moreover , observations are evidently lacking to precisely define the size and , especially , the small-scale structure of the oil spill . The latter is critical for predicting details of the location and timing of oil reaching vulnerable spots ashore -- not unlike difficulties in predicting the timing and location of thunderstorms . While wind and waves play a critical role in details of oil movement , it 's likely that large , strong currents that evolve relatively slowly over time , most notably the Loop Current and Gulf Stream , will ultimately govern how much of the oil is carried elsewhere from the Gulf . To the best of my knowledge ocean models , which suffer from an extreme scarcity of the observations necessary to define the initial ocean state and from imperfect representation of relevant dynamical and physical processes , have limited skill beyond a few days in predicting the evolution of such currents . The biggest threat in the shorter term is for the states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama . The oil could also spread as a function of changes in wind speed and direction eastward toward the west coast of Florida and\\/or westward to the Texas coast . Eventually , it 's not unlikely some oil will exit the Gulf of Mexico and move northward along the Atlantic coast and beyond . The least worst-case scenario would be for the oil to continue gushing into the Gulf for a prolonged period such that odds increase dramatically that all these areas would be affected . Even worse would be that the oil results in the Gulf of Mexico and much of the western Atlantic becoming dead zones for virtually all marine life . Presumably everything possible will be done to avoid such worst-cast disasters , but failure in these efforts and resulting catastrophic consequences are not outside the realm of possibilities . It 's a big Finite Element Analysis problem , and we have supercomputers that could render it and give a good stab at predicting where it goes - but only if we had the initial conditions and a good detailed map of all the changing ocean currents . I 'm not sure we have either of those things though ? It 's those pesky butterflies again . of course we 'll never be able to quantify ALL the variables . -LRB- like steve said ... damn butterflies ... -RRB- Posted by : walter-in-fallschurch | June 10 , 2010 9:19 PM | Report abuse Suppose we perfectly observe the full 3D system today , except that temperatures are only known to within a millionth of a degree . Suppose we also have giant computers and our models compute every physical process perfectly . Then as we forecast , that tiny temperature error will grow and compound itself so that there would be pretty much zero determinsitic predictability left beyond 30 days . Steve shows our actual predictability of the oil seems to be only on the order of a few days at best . But not all hope is lost . We can run an ensemble of model forecasts with a spread of initial conditions representing the observational uncertainty and a spread of different models representing the process uncertainty . The forecasts will diverge and give a `` spaghetti '' cloud of possible trajectories . So we can get useful probabilistic predictability beyond when single-valued deterministic forecasts fail . One of the pioneers of this ensemble technique is Steve Tracton . Relearn -LRB- learn -RRB- just how many perfidious acts BP has been caught out in so far ! Then ask yourself , `` why are we entrusting the fixing of this entire catastrophe to them ? '' BP is doing everything it can -LRB- so it tells us -RRB- to stem the humongous geyser of oil , gushing from the severed pipe , beneath what once was the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig in the Gulf of Mexico . The rig exploded and sank , on April 20 , 2010 killing 11 workers and injuring 17 others . here 's BPs response to another spill : Posted by : walter-in-fallschurch | June 11 , 2010 9:23 AM | Report abuse Dumping dirt -LRB- sand , clay and earth dirt contains large spectrum of bacteria -RRB- over the rising oil from the leaking pipe at the bottom of the gulf . My son Sami did not finish high school ; he won the trophy for the best martial art player in the province of Ontario . My son said that if he was working his car engine and his hand got dirty with oil and even if water and soap are available , my son prefers to use dirt from the ground -LRB- sand and clay -RRB- and rub his hand with the dirt . It is the best to remove oil from your hand . Why not dump load of ground dirt -LRB- soil consisting of sand and clay and earth dirt -RRB- onto the site where the oil is coming out from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . I mean 4 to 5 ship load every day . It is cheaper , Greener , and very effective . The rising crude oil will mix with the sand and dirt and settle to the bottom . It is confirmed that the under sea plumes are in anaerobic conditions -LRB- no oxygen -RRB- , and thus this will be a heaven for anaerobic bacteria that can in the absence of oxygen eat everything s and a good source of these bacteria comes from dirt . Later when the rising oil leak will be stopped , the mixture of sand and oil can be vacuumed from the bottom and treated accordingly . Accounting for uncertainty in any forecast is essential to convey all relevant information . If you go to the NOAA trajectory site referenced , you 'll see that these precitictions are ensemble forecasts - note uncertainty boundary in forecast charts . But , the reliability of ensemble predictions -LRB- probabilities -RRB- is limited by model capabilities and ensemble strategy . An ensemble can not provide useful information on what the model can not predict . Kick is the cause of the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico . President Obama is right when he said `` We talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers , so I know whose ass to kick '' . The word Kick is very scientific because the reason for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a Kick . It is well known in the oil industry and the oil companies are well aware that : When drilling in oil and gas-bearing formations submerged in deep water , the reservoir gas -LRB- mainly methane -RRB- may flow into the well bore and form gas hydrates due to the low temperatures and high pressures found during deep water drilling -LRB- similar to the situation in the Deep water Horizon Oil Spill -RRB- . The gas hydrates may then flow upward with drilling mud or other discharged fluids . As they rise , the pressure in the drill string decreases and the hydrates dissociate into gas and water . The rapid gas expansion ejects fluid from the well , reducing the pressure further , which leads to more hydrate dissociation and further fluid ejection . The resulting violent expulsion of fluid from the drill string is referred to as a `` kick '' -LRB- see . Petroleum Science 6 : 57-63 , 2009 -RRB- . This could possibly be the reason for the accidents which caused the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Thus president Obama had indirectly identified the culprit that caused the oil spill . Now that the oil spill is her and it is continuing to spread everywhere and reach regions that are very sensitive ecologically we are faced with a disaster . But let us look at the good thing about the oil spill . This disaster actually was one good driving force for evolution . For example the oil that we use as energy comes from the dinosaurs that vanished for unknown reasons and decomposed below the ground to give us oil . This oil drives our car , make all kind of plastic and keep our house warm . The vanishing of dinosaurs was a disaster similar to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . This disaster will be the driving force for evolution since the spreading oil in the marine environment will produce a new species more resistant to toxic chemicals and kill the weak species while the strong more resistant species will propagate . The oil spill can be considered as a vaccine to the marine ecosystem . This is because a vaccine is basically the bacteria of the disease injected to the human body to produce resistance against the disease . It took every shortcut possible to save time and money with clear knowledge that there was a non zero chance of the disaster we now see unfolding . BP gambled and WE lost . To me this is no different when some hot-shot knowingly runs a red light to meet some perceived deadline that might add to his\\/her bottom line and kills some innocent victim in the process . That too is not an accident , but a criminal act . i would LOVE to see it , but i doubt it will happen . 21 of his book `` I.T. WARS '' is a real eye-opener too . A relevant and exceedingly important quote from it is worth posting here : '' In looking at certain outcomes from disasters , we can recognize that prevention is not some part of a Disaster Recovery Plan , or Business Continuity Plan it is the goal and the whole of it . To further illustrate what we mean : During the Cold War between the old Soviet Union and the U.S. , a defacto policy of MAD - Mutually Assured Destruction - held a nuclear exchange and total destruction at bay . There s not likely much of a recovery plan post-apocalypse . Prevention was the goal and indeed whole of the plan the great driving motivator that influenced all subsequent activity . '' Though a dramatic example , for some things mankind has control over , the consequences of mishaps through accident , misjudgment , benign or criminal neglect , avoiding dire consequences must be - the sole overriding criteria for guiding action - even if that requires hard and fast - and enforceable and enforced - government regulations . read a description and see a drawing of my new idea in my article latest update : Posted by : www999 | June 13 , 2010 3:39 AM | Report abuse The comments to this entry are closed .

Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , head of the government 's spill response , said that BP collected 15,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 630,000 gallons -RRB- from the blown well on Tuesday but that significantly more was escaping the containment cap into the ocean . Allen said the company is moving a `` mobile drilling unit '' to the site that will increase the receiving capacity to 28,000 barrels -LRB- almost 1.2 million gallons -RRB- a day . The quantity of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico has been the subject of speculation and controversy for weeks . Early in the crisis , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued an estimate of 210,000 gallons a day , but more recently a government-appointed team of scientists known as the Flow Rate Technical Group produced estimates of 504,000 to 1.05 million gallons . Because the damages and penalties that could be levied against BP would be based on the amount of oil released into the gulf , investors interpreted Wednesday 's news as substantially increasing the company 's potential liability . Allen also said Wednesday that the 1,000-foot shuttle tanker Loch Rannoch was headed to the gulf from the North Sea . The tanker is capable of withstanding rougher seas than the ships currently in place at the crowded blowout site . Along the Gulf Coast , the damage to wildlife is becoming more apparent . A rescue center in Louisiana said it has gotten more than five times as many oily birds in the past few days than in the previous six weeks . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 's rescue center in coastal Louisiana has reported a little more than 400 birds since the BP well blew out April 20 . Of those , 350 were brought in since Thursday . Since the Deepwater Horizon explosion , BP 's stock price has dropped by more than 50 percent . Wednesday 's decline was attributed to both the amount of oil flowing from the well and comments from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar that the Obama administration will ask BP to repay the salaries of workers laid off because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater exploratory drilling . Phil Weiss , an oil analyst with Argus Research in New York , said momentum is working against BP as the news gets progressively worse despite the increased capture of oil . He said he thinks the company can survive , `` but there 's more doubt in my mind than there was a week ago . Momentum is a powerful thing . '' Concerns have also grown that BP will have to suspend its dividend payment under pressure from U.S. lawmakers who say the money should go toward paying legal claims and for environmental repair in the gulf . In the past two days , seven analysts have cut their expectations on the likely payout , giving more reason to sell the stock . Although officials of the administration and BP communicate every day , President Obama told NBC 's Matt Lauer Tuesday that he has not spoken directly with company chief executive Tony Hayward . He told Lauer he expected that Hayward would just tell him what he wanted to hear -- an explanation that was revised Wednesday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs . The spokesman said that Hayward had no independent authority and that decisions are made by the board of directors and its chairman .

But most Americans now want fewer offshore wells -LRB- 31 percent -RRB- or the amount kept at current levels -LRB- 41 percent -RRB- . Perhaps as a consequence of the spill , public support for oil and gas drilling in general is also significantly lower than it was a year ago . And as Americans have become increasingly skeptical about such exploration , some elected representatives are now questioning what the government is doing to ensure that offshore exploration can take place safely . On Wednesday during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing , the panel 's chairman , Jeff Bingaman -LRB- D-N.M. -RRB- , said the gulf oil spill underscores a failure of both BP and the federal government . `` It 's clear that prior to the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig neither the companies involved nor the government adequately appreciated or prepared for the risks involved in a deep-water drilling operation of this type , '' Bingaman said . The new Post-ABC poll reveals a widespread perception that poor federal regulation was at fault in the gulf spill . About 63 percent point a finger at inadequate enforcement of regulations , and 55 percent see an overall weak regulatory structure . Even more , 73 percent , blame BP and its drilling partners for the accident . And the same number are calling the spill a major environmental disaster . In an interview Wednesday , House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall -LRB- D-W . Va. -RRB- said it sometimes `` takes a tragedy of these proportions '' to provide the political will to impose stricter federal rules on energy exploration . The broad concern about government inaction directly relates to public support for new drilling : Those who see a weak regulatory structure as a reason for the spill are about twice as likely to want to curb offshore drilling than are those who do n't see the need for stricter federal controls . About half of the poll respondents , 49 percent , now see the gulf spill as part of a broader problem with such drilling . Support for drilling in general has slipped from 64 percent last August to 52 percent now . The Post-ABC poll was conducted June 3 to 6 , among a random national sample of 1,004 adults . The results from the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .

Send us an e-mail . President , Shell Oil ; Founder and CEO , Citizens for Affordable Energy , Inc. . Friday , June 11 , 2010 ; 11:00 AM Arlington , Va. : I heard you basically say on a news show that the reason we are drilling in deep and ultradeep water is because we do n't allow drilling on the beaches and some federal lands . Do you believe this ? That we could ban forever all deep and ultra deepwater drilling and supply all our needs -LRB- 20 + million barrels\\/day -RRB- with unrestricted drilling on beaches and Federal lands ? Sun Prairie , Wisc. : Good morning , Mr. Hofmeister . Could you comment on the involvement of oil companies other than BP in the attempts to stop the runaway well spewing more money into the Gulf of Mexico , and in the effort to clean up oil already in the Gulf and monitor its effects ? Are Exxon and other oil companies involved at all , or are they bystanders ? Do they possess expertise BP does not , or resources that might help if put to use ? John Hofmeister : BP early on invited the major oil companies and experts from universities , consulting firms and think tanks to get inovled . They assembled in the crisis center in Houston and have been working on the technical aspects of this since then . Although they have yet to succeed in stopping the flow the engineering and ideas are the best we have in the world . Newport News , Va. : Mr. Hofmeister : President Obama , according to many , ca n't seem to do anything right re : the spill . In your mind , what could the administration have done differently and better that would have had a marked effect on the recovery effort so far ? John Hofmeister : In my opinion the White House and the President should have gotten up close to the tragedy from day one and been a part of the team at the outset . Instead they held back and jumped in when things were n't going well , as if they had better ideas . Then it all got politicized very quickly when the rhetoric and bullying started in earnest in response to increasingly loud complaints . Quiet and intense conversation between the key parties is preferable to shouting out loud and `` kicking ass . '' The White House went public to embarass BP and went over the top by shutting down perfectly safe drilling rigs across the deepwater . It chose to not even talk with the BP CEO . You have to talk to people to solve problems . Washington , D.C. : I do n't understand why we should drill more in the U.S. Eventually , the world is going to start to run out and it is better to not have depleted all our reserves in the meantime . Peaks Island , Maine : Do you agree with members of the Flow Rate Technical Group that BP stonewalled the group 's request for the likes of high resolution video data ? Washington , D.C. : No offense but do n't you think the reason people are not listening to your ideas about a flotilla of supertankers sucking up oil is because , like Tony Hayward , they presume you have some financial motivation to say what you are saying ? BTW , do you ? Fort Myers , Flka . : Can you explain why deep water drilling is allowed without proven safety measures in place ? I understand the difficulty in capping the leak at that depth , but did n't one of our brilliant scientific minds point this out before these rigs were built ? John Hofmeister : For forty years and for over 35000 wells in the Gulf of Mexico the proven safety measure has been the blow out protector . It is also the device used around the world . Something went wrong with the blow out protector and we need to get to the bottom of it and hold people accountable . It should have worked . Tucson , Ariz. : Assuming that much of the oil tainting delicate marshlands or mangroves can not be cleaned up , do we know how long it will take these ecosystems to recover on their own ? or , are they perhaps changed forever ? John Hofmeister : It will take years , several growing seasons , for the biosphere to adapt and adjust , provided it is not further damaged in the meantime . The warm climate and warm water actually will help restoration , unlike cold water and cold weather in Alaska . Aberdeen , S.D. : Would it be possible to equip fishing , larger cargo type ships and or naval ships with portable oil water separtion devices to start remediating the slicks in-situ ? New York , N.Y. : What should the federal government 's role be in the current gulf oil spill ? They seem to be inflaming and delaying rather than doing anything useful . John Hofmeister : The federal government does a good job of analyzing and regulating . It does a consistently poor job of operating and executing . Laurel , Md. : How much easier would the spill have been to cap if the rig had n't been in such deep water ? Is there any compelling reason that deep-water drilling is preferable to shallow ? John Hofmeister : Deep water drilling is inherently more risky and costly than shallow water drilling . In the western Gulf of Mexico more than 35000 wells have been safely drilled , including over 2200 deep water wells . Peaks Island , Maine : What grade would you give Adm. Allen on his descriptions of the process for stopping the flow ? For his explanations of the leak rate determinations and the importance thereof ? Fairfax , Va. : What changes do you envision for the Minerals Management Service in the coming months and years ? Salazar has recommended an agency shake-up , but it appears that MMS needs more -- not less -- staff power and funding . John Hofmeister : It 's still too soon to say . I disagree with the characterization that the industry and MMS were `` too cozy . '' That was not my experience . Perhaps some people tried to get friendly with the government . I never saw it that way . They have a job to do ; so does the industry . Their job is to regulate and govern ; the industry is to produce . Between the two parties it promotes reliability and accountability . Yuma , Ariz. : What are the chances that the well casing below the sea floor has been compromised , and that gas and oil are coming up the outside of the well casing , eroding the surrounding soft rock . Could this lead to a catastrophic geological failure , unstoppable even by the relief wells ? John Hofmeister : This is what some people fear has occurred . It is also why the `` top kill '' process was halted . If the casing is compromised the well is that much more difficult to shut down , including the risk that the relief wells may not be enough . If the relief wells do not result in stopping the flow , the next and drastic step is to implode the well on top of itself , which carries other risks as well . Harrisburg , Pa. : Scientific research can shown that algae produces far more energy resources than does cane sugar , corn , or drilled oil . What is being done about researching the creation of algae to energy plants ? Why does the Federal government not allow grants for new energy resources for algae ? I read one company is looking into this . Why are n't the other companies looking into this , and what is taking so long to duplicate what underfinanced scientists are able to do in small laboratories ? Algae could be the safest and most productive energy source available . Bethesda , Md. : Would you say the best minds are occupied with finding a way to cap the oil , but no one is minding the business of the execution such as making sure the booms are well placed , and frequently replaced when they have satured ? One can obviously see the booms method of cleaning is not working . John Hofmeister : You characterize it as I do . The scientists and engineers are primarily focused on the well . Arlington , Va. : You say something went wrong with the BOP , which may be true -- but is n't it also likely that the well casing was compromised within 1000 ' of the seabed and that even if the BOP sealed the head shut , the hydrocarbons would be spewing out down well and migrating to the surface ? New Orleans , La. : Why is shallower drilling safer ? I have followed the BP inquest and story closely . It appears that a bad job of cementing , poorly tested , combined with a very poor design for casing and cutting corners on time resulted in this disaster . I can see the exact same problems happening in 400 ' of water . And with a probable fractured casing , the only solution is a successful relief well , on land , in 12 ' or water or 5,000 ' of water . So why is shallow drilling safer ? Bethesda , Md. : You mean is the government 's decision to use burning , dispersing , booming and skimming ? It is not BP 's decision ? Leesburg , Fla. : Can the U.S. demand an escrow fund from BP to ensure all damaged get paid before BP goes broke ... get some\\/a lot of that cash now ? If not why not ? Springfield , Va. : How often has a blowout preventer been called into use ? And how many times has it worked ? The BOP in the Ixtoc spill from decades ago did not work , hence the massive spill then . John Hofmeister : That accident was worse than this one . It led to much improvement in the design and effectiveness of blow out preventors . The one at this well seems to have been re-designed and then damaged . We need to find out the whole story before we declare the prodct insufficient for our purposes . Anonymous : I have heard that The Jones act is preventing us accepting help in skimming the oil up . Could you please tell us about that Arlington , Va. : You have complained that the administration is showing `` anti hydrocarbon tendencies '' . Why is this a bad thing ?

Scientists put every one of those numbers in play Thursday as they struggled to come up with a solid estimate of how much oil is gushing each day from the black geyser at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . The one scientific certainty : It 's a lot -- and more than some of the same scientists thought just a couple of weeks ago . It 's so much that the crews trying to siphon it to the surface are going to need a bigger boat . Early in the crisis , BP and the federal government repeatedly said that the Deepwater Horizon well was spewing about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- a day into the gulf . But the new estimates , released Thursday by government-appointed scientists , show that the well most likely produces 5,000 barrels before breakfast . One team that has studied video taken of the leaking riser pipe before it was cut and capped last week has concluded that the well was most likely producing 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day . If that estimate is on target , and if the flow has been more or less consistent since the April 20 blowout , the hydrocarbon reservoir 21\\/2 miles below the sea floor has gushed five to six times the amount spilled in Alaskan waters in 1989 by the Exxon Valdez . Put it another way : It 's roughly one Valdez spill every week . Nearly two Olympic-size swimming pools of oil every day . Another scientific team , which analyzed satellite images , has come up with a somewhat more modest estimate of 12,600 to 21,500 barrels a day , just a slight uptick from the team 's earlier finding . Or the flow could be much higher still : A team led by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has studied the leak with instruments normally used in research on deep-sea hydrothermal vents . Its initial estimate puts the flow at 25,000 to 50,000 barrels a day , said U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt , who leads the teams of scientists collectively known as the Flow Rate Technical Group . `` These numbers are all over the board , '' she said in a conference call with reporters . In response to a question , McNutt said that 20,000 to 40,000 barrels is the most plausible range , but she emphasized that the findings are preliminary and that the techniques have inherent limitations . The flow rate is significant on several fronts . First , it gives the government and BP a sense of how much capacity they 'll need among surface ships to handle all the oil gushing out of the well and up a pipe to the Discoverer Enterprise drill ship , which is capable of processing about 18,000 barrels a day . Other ships are being added to the effort . Second , the fines that BP faces for polluting the gulf will be tied to how much oil has leaked . Third , the higher figures call into question the circumstances that led to the much lower estimates of the spill early in the crisis . On April 28 , after having received estimates of the size of the spill from BP and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the Coast Guard announced the 5,000-barrels-a-day estimate . Not until May 27 did the flow rate group increase the estimate to 12,000 to 25,000 barrels .

Charlie Melancon moved to tears by gulf spill GRAND ISLE , LA. . -- Great globs of oil are churning in the surf . Muck-covered pelicans sit offshore , white only in their eyes . Here -- in a beach town living its nightmare -- Rep. Charlie Melancon -LRB- D -RRB- gets up at a community meeting . He does whatever is the opposite of grandstanding : He explains what he ca n't do to help . `` I , like you , am just feeling so helpless that there 's a hole out there , '' Melancon says to the crowd , filling the compact First Baptist Church . `` Until we get that hole stopped , we 're all in peril . '' For all the politicians bogged down in the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , this is the essential dilemma : How does one look effective while actually flailing ? No politician can stop the spill ; that will be done , if ever , by corporate submersibles at the bottom of the gulf . The problem is inside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government but physically outside its reach . All that frustration pushed President Obama this week to start working blue : He said he was trying to decide `` whose ass to kick . '' The real personification of the leak 's political story -- of its ability to make power feel useless -- is Melancon , a junior congressman whose coastal district has taken the brunt of the spill . Melancon is known as a man who makes things move in south Louisiana . But in this crisis , his most prominent act was last month , when he broke down and cried in front of colleagues and TV cameras at a subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill . `` I have problems because it 's not a tangible . It 's a hole in the ocean , '' he said , calm and composed in a recent interview . That hole , plus his heated Senate bid to unseat a GOP incumbent , have restricted his abilities to play congressman : to fix problems , or gripe at those who do n't . `` The hard part is ... , '' Melancon said , pausing to sum up his problem , '' ... what can I do ? '' Melancon -LRB- pronounced `` Meh-LAW-sawn '' -RRB- is 62 -- a square-faced man with a medium-grade Cajun accent and a career hugging the political center . He grew up in small-town Napoleonville and served his political apprenticeship as an aide to former governor Edwin Edwards -LRB- D -RRB- . Melancon met his wife , Peachy , working on Edwards 's campaign . The couple visited their old boss in Oakdale federal prison just two months ago . Melancon served in the state legislature and was president of the American Sugar Cane League . He entered Congress in 2005 , in time to have his career defined by the Bayou State 's catastrophes . Four recent hurricanes have hit Melancon 's swampy , French-inflected district in the toe of Louisiana 's boot . `` Katrina , Rita , Gustav and Ike '' -- people say here , rattling them off like bad relatives . Katrina was the last time Melancon cracked : In an emotional outburst after weeks of little sleep , he made members of the Democratic Caucus watch a video of scenes of New Orleans 's devastation .

Weeks spent clearing brush back at the ranch in Hyde Park might be pushing it . But an afternoon on the back nine doesn t bother me . And whenever Obama does take a few hours off , there will always be enough going on in the world against which to juxtapose his leisure to enable the Jim Hofts of the Internet to take their cheap shots . It was unfair when Michael Moore did this to George W. Bush . And it s unfair for Hoft to do it to Barack Obama . Of course , the president might have expected this after comparing the oil spill to 9\\/11 . His point -- that the spill will change the way Americans view relevant national policies -- is fair enough . But even in drawing a more apt analogy to the tragedy of 2001 , invoking that loaded pair of numbers practically invites rhetorical excess . What people fail to realize is that the Office of the President is no only in the Oval Office . It is where ever the President is ... Even on the golf course . If a President were not allow to rest until their are no crisis they would die of exhaustion . Let me add another one of Dick Cheney 's most famous words ... Mr. Hoft . . `` Go F@@@ Yourself '' Posted by : cavys | June 14 , 2010 12:48 PM | Report abuse From Day one , he has golfed . He does n't make any meaningful decisions anyway ! If gets the skimmer operation going that should have started weeks ago I do n't care if he goes on a month long cruise ! The problem is delegation ... he does n't know how to do it ! Get some stinking people in there and start working ! You have to concluded that the Obama Administration sabotage this catastrophe and allowed this to happen , to garner public outrage at oil use and assist in passing their STUPID Cap & Tax idea ! Then , he is n't hatching new leftist plots against our Constitution . That certainly is ... an opinion . He works his pointing finger to the bone . Who will he be pointing it at today ? Has he been told yet whose ass he 's supposed to kick ? September 11th was like Pearl Harbor , a day that defined the US and history for an entire generation . Perhaps the oil spill is something that will define the next generation 's commitment to protecting the environment the way we are committed to national security . However it seems that we have a propensity as Americans to fall in love with our political candidates when we elect them and then destroy them when they assume office . This seems sad to me . I have had leadership positions and know what the support of those I worked with meant to me . Has it really only been two short years since his prescient statements about the environment ? `` This was the moment when the gasoline odor of the oceans began to rise and our planet began to be blanketed in a thick , tar-like ooze ; this was the moment when we ended a war or maybe just continued it and a couple of others , and secured our nation and restored our image as the last , best hope on Earth to be led by terrible golfer who likes to insult the Special Olympics . '' -- Barack Obama , June 2008 Posted by : zippyspeed | June 14 , 2010 3:08 PM | Report abuse This well is 50 miles off the coast , and the fact that the federal government did n't use it 's international resources to get equipment to the area and collect spillage by skimming it off the top of water is great failure and gross negligence ! You have to concluded that the Obama Administration sabotage this catastrophe and allowed this to happen , to garner public outrage at oil use and assist in passing their STUPID Cap & Tax idea ! Is n't this an industrial accident ? Are n't the companies that cause industrial accidents responsible for the clean up ? The media continues its love affair . I do know it has not commented on the many vacations our current president has taken this year -LRB- Hawaii , North Carolina , Chicago , Camp David -RRB- along with numerous -LRB- not one -RRB- rounds of golf . I do n't disagree that a president needs some time of his own , but I tire of the hypocrisy of the press . There has to be something out here he 's good at . And he might as well enjoy doing it . Before the American voter takes away his presidential golf club bag , cart , and secret service caddys . Two and a half years from now . You have to concluded that the Obama Administration sabotage this catastrophe and allowed this to happen , to garner public outrage at oil use and assist in passing their STUPID Cap & Tax idea ! I 'm in no way instituting , that the government pays the cost or does n't collect it in the future . If a tanker of oil crashes and spills on the highway , the local government is prepared to send Haz-Mat crews to clean-up and bring health and safety . The owner of that tanker will still bear the cost ! The folks who are on the job and have something useful to do do n't have to drop what they are doing and take Obama 's calls just so Obama can look like he 's on top of it . At least Obama did n't promise not to play golf until the last drop was cleaned up and then go play anyway . That was the problem with Bush playing after promising not to -LRB- which was a silly thing to do in the first place -RRB- . does n't WaPo EVER get tired of carrying Obozo 's water ?? I mean ever ?? Posted by : morphy | June 14 , 2010 4:04 PM | Report abuse I think he should play golf all day , every day -- dawn to dusk . Watch sports all evening , smoke his last doobie of the day and go to bed . This should be his daily routine till November 2012 . The `` We ` reSickOfYou '' oath : Do no more harm . His vacations taken and personal time off are astonishing . As a comparison , I run my own business . Usually , that 's 7 days a week -- at least 10-12 hours per day , crises all the time to keep things going , and one massive headache after another . I chose this to be my life . Have n't had a vacation in years -- certainly no golfing , trips to the theater in New York , and so on . Obama chose to run for President . It would be good if he did the job before taking all the perks . Get rid of this guy and let 's really MoveOn . I understand that he keeps his total score versus multi-mulligan , pencil whipping Clinton . Obama 's score must be in the high triple digits . He must truly enjoy whacking at a ball several hundred times in four or five hours , but please do n't try and convince us that he needs the downtime because scheming to destroy our country is n't that tough for a socialist . `` Obama is not a hard-working man His vacations taken and per sonal time off are astounding '' ... no true . Matter of fact the award for most time taken goes to George W. Bush ... a total of 548 days while in office . That 's almost two years vacation . Obama will never match Dubya 's vacations . He 's a freemason , a member of the Illuminati , and a puppet of the dread OWO-sponsored foreign relations council . What 's worse , you probably remember how the rumor about McCain having a black child sank his presidential chances back in 2000 in S. Carolina , right ? Well , Barack Obama has TWO black children , and research shows that he openly admits that they 're his , but that he is a mongrel himself and not ashamed to admit it . A BOOGIE IN THE WHITE HOUSE ! Whhaaaa ... whaaaaa Posted by : roblimo | June 14 , 2010 4:57 PM | Report abuse Where were all you wise-a $ $ es when Bush was golfing , cutting wood and ruining the country ? I guess Obama is supposed to work 24\\/7 even though Bush spent MOST of his term on vacation . You racist folk are such haters that if Obama walked on water , you 'd complain that he got his feet wet . Give it a rest , will ya !!!!!!!!!!!!! Posted by : Osupport | June 14 , 2010 5:03 PM | Report abuse As a comparison , I run my own business .

Have n't had a vacation in years -- certainly no golfing , trips to the theater in New York , and so on . Obama chose to run for President . It would be good if he did the job before taking all the perks . Get rid of this guy and let 's really MoveOn . It would be really good if he had a real job before running . I recall reading that President Eisenhower golfed all the time . However , since no one questioned his competence no one objected to him hitting the course . Is he going to kick some ass ? Or does he only kick friendly companies Asses and use diplomacy with non-allies ? He should lift the Jones Act to allow ships to help with the clean up of the Gulf that do not have Union crews . Many countries have offered help but can not travel intercoastally because of that protection for our Unions . It 's the 24\\/7 news cycle that is causing all of this consternation and impatience with the public . People do n't seem to have any patience anymore - want an instant fix for everything . He has done nothing but spend , blame , spend , spend , blame , whine , golf , vacation , whine , spend , golf , basketball , golf , golf , golf , vacation , golf , spend , whine , vacation , blame and golf since he took office . He has golfed more in 17 months than Bush did in 8 years . He has also outspent Bush , and everyother president combined . But what can you expect from an inexperienced loser like Obama who has never had a real job in his worthless life ? But that does n't make him a good golfer by any means . If he really knew how to play the game of golf , he would have invited the Consul General of the Netherlands to golf with him and conduct a little business -- like accepting the Netherland government 's offer of sending ships outfitted with more efficient skimmers to America 's Gulf Coast . Instead , Obama chose to go it alone and kick his ball out of the sand trap ! According to Obama today -LRB- in a comment that has been willfully ignored by much of the American media -RRB- , this spill `` echoes '' 9\\/11 , and much as 9\\/11 caused us to rethink our security policy , this spill will rewrite our energy policy . Some problems with this present themselves , however . 9\\/11 was not an accident . It was carried out by people who intentionally wanted to destroy the U.S. , or at least part of our country . Is BP now the new Al Qaeda ? Is the entire oil industry now turned into environmental terrorists ? Or , conversely , is Obama saying that much as this spill was an accident caused by oversight in regulation and greed for oil and profits , that 9\\/11 was basically the same ? Even more importantly , what about the thousands who died on 9\\/11 ? Are their deaths now weighed equally with the damaged incomes and lost wildlife in the Gulf ? Obama can play down his comment by arguing not to take the analogy to far , and that he did n't mean it in these ways , but this becomes a weak excuse for a comment that probably should not have been made . Of course , from the lack of reporting in the Washington Post and elsewhere , it 's almost like the comment was never made . Heck , even Media Matters issued a statement backing up Obama on the comments , and yet in the mainstream media ... crickets chirping . Why not write about a President `` of the people and for the people '' playing more golf in his 1.5 years of office than George Bush played in 8-years . Smells to me more like bourgeois than someone capable of empathizing with the unemployed , small business owners or fishermen in the Gulf . The alien lizard people of Sirius V had a President who dithered away most of his term playing intergalactic billiards , and then he went out for a long lunch break and never came back -LRB- his official portrait says `` missing - presumed fed '' -RRB- . Obama is even worse than that . Worst President in the local Galaxy cluster and the first ten dimensions -LRB- the 11th dimension , well we wo n't get into that -RRB- . And that 's not hyperbole , never in the history of the universe have Obama 's critics used hyperbole ; -RRB- Posted by : leftcoaster | June 14 , 2010 6:03 PM | Report abuse Posted by : pressF1 | June 14 , 2010 6:04 PM | Report abuse By god but you Yanks are crazy !?! In what way can the American President be held responsible for BP fouling the gulf waters ? How stupid do you guys think you look to the rest of the world ? -LRB- I 'll give you a hint - currently in Australia slime mould has a better PR status than does the American Republican Party . -RRB- Even the lack of controls guiding this disastrous venture are all down to the `` drill baby drill '' mob who occupied the white house prior to Obama s residence . Fr ` crissakes the well was started at about the same time as he was sworn in ! But from the outside looking in all that is visible is this crazy debate about President Obama being angry , or not being angry enough or , . . How stupid do you right wingers look ? What would you have the president do ? Just nip back in time and stop the Republicans from selling the environment to the highest bidder ? or Nationalize the oil industry ? or Walk out across the gulf and plug the hole with his finger ? The Republican Party might not realize it yet but this will be the last nail in their coffin . Even the US public will look back on the events of the last 60 odd days and will be unable to stomach the raw hypocrisy . The president lives at work . No matter where the president is , the job is with him . He can issue an executive order from the oval office or even the golf course . To complain if the president takes a few hours to do something he may find relaxing is petty . The job never goes away . George W. Bush took more vacations than any president in history . This president is far behind Bush in vacation days thus far and would have to do a whole lot of vacationing to catch up . In case no one noticed , every president that takes office may go in looking youthful , but will come out gray haired and much older . You can already see the age the office has added to President Obama . If he gets some enjoyment and stress relief from basketball and golf , you should be glad . I would think a stressed individual would have a greater chance of making a poor decision than a more relaxed one . This record will take some time to accumulate and disseminate , but it will be known . Obama 's every meeting , phone-call , social event , ball game , and vacation are on record . And this record will sink this president 's vaunted presidency , as it should . This chapter in American history will be titled , `` Asleep at the Wheel for almost two months . '' When he 's on the golf course he is not screwing up the economy , bowing and scraping to foreign potentates , making like he 's not in bed with BP and the oil lobbyists , or spinning more untruths about the healthcare plan that will save us all . Just remember what the moron said ... that the oil spill was the same as the 9\\/11 terrorist attacks that killed 3,000 + Americans . Several of the enlisted men I have spoken to said they did not get a chance to play . Maybe the generals ... Posted by : charlesalaska | June 14 , 2010 8:03 PM | Report abuse Barry the incompetent boob Obama has already sent as many American soldiers to their deaths in Afghanistan -- 475 -- as were lost during the first seven years of the war , 2001-2007 . Barry the inept bungler has only been president for 16 months . George W. Bush gave up golfing forever during the Iraq war , he did not want to ever create a situation for some mother to learn her son was killed while the president was golfing . I agree with Stromberg that this is a cheap shot at Obama , but it 's his own fault . Comparing this to 9\\/11 and stressing the urgency then hitting the back nine looks like he 's just another politician talking through both sides of his mouth . Some have brought up President Bush at his Crawford ranch . He did work there ; he met with heads of state and the cabinet reported to him there . Bush was n't escaping the job , he was escaping Washington . The guy seems like he 's never worked an honest day in his life . I 'd like to see him clearing brush for 2 days . He 'd probably hire an illegal to do it for him . But we got what we voted for . Jimmy Carter II . . Obama has to entertain himself since he has no real world experience outside the fact that he ran Acorn . . and you know the dishonest creeps that worked for that organization . Simply shamless ... Posted by : surfer1104 | June 14 , 2010 9:28 PM | Report abuse Its still hard to believe the magnitude of this oil spill . Maybe a round of golf will allow Barack to relieve the stress of a country run by greedy corporations caring less about the environment . I am outraged at his indifference and his lack of leadership . Maybe it is better he play golf since all he thinks he needs to do is blackmail this private company to set up this slush fund . Spacey as this administration seems to be , they still have not made any moves to clean this spill up . They want to milk this crisis for all its worth but from the anger I see expressed from my little sphere of reference , their goose is cooked . It really does not matter what he does anymore . He will be a one term President . There is no correlation to be made between the two events . Please explain again why Obama is supposed to be so intelligent . Did you see him golfing , playing basketball , partying weekly PRIOR to becoming POTUS . Nothing in his biography up to and including being a State Senator that said he spent HIS MONEY of all the partying , golfing , traveling around for one hour Photo Ops and etc. . However , it is well documented that the were more than willing to attend events WHEN THEY DID NOT PAY A DIME . Once he became POTUS ... it is as if they became King and Queen . Only the BEST for the First Black POTUS . His lack of concern , his lack of leadership , his total disregard for American Citizens has never been more evident than during the last 66 days . . He had the opportunity to LED . . but instead he sat on the Porch and let the leaders take care of the spill . No none can be faulted for the failure of the oil well EXCEPT for those who constructed the rig . Obama AND ALL those on the Hill can be faulted for dithering , and placing blame instead of attacking the oil spill from day one . The time to stop\\/reduce the oil flow onto our beaches into our marshes ... was withing 72 hours after the explosion . Obama has yet to mobilize his power to STOP the arrival of oil onto our coast lines . . That was his responsibility . He failed and continues to be guilty of High Crimes and Treason Against the Constitution and the Citizens of the United States . Excuse me ... I forgot the Constitution does not apply to Obama ... because he is a Dual Citizen and not a Natural Born Citizen . . It 's like something crawling out of a sewer . Tomorrow evening our President will talk to the nation about the situation in the gulf , and I hope everyone listens to it with an open mind . You may not agree with or approve of everything he says , but at least you 'll know what he said , the whole context , rather than a snippet or two featured by some commentator , who then tells you his opinion . There are too many comments that display ignorance of the events and the President 's handling of the crisis to date . Let 's all inhale slowly and review the facts - The US gov ' t did n't cause this spill , BP did - focus the anger towards them . God knows they earned it . If President Obama had directed gov ' t resources to clean up the mess the same idiots that are decrying him now would be screaming that he is bailing out a corporate giant . Give it a rest fellas . Obama 's problem is pure and simply that he has forgotten that perception is reality and that he is perceived as putting fundraising , listening to Paul warble through yet another silly love song and long weekends ahead of the salvage operation . You can be sure that a lot of lower people were working on this problem out of sight of cameras . Sadly , Obama performing as Nero took center stage . Well apparently now that the President is a Democrat , he is only human and can only do so much . The left in this country and the media have themselves to blame for the unreasonable expectations and disdain for this president . After all it was the constant criticism of Bush that anything and everything was his fault . Add in the wonder of Obama 's specialness and it is hardly a surprise that people expected so much . Some of us , however are not surprised or disappointed by his failure to perform even competently , much less miracles . In 2002 - we got editorial after article about Bush playing too much golf when he should have been working on addressing a spate of suicide bombings in Israel . Obama has played more golf in 2 years than Bush in 8 and we have a huge disaster threatening industries and livelihoods of Americans in the Gulf of Mexico . And the Post says `` who cares '' . Please never again try to argue that the Washington Post is not biased to the left . We also know that the Washington Post took gread exception to President Bush playing Golf . Does this derogatory article by the Post ring a bell . Michael Moore used Bush 's golfing which was far less that Obama 's in a Movie to mock Bush . The leftists hacks at the Post are to the point of being cartoon characters in their excuse making and covering up for a failed President . You people are a joke . The gulf is being destroyed and obama plays and plays . A real leader would be on the front lines continually working on this . obama has proven himself to be completely inept . And so has this writer . Find something else besides opinion , because yours is worthless . It would keep him from flying his private 747 all over the country to fund raisers , rigged town hall shows and photo ops . At least Andrews is close to the people 's house , I mean 0bamba 's house , sorry . With the first ladies garden providing food for him and the family and Andrews Air Force Base so close we can only hope that he stops his takeover of our representative Republic . `` We the people '' will start the very difficult task of taking back America on November 2 , 2010 , bet on it . Instead of his daily state run media\\/teleprompter speeches I can handle hearing `` FORE '' . Much less damage to the United States of America . The grounds keepers might get upset at Andrews but they have nothing to complain about , they are government workers , make a lot more than private sector workers so it 's works out better for everyone . WELL , except maybe for tax payers ... Posted by : kennethy692008 | June 15 , 2010 2:55 PM | Report abuse Stay on the golf course , Mr. President . You 're not doing us much good anyway . Fine , I 'll give you that Stromberg . But you just threw away your `` What an outrage , BP 's Hayward is yatching '' card . Sorry , ca n't have it both ways .

In the past week , the United States submitted its second request to the European Union for any specialized equipment to contain the oil now seeping onto the Gulf of Mexico 's marshes and beaches , and it accepted Canada 's offer of 9,842 feet of boom . The government is soliciting additional boom and skimmers from nearly two dozen countries and international organizations . In late May , the administration accepted Mexico 's offer of two skimmers and 13,779 feet of boom ; a Dutch offer of three sets of Koseq sweeping arms , which attach to the sides of ships and gather oil ; and eight skimming systems offered by Norway . `` As we understand what we need and identify domestic and foreign sources , we will act , '' said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley , who said the United States has received 21 aid offers from 17 countries and four international groups . `` We are maintaining contact with these countries , we are grateful for the offers , and we will take them up on these offers . '' But some lawmakers and outside experts are questioning whether the administration has been too slow to capitalize on these offers , lulled by BP 's estimates on the oil flow rate and on its capacity to cope with the aftermath of the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig . `` We 're clearly behind the curve because BP did not have the game plan to deal with this spill , '' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin -LRB- D-Md . -RRB- , who visited Louisiana on Friday . `` I do n't know if the federal government has the capacity it needs at this point . '' Anthony H. Cordesman , a national security and energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the administration has been hampered because the spill is `` a rare case '' where the traditional emergency response routine does not apply . `` Most emergency relief is based on proven technology and precedence , '' he said . `` We are now confronted by something that does n't match any of the models . '' The State Department sent letters to some U.S. allies two weeks after the accident , and the Coast Guard initially sought to assess what supplies might be available overseas , but the administration 's public posture on aid has been inconsistent . On May 5 , Crowley announced that 13 international offers had been received and that decisions on what to accept would be made `` in the next day or two .

Crowley said the Obama administration is well aware of what happened after Hurricane Katrina , when the U.S. government failed to capitalize on an unprecedented amount of foreign aid offers .

It was an ecological disaster . It was an economic nightmare . And there was absolutely nothing the the American president could do about it . In her column today , my Post colleague Anne Applebaum points out that The U.S. government does not possess a secret method for capping oil leaks . The U.S. government also did not possess a secret method for stopping hurricanes . But President Bush was not blamed for his failure to stop Hurricane Katrina ; he was blamed for the federal response that followed the storm . Today , Americans know Obama can not control the oil flow in the gulf , and they do not hold him responsible for it . But they do hold him responsible for the federal response -- and the failure of that response is what makes this disaster `` Obama s Katrina . '' As the New York Times points out today , the response to the spill has been `` chaotic '' -- `` bedeviled by a lack of preparation , organization , urgency , and clear lines of authority ... As a result the damage to the coastline and wildlife has been worse than it might have been if the response had been faster and orchestrated more effectively . '' Yesterday , after waiting eight weeks with no action from BP or Washington , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- finally took matters into his own hands and ordered the National Guard to build barrier walls nine miles off the coast to keep oil from reaching the Louisiana shore . Why did Jindal have to wait 56 days for help that never came ? Shouldn t the president have marshaled those resources himself -- and then , like Jindal , promised to send BP the bill ? And why not the same for beach clean up ? Or the broken claims process that has left tens of thousands without money to feed their families ? After Hurricane Katrina , scores of commentators on the left told us that the weak federal response was the result of Bush s anti-government ideology -- if you do not believe in government , they said , how can you marshal the government to respond in a crisis ? As the liberal American Prospect put it in October 2005 , '' When America needed its officials to step up to the challenge of a massive disaster , conservative government let us down . '' Well now liberal government has let us down . Now we have a president who believes in government more than perhaps any before in our history -- and on his watch the federal response to a massive disaster has been nothing short of a debacle . Apparently government is just as lumbering and inefficient under Democrats as it was under Republicans . The irony is that Obama has insisted on treating this crisis as if he were a caricature of a radical libertarian -- outsourcing every aspect to BP . Containing the oil slick so it does not reach the Gulf shore ? Brining in workers for beach clean up ? Speaking at the University of Michigan recently , Obama delivered a rousing defense of government -- but when it came to the crisis in the gulf he declared : `` Government is what ensures that ... oil spills are cleaned up by the companies that caused them . '' If Bush had similarly outsourced the federal response to such a crisis , he would have been pilloried in the press . Yet Obama -- a self-professed advocate of big government solutions to virtually every problem facing America -- thinks this particular problem belongs to the private sector . The hypocrisy is rank . Perhaps he needs to start thinking of the crisis in the gulf as a `` shovel-ready project '' -- or a teaching moment for Americans on how effective big government can be . Don t hold your breath waiting for that lesson to start anytime soon . You do not state the facts . There are thousands of people engaged by the federal government trying to stop the oil . The federal response started immediately . Why do you act as if nothing is being done ? Is it laziness or just your own political hypocrisy . Obama has caused no deaths with his response . Bush 's non-response lead to many deaths . Just exactly what are you comparing . Must the Gov of a state declare an emergency and then call in the National Guard ? Let 's get the rules out there and let people know who waited to react for real Obama or Jundal -LRB- R -RRB- Posted by : kidvid | June 15 , 2010 5:08 PM | Report abuse Bush denied there was even a problem during Katrina . People were stranded on their roofs while Bush was saying `` Heck of a job Brownie '' . His staff had to show him videos of news coverage before he even realized the federal response was at all inadequate . Katrina was n't mearly an act of God . New Orleans drowned because of weak leavies , making it a man made disaster . Considering it was Cheney 's energy task force loosening regulations for deep sea drilling that led to this leak , this is more like another Katrina for George Bush than Obama 's . The president 's response has n't been perfect . Eugene Robinson is right . This spill , however , is not even in the same species as Katrina . Obama is a thoughtful and intelligent leader . There 's your difference right there . Obama is a thoughtful and intelligent leader . There 's your difference right there . Oh , what 's the point ... . public results , and to take alternatives into account also . I kinda felt bad for you by the end of that interview ... but it 's clear from this piece that you have n't learned your lesson . You 're attacking Obama for exercising the governmental restraint that conservatives routinely advocate - and at the same time , you turn around and describe the result as a failure of `` liberal government . '' Exactly which one is it ? Or do you even care ? With Katrina it was ` should do ' first then the realization that ` can do ' was a desirable option , even for some people who matter . That 's what you get with a self-preoccupied radical authoritarian hack who has no qualifications nor any clue whatsoever on what it means -- what it requires -- to lead this republic . It was the fed gov 's business to get things done here -- disaster - and emergency-response are among the things the fed govt is actually SUPPOSED to be thoroughly involved with . Obama could have substantially mitigated this disaster by ensuring that the considerable resources and logistical capabilities of the United States were brought to bear ; and also by accepting aid from other nations . Instead , this hemming-and-hawing windbag jackass could n't wait to run to the teleprompter and start with the politicking and finger-pointing and useless rhetoric . To say the least , his sense of priorities is so bad , one can not help but think it 's indicative of another pathology -- to go along with his pathological narcissism . So , lib shills and enthralled Obama-zombies : we already know he sucks . You can admit it , too . What 's obvious is obvious . Go ahead , give up the unconditional Obama-support as the bad job that it is . You 'll feel better . Did you see that segment `` The Spilling Fields , '' where Stewart thoroughly disparages Obama for his `` response '' ? You libs ... not the sharpest tools in the shed . Where are the cries about the Obama socializing the oil industry ? You 'll have to ask Bobby `` State '' s Right '' Jindal why he waited for Uncle Sam 's blessing before acting in the state 's waters ? Bush would have gotten crucified by teh right for interfering in the private sector for doing half of what Obama has done federally in this industrial accident . But you miss the point of the article . The response has been chaotic because BP , the federal government and state\\/local government did not have a good plan in place prior to the spill . You make it sound that the blame lies with Obama and Thad Allen . As for Jindal 's plan for berms , it was n't approved quickly because it is so poorly conceived that it may actually make the problem worse . BP , the Army Corp of Engineers and environmentalists all thought it was a bad idea . BP finally agreed to pay for a part of the plan , but with the understanding that it took no responsibility for the consequences . Of course , the media is never willing to ask any hard questions when it does n't fit the narrative . Jindal 's a political opportunist , who is playing the media . But what is even more incredible is that we are still not ready for a catrastrophe of this magnitude , yet Bobby wants to continue with the risky drilling . What I said was that Thiessen 's particular attack made no sense . Please read more carefully . Hello , Dick , are you out there ? Can you tell me what resources were available and not brought to bear ? Can you tell me what foreign offers of assistance were turned down to the detriment of the region ? Please tell me you did n't get your information from Mark Levin . They recognized that most of the blame lay at the feet of governor of louisiana and Ray `` Chocolate '' Nagin and the corruption these people encouraged . Bush destroyed the agency with his crony appointments . You ca n't rebuild organizational capacity or replace the talented and dedicated people in a few months . Bush : the disaster that keeps on giving . Funny how people look like what they are . If young women , for example , paid attention to their first impression of a , say serial killer ... probably a warning one , perhaps such could be avoided . Thiessen looks like a thuggish moron . Some little twit who had an inside in a new republican administration , maybe a father who gave a bunch of bucks maybe he worked for the right person who was close to the candidate ... his jobs were all that kind of thing . Saw so many of them early on in the Reagan Administration . Thiessen does look like what he is . That 's not a compliment . Thuggish and rather stupid . Funny how people look like what they are . In this case , we get only a really stupid one note , same thing , blustering blab from a slob . Our own fault for reading it . The Washington Post has a stable of such . Not a decent writer among them . He thinks that by saying that the oil spill is Obama 's Katrina , that we will all believe it , and it will become the truth . Well it 's just like `` mission accomplished '' - NOT TRUE ! Thing is , the sand berm plan seriously flawed . It 's certainly a gamble and may prove to be a huge mistake . I would ask , who would be in favor of spending $ 350 million in tax dollars to build a wall of sand in the open Gulf that is going to be washed away almost before the wall is finished ? How long until the Post hires Michael Brown or Scooter Libby ? Bush destroyed the agency with his crony appointments . You ca n't rebuild organizational capacity or replace the talented and dedicated people in a few months . Bush : the disaster that keeps on giving . This administration is wrecking this country for the last 18 months and whenever something goes wrong it blames its recklessness and incompetence on Bush . Liberal accountability , contradiction in terms . Until then , this lame attempt by conservatives to play the comparison game is laughable . On the other hand , I am heartened by this sudden concern for the environment from conservatives . Apparently , all it took was a Democratic president . Kind of like their born again conversion as responsible fiscal stewards . Fact : The warnings were available for days before Katrina hit the coast . Fact : The BP oil disaster in the gulf was of manmade origin . Fact : There was no prior warning that the rig would explode . Try pinning this on Obama all you want , the facts speak for themselves . Neither Bush nor Obama were directly responsible for the two disasters mentioned . However , the lumps come with the responses before , during , and after the disasters . The far right will stop at nothing to find fault with Obama because they know that Bush was a disaster for 8 long years . As President of the United States , it was HIS job to protect our coast . Turning down help from other nations , blaming BP , dithering , etc. , resulted in an environmental disaster which he is responsible for . Obama is a better person than most Republicans that I know because he is willing to tackle disasters even when they hit Republican states . This disaster proves that there is indeed a role for government to have in the lives of citizens if nothing more than to regulate those entities that seem to think that they have the right to walk all over us . I 'll gladly pay my fair share of taxes to have decent roads , schools , armed forces , and so forth . I prefer to live in a country that is world class than one that is third world . These people who always want something for nothing irritate me . When disaster strikes , I do not hear anyone wishing that the government would do nothing . Even those who do not want to pay taxes want their handouts when disaster strikes . I wonder if they know where this money really comes from . The governor of Mississippi is such a two-faced individual . He wants to get to the bottom of the oil disaster but wants to keep drilling without waiting for the findings . Gov. Barbour is such a joke . Reasonable people know reasonable responses when they see and hear it . As President of the United States , it was HIS job to protect our coast . '' Did n't you ever hear the legend of King Canute ? Yeah , the king taught his foolish court a lesson by going to the seaside and commanding the waves and the tide to stop . If you have a good idea to contain and pick up the oil spill , go to www.deephorizons.com and submit it for review . Do n't waste your brilliance here . Please point out in any speech , written word or even off-the-cuff comment that indicates Obama believes government will `` solve '' all of America 's problems . Typical black and white , all or nothing conservative thinking -LRB- if ` thinking ' is what you want to call it -RRB- . government has a role to play in some problems - just read the comments from fellow conservatives , howling now about the inadequate government response . Apparently , THEY see value in government involvement . 2 -RRB- Why would n't this be a private sector problem ?? It was BP 's oil rig , paid for with BP money , staffed with BP employees . Any particular reason why it would not be their responsibility to solve it ? Conservatives are all for privatizing profits and socializing risk , and this article is a perfect example of it . Thinker16 is not thinking clearly . The last time that I checked , the one who causes the harm should be responsbile for taking appropriate actions to prevent further harm as well as to take care of the harm done . As a taxpayer , I resent my hard earned dollars being used to take care of someone elses negligence . It seems that I heard this sentiment a lot regarding the Wall Street bailout in 2008 . Bailing out BP is such another nice deal for the arrogance of another corporation . Also , the writer wants to blame Obama for not being able to deliver on something that is not his to deliver on . Also , he has his facts wrong . I think that he has been listening to too much Fox noise and not good media sources . Uh , what caused the bloated bodies was not the hurricane itself but the levies that broke , federal levies , ya know , as in the federal government is responsible for those levies , as in the federal government should act when its levies break . I 'm no fan of Nagin , but the levies were a federal responsibility , and we all know how republicans feel about responsibilities , ya know , like they are for someone else . Obama is taking responsibility for forcing BP to act not only on stopping the spill but in protecting the environment -LRB- ya know , that thing the lefty loony environmentalists keep harping about -RRB- and bringing the military to bear to monitor BP , monitor the protections , monitor the cleanup and report problems . There is a USCG admiral in charge . Bush sent the former Commissioner for the International Arabian Horse Association to oversee the federal response to the broken levies . If not then you should just stay out of this conversation . One was a natural disaster and the other , a Cat 5 hurricane . I would only add that many of those people who were able to escape the water or who were rescued from their own rooftops were then warehoused like chickens in a filthy stadium where families literally had to scrounge around to find a place to sleep that was not fouled with their own waste . `` Obama 's Katrina '' -- I am so tired of this utter garbage . Bush seemed indifferent and days after Katrina stated that `` no one could have foreseen the breach of the levees . '' This video showed him caught in a lie and fully warned . And I suppose in your mind the deaths of 1800 Americans does compare to no deaths after the initial 11 in the oil explosion ? Let 's see , the oil spill is Obama 's Katrina . The underwear bomber was Obama 's Katrina . H1N1 was Obama 's Katrina . Haiti was Obama 's Katrina . The GM Bankruptcy was Obama 's Katrina . Hood shootings were Obama 's Katrina . Even the Kentucky ice storms were Obama 's Katrina . Has n't the right wing ever heard the story of the `` Boy Who Cried Wolf '' ? What 's almost as bad is that the so-called liberal media seems complicit in this spin . For 57 months I 've heard Republicans yell that the Katrina response was not a Fed . issue , but a local one . Now that a PRIVATE corporation is at fault it 's suddenly a Federal responsibility . Talk about your hypocrisy !

It is an ecological disaster . It is a economic nightmare . And there is absolutely nothing that the American president can do about it . Here is the hard truth : The U.S. government does not possess a secret method for capping oil leaks . Even the combined wisdom of the Obama inner circle -- all of those Harvard economists , silver-tongued spin doctors and hardened politicos -- can not prevent tens of thousands of tons of oil from pouring out of hole a mile beneath the ocean surface . Other than proximity to the Louisiana coast , this catastrophe has nothing in common with Hurricane Katrina : That was an unstoppable natural disaster that turned into a human tragedy because of an inadequate government response . This is just an unstoppable disaster , period . It will be a human tragedy precisely because no government response is possible . Which leads me to a mystery : Given that he can not stop the oil from flowing , why has President Obama decided to act as if he can ? And given that he is totally reliant on BP to save the fish and the birds of the Gulf of Mexico , why has he started pretending otherwise -- why is he , in his own words , looking for someone 's `` ass to kick '' ? I suspect that there are many reasons for this recent change of rhetorical tone and that some of them are ideological . This is , of course , a president who believes that government can and should be able to solve all problems . Obama has never sounded particularly enthusiastic about the private sector either , and some of his congressional colleagues -- the ones talking of retroactively raising the cap on BP 's liability , for example , or forcing BP to pay for the lost wages of other oil companies ' workers -- are downright hostile . A large part of the explanation , however , is cultural : Obama has been forced to take a commanding role in a crisis he can not control because we expect him to -- both `` we '' the media and `` we '' the bipartisan public . Whatever their politics , most Americans in recent years have come to expect a strong response -- an invasion , massive legislation -- from their politicians in times of crisis , and this one is no exception . We want the president to lead -- somewhere , anywhere . A few days ago , the New York Times declared that `` he and his administration need to do a lot more to show they are on top of this mess '' and should have started `` putting the heat '' on BP much earlier -- as if that would have made the remotest bit of difference . But Mitt Romney , who last I checked is right of center , sounded almost exactly the same note : Obama , he said , should be `` leading this entire effort to bring together the experts , the various oil company executives , the engineers from various oil companies as well as from the various academic think tanks . '' This comment reminds me of the time the European Union solemnly decided to form a committee to fight unemployment , as if that were an actual solution . I also love the idea that all of those offshore oil engineers twiddling their thumbs at think tanks -- the Heritage Foundation ? -- are only waiting for the president 's phone call to spring into action . In truth , the organization most likely to have the phone numbers of the `` experts '' is BP . The organization that will get them to Louisiana fastest is BP . I am writing this not because I like , admire or even have an opinion about the company formerly known as British Petroleum but because BP 's shareholders have already lost billions of dollars and BP 's executives are motivated to find solutions faster than anyone in the White House ever could . Bashing BP or seeking to punish BP is pointless . This is not only because we will soon learn that many companies -- American , Japanese , even Halliburton -- were responsible for that rig but also because whatever the solution , BP has to be part of it . Paradoxically , `` talking tough '' about this oil crisis also makes both Obama and America look weak internationally -- just as `` talking tough '' about Iran made the Bush administration look weak . Harsh rhetoric is fine if it reflects a real will to do something , a real plan of action and the existence of a Plan B , for when the first one fails . But when angry words -- anti-BP , anti-British , anti-oil company -- reflect the absence of any alternative policy whatsoever , they sound pathetic . It 's right for Obama to be concerned about the consequences of this disaster , but wrong -- and dangerous -- for him to pretend he is capable of controlling it . We should stop calling on him to do so .

The letter , sent in advance of congressional hearings with senior oil executives this week , paints a damning picture of five decisions the lawmakers said the oil firm took `` to speed finishing the well , '' which was running `` significantly behind schedule . '' Marshaling e-mails , interviews and documents , the lawmakers said : `` In effect , it appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time , and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk . '' In one instance , four days before the April 20 explosion , Brett Cocales , one of BP 's operations drilling engineers , sent an e-mail to a colleague noting that engineers had not taken all the usual steps to center the steel pipe in the drill hole , a standard procedure designed to ensure that the pipe would be properly cemented in place . '' -LRB- W -RRB- ho cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine and we 'll get a good cement job , '' he wrote . Cocales could not be reached to comment Monday , and Andrew Gowers , a company spokesman , said only that `` it would be inappropriate for us to comment ahead of the hearing . '' The letter was part of another bad day for BP . The company 's stock dropped 9 percent , to $ 30.67 a share . Investors fretted about a White House meeting Wednesday between top BP directors and President Obama , who will also make the oil spill the centerpiece of his first Oval Office address at 8 p.m. Tuesday . Speaking inside a large shelter at a Coast Guard clean-up staging area in Theodore , Ala. , on Monday , Obama vowed that `` we 're going to continue to hold BP and any other responsible parties accountable for the disaster that they created . '' That cost to BP will dwarf whatever amounts its rig workers were worried about . White House officials were working to strike a deal with the oil giant on a multibillion-dollar escrow account to compensate victims , administration advisers said . Led by White House counsel Robert F. Bauer , administration negotiators were hoping to finish an agreement before the meeting Wednesday . Obama called talks `` constructive . '' One potential area of disagreement loomed : whether the escrow account would be limited or whether it could be replenished , as the administration is demanding . BP is also seeking assurance that money be used only for reasonable or `` legitimate '' claims through an impartial administrator . Investment analysts expect that BP might suspend or reduce its dividend to fund an escrow account that some lawmakers have demanded be as large as $ 20 billion . `` Suspending the dividend would significantly reduce the political heat on BP and enhance its financial flexibility , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer . `` BP can raise $ 20 billion in escrow account within days . '' Meanwhile , rival oil companies , worried about new regulations or limits on deepwater drilling off U.S. coasts , began openly criticizing BP . `` What we do know is that when you properly design wells for the range of risk anticipated ; follow established procedures ; build in layers of redundancy ; properly inspect and maintain equipment ; train personnel ; conduct tests and drills ; and focus on safe operations and risk management , tragic incidents like the one in the Gulf of Mexico today should not occur , '' Kenneth P. Cohen , Exxon Mobil 's vice president of public and government affairs , said in a blog . But Exxon Mobil 's criticism paled next to the 14-page letter that Rep. Henry A. Waxman -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , and Rep. Bart Stupak -LRB- D-Mich . -RRB- , chairman of the panel 's subcommittee on oversight and investigations , sent to BP chief executive Tony Hayward , who will testify before the committee Thursday . After reviewing documents and interviews the committee obtained , the two lawmakers said that `` BP appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure . '' The money that BP allegedly saved seems trivial in light of the blowout that killed 11 Deepwater Horizon rig workers and led to the oil spill that has polluted large swaths of the gulf . But given the daily costs of $ 1 million to $ 2 million to run a drilling rig , they appear to have been a big factor in the decision-making .

Politics , politicians , big business and the economy Could the BP oil spill increase GDP ? Annie Lowrey notes a J.P. Morgan Chase analysis suggesting the BP spill will actually raise the country 's GDP , at least in the short term . `` Cleaning up the spill will likely be enough to slightly offset the negative impact of all this on GDP , J.P. Morgan said , '' summarizes Luca Di Leo . `` The bank cites estimates of 4,000 unemployed people hired for the cleanup efforts , which some reports have said could be worth between $ 3 and $ 6 billion . '' This is a nice object lesson in the inadequacy of GDP as a measurement of societal well-being . I could blow up the biggest building in every city in the country and the resulting reconstruction effort could mean a big temporary increase in GDP . But blowing up buildings is not a sustainable way to grow your economy . GDP , of course , has its uses , and as Bruce Bartlett points out , it provides a rich source of historical data and we would n't want to abandon it completely . But there 's no reason we could n't also use more comprehensive measures , and this Urban Institute report -LRB- pdf -RRB- gives a nice overview of what they would look like . Photo credit : Spencer Platt\\/Getty Images By Ezra Klein | June 15 , 2010 ; 11:35 AM ET Of course the oil spill will increase the GDP . Car crashes do , too . Please crash your car today . The brothers in the body shop need to eat just like everyone else . But then his other policies , and the negative effects of the war -LRB- increased energy prices , debt , distractions from domestic issues -RRB- overshadowed all else and , Voila ! , the great recession . I have long said not all ten trillion dollars in GDP are the same , or create the same total societal utils , or future growth . One of the biggest flaws of the GDP measure is that it includes crime and security costs as production , rather than a cost of production . The Economist 's Voice -LRB- edited by Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz -RRB- had an excellent article on this and the great societal costs of crime and security ; quoting : The extent of guard labor depends on exactly what you count , of course . But by our preferred estimates -LRB- which we explain shortly -RRB- , roughly one in four in the United States economy is now engaged in guard labor providing security for people and property and imposing work discipline . Since 1890 the guard labor fraction of the United States labor force has increased four-fold . And in Sweden today the guard labor fraction is less than half that of the United States . Our measures of guard labor in the United States are necessarily incomplete and our definitions difficult to implement -LRB- Are lawyers guard labor ? Even some economists ? -RRB- ... We have also ignored labor involved in the production of weapons for self protection , of locks and security cameras , and surveillance devices such as the trackers attached to long haul trucks to monitor their drivers speed and routes . We do not think we have overestimated the number of supervisors ; we have certainly missed some types of work that could be termed guard labor . Ezra , I hope you eventually read this short article . It really shows one of the great costs of a generation of Republican dominance which has brought us to a level of income inequality beyond even that of the gilded age . Our economy is still in the toilet , the `` Markets '' have no clue about what to do outside of more executive bonuses , and our Gulf Coast is going to be devestated - again . If throwning money and resources lessens the decades of suffering they now have to endure , then I 'll sign off ... at least it 's being spent on the relative betterment of middle\\/lower class Americans here in the US . Ezra , your comparison is useless since it anticipates the destruction as a genesis for spending money ... like with Lomillialor 's Iraq comparison . No one , ever , will say we should create an environmental disaster to ruin people and the environment to initiate a destructive\\/creative cycle . On the other hand , the least we can do is try and make the best of this nightmare . What 's important is HOW money gets spent , and it 's good to see that Ezra agrees at least in principle . forever , the primest commercial and residential real estate made totally devoid of any value . Short term growth of a percentage point or two will not offset the loss of tens of percentage points in total US assests . If the article were n't so absurd it would be obscene .

The dramatic increase in the estimated flow rate raises the question of whether BP and the government were fully prepared to cope with the hydrocarbons spewing up through the gulf floor . Currently BP has the capacity to capture only 18,000 barrels of day coming from the well . A second method of tapping the well , one that will add up to 10,000 barrels of capacity , will take oil and gas through the `` choke '' line on the blowout preventer that was used in the `` top kill '' operation last month . Instead of drilling mud going down the line , oil and gas will be brought up the line to a ship at the surface , where BP plans to burn the oil and gas in two separate flares . But as it has become apparent that the well is spewing far more oil than originally estimated , the Obama administration has pressed BP to add additional capacity to capture it . BP responded this weekend with a new plan that will put enough vessels on site by the end of June to handle 53,000 barrels a day , and the company said it will ramp that up to 80,000 barrels by the middle of July . `` As we continue to collect additional data and refine these estimates , it is important to realize that the numbers can change . In particular , the upper number is less certain -- which is exactly why we have been planning for the worst case scenario from the beginning and why we are continuing to focus on responding to the upper end of the estimate , plus additional contingencies , '' Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said in a written statement . Eric Smith , of the Tulane Energy Institute , said BP should have had more ships standing by to handle the flow from the well . `` I think everyone was shocked when they peaked out in terms of ... capacity , '' Smith said . `` The total flow out of this thing is pretty impressive . This is a wicked formation , '' said physical oceanographer Ian MacDonald of Florida State University . `` The gas is what they ca n't control , what they could n't control , what drove the explosion and killed all the people . That 's the power behind this dragon . '' The rising estimate has become a central feature of the oil spill narrative . Originally the government pegged the spill at 1,000 barrels a day , then soon raised that to 5,000 barrels , then 12,000 to 19,000 barrels , and then , just last week to 20,000 to 40,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 to 1.68 million gallons -RRB- . But that last estimate , largely based on research by government-appointed scientists known as the Flow Rate Technical Group , came with a caveat : They were looking at older data , including video taken of the damaged riser pipe when it still had multiple leaks . After the pipe was cut on June 3 , and a containment cap placed on it , the flow became easier to estimate . In the past 24 hours scientists have taken direct measurements of pressures inside the so-called top hat that is collecting oil and gas . An administration official said via e-mail on Tuesday that the larger figure was the result of better data on the flow , not necessarily a reflection of the flow increasing when the riser pipe was cut . James Riley , a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Washington , and a member of the flow rate group , said his team , which looked at high resolution video of the geyser after the riser cut , saw evidence of an increase in flow , `` but not a dramatic increase . '' He stressed , however , that it 's not an exact science .

Lawmakers attack plans oil companies had in place to deal with a spill Five oil giants . Five plans for coping with an oil spill , all written by the same tiny Texas subcontractor . The government-mandated plans all came under attack at a congressional hearing Tuesday : Three of them listed the phone number for the same University of Miami marine science expert , Peter Lutz , who died in 2005 . Four talked about the need to protect walruses , which , as Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- dryly noted , `` have not called the Gulf of Mexico home for 3 million years . '' The plans also mentioned protecting sea lions and seals , which are n't found in the gulf , either . The five oil companies submitted these plans -- each more than 500 pages long and each relying on the same reassuring language -- as part of their applications for permits to drill deepwater wells in the gulf . The firms assured the government that they could handle oil spills much larger than the one now threatening the region 's environment and economy . And each time , the Minerals Management Service approved the plan and gave the go-ahead for drilling . Yet House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry A. Waxman -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- said that the `` cookie-cutter '' plans show that `` none of the five oil companies has an adequate response plan '' for a spill like the one that began April 20 with a blowout on a BP well . `` It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the bunch , '' Rep. Bart Stupak -LRB- D-Mich . -RRB- said at a hearing of the House Energy and Environment subcommittee . `` But unfortunately they appear to have plenty of company . Exxon and the other oil companies are just as unprepared to respond to a major oil spill in the gulf as BP . '' The firms ' top executives offered a mixture of regret and defense . Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson said provisions for walrus protection in gulf plans are `` an embarrassment . '' Grilled by Stupak about how the companies could say they could handle spills many times the size of the current one , Tillerson also conceded , `` We are not well-equipped to handle them . '' But he asserted that whenever large spills happen , `` there will be impacts , as we are seeing . '' And he added , `` We 've never represented anything different than that . '' He said the company 's plans contain a worst-case scenario `` that the MMS and the Coast Guard require us to calculate using their methodologies , and that 's why it 's in there . '' Tillerson said that prevention was the best strategy , and he and the executives from Conoco Phillips , Chevron and Shell Oil criticized BP 's handling of the well blowout , which killed 11 workers and sunk the Deepwater Horizon rig . `` We would not have drilled the well the way they did , '' the Exxon chief said . Lawmakers stressed the need to have plans in place in case all else failed . And whereas the companies have hired top-tier contractors to carry out their search for oil and gas , but relied on smaller less well-known companies to handle spill planning . The spill response plans for all five companies were written by the same firm , the Response Group . Although it has operations in at least seven cities nationwide , the Houston-based firm 's Web site says the company has about 35 employees . -LRB- One current assignment : calling 50,000 people who have visited BP offices and getting their e-mail addresses and emergency contact information . -RRB- Waxman also noted that the five companies rely on Marine Spill Response to provide equipment . `` When you look at the details , it becomes evident these plans are just paper exercises , '' he said . The response plans , which the committee posted on its Web site , show that the companies also used common assumptions for different exploration wells . BP used the same model for all its wells in the gulf , using a location about 33 miles away from the where the accident occurred .

Writing for Newsweek , Ravi Somaiya observes that in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the former vice president has remained notably silent . What s notable , Somaiya points out , is that , When the Obama administration , or the media , or just about anybody contradicts Dick Cheney 's views on national security , he is far from shy about responding . So as a hawk for big oil , one might expect Cheney to defend his pro-petro views in the face of withering -LRB- and near-universal -RRB- opprobrium from both public and president . For eight years , of course , Cheney played dual roles as vice president of the United States and as unofficial at-large congressman for the petroleum industry . The former vice president s murky ties to Halliburton , the Houston oil services company he once ran , are well documented , and he continues to face ridicule for having allowed executives from oil companies to dictate American energy policy during the George W. Bush presidency . At Mother Jones , Kate Sheppard looks extensively into the potential cause-and-effect relationship between Cheney s infamous 2001 energy task force and the gulf catastrophe . The task force 's final report , Sheppard writes , presented a rosy picture of the offshore drilling industry . Newer oil and gas drilling methods , it said , practically eliminate spills from offshore platforms and enhance worker safety , lower risk of blowouts , and provide better protection of groundwater resources . Symbolic of Cheney s connection -- past , present , and future -- to Big Oil is BP s hiring of Anne Womack-Kolton as its chief of U.S. media relations . Womack-Kolton served as Cheney s press secretary during the 2004 campaign and later worked for President Bush s Department of Energy . While this small bit of employment news is far too circumstantial to gin up serious outrage , it nonetheless puts a nice bow around the questionable coziness between government and industry that Bush and Cheney encouraged during their time in the White House . Perhaps the blatancy of this connection is contributing to the veep s reticence . Whatever the reason , Cheney seems content to let his daughter , Liz Cheney , defend Big Oil and the family legacy , as she did -- ineffectively -- on ABC 's `` This Week '' earlier this month . If you have a better defense to offer , Mr. Cheney , now might be the time . By Katrina vanden Heuvel | June 16 , 2010 ; 5:08 PM ET Who the hell cares ? He 's not VP anymore . All the attempts to blame Bush and Cheney for this -LRB- and everything else -RRB- does n't change that . This left wing whack job does n't have any kind of grasp on reality . Is she talking solutions ? Is she talking about what needs to be done ? No , she is talking about some guy in his 80s who used to be the Vice President . earth to nit-wit come in . It 's important to continually remind people about that dark period and the consequences of putting ideological extremists like Cheney and Bush in power . It 's been proven over and over again that Americans have extremely short memories , so it 's critical that commentators like you `` connect the dots '' between the deregulatory zeal and cozy government-big oil , big finance policies of the Bush years , and the disasters we 're facing now . It 's not surprising that wingnuts and right wing apologists like bbface21 are eager to change the subject , but please do bring this back to the disaster that was the Cheney\\/Bush years every chance you get ! Our level of dependence on oil is so great ... if anything serious had happened to our suppliers in other parts of the world bringing our country into a shortage situation , any administration would have been crucified by the left for not being proactive and cooperative with our own oil industry . All this barf about `` ties to big oil '' is as misinformed as most of the junk the democrat party coughs up . Do they think democrat elites have no ties to Big Oil ? Can someone remind me how much money BP gave to Obama 's campaign ? Not much of THAT talk going around , is there ? Those secret meetings where BP , Exxon , the coal and nuclear industries were invited to write -LRB- i 'd say gut -RRB- the environmental and safety regulatory laws for the energy industry . Where 's Cheney now ? In the bunker , no doubt . You did n't get the memo ? Obama\\/Biden have been in the White House for over a year and a half . Bush\\/Cheney is no more to blame for this horrible disaster than Obama\\/Biden . From Katrina 's posting all I see is innuendo -LRB- some broad who worked for Cheney 's campaign works for BP -RRB- and a hatred that borders on the pathological . But no , it 's Bush 's fault . Corporate negligence - Bush 's fault . Inept federal response - Bush 's fault -LRB- even though he left office 18 months ago -RRB- . Dog pooped on the carpet-Bush 's fault too . I 'm no fan of the guy , but blaming him for everything that goes wrong after leaving office a long time ago is getting ridiculous . As written by real people and not Rove . He is also probably trying to pull a few strings to get the Halliburton subsidiary KBR a `` No Bid '' job on the clean-up . When there is big money up to something Cheney will be there eventually . He can make talks on policy issues , its his perogative ... after all Mr. Carter won a Nobel for damning America right ? But he has no policy input . Now Mr. Cheney may be influential as a pundit . And probably a lot more influential than for instance ... oh . . say ... let me think . . say for instance ... . YOU , who have never done SQUAT in your life to safeguard your country except to vomit on it . Ms Vanden Quibble ... how about writing about people who do control policy . you say that 's no fun ? You ca n't bring yourself to hold a blue-stater responsible for his\\/her actions ? I see ... I see , Posted by : wjc1va | June 16 , 2010 11:05 PM | Report abuse Vanden Heuvel seems on a quest to top each previous op-ed piece with something more absurd and nonsensical . For eight years , Cheney was vice-president and unofficial congressman for the oil industry ? What a complete fabrication . His `` murky ties '' to Halliburton ? More inane tripe - there was nothing murky about his position at that company , from which he cut all financial ties when taking office . With so little of substance to say , on virtually any topic , leftists such as Katrina would be better served doing something more productive with their lives . Dick Cheney was made fabulously rich for his `` services '' to Halliburton . Mind you this man was not star student in college . He did not possess a degree in engineering , geology or physics . He parlayed connections , political connections . There should be a full scale reexmination of his so called `` energy summit '' . The public should become aware of what deals were cut . While we are on the subject of oil , let 's ask George W. Bush what he thinks about the oil `` leak '' . If gushing millions of gallons of oil is a `` leak '' I shudder to think of what a blow out would be . You add deregualtion and Bush\\/Cheney and you receive the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico . That led to a serious oil spill that is threatening the Gulf Coast . Those are purely physical problems and a national crisis . Vanden Heuvel and other have done their best to make this a political issue , because that 's all they know how to do any more . The Obama Administration is failing because they have done the same . Rather than deal with this as a national emergency , they are treating it as a political issue and an opportunity to advance a political agenda . Shame on all of them . The saddest thing of all is that , regardless of one 's political differences with Dick Cheney , there is probably no one in America better qualified or more prepared to coordinate the federal response to this crisis . As a former member of Congress , former White House Chief of Staff , former Secretary of Defense , former Vice President , and former CEO of Halliburton , he knows where the levers are and who to mobilize . Most of the left that hates him seems unaware that Halliburton is an oil field service company and works with everyone across the world involved in petroleum engineering . Cheney could probably have drafted an action plan in a few hours in longhand on a legal pad that was superior to two months of so-called `` work '' by the Obama Administration . He could likely have done it from an undisclosed location barely referring to his rolodex . He knows how the military , and departments and agencies of government interact and what would have to be done to facilitate their coordination , not just with one another , but with state authorities and potential industry and international partners . The well might not yet be capped , but the shores would be safe . It is a sad day for this country when nothing can be accomplished because of the political venom of the left . The important thing now is to get this done . We can worry about everything else later . It seems that BP must take full responsibility for all wrongs notwithstanding that an enquiry has not taken place . One should consider the contributions to the failures by BPs never mentioned partners and the approvals given by State and Federal Governments . There will be litigation over Obama 's declaration of guilt . It seems that there is no need for courts in the case of BP and Guantanamo Detainees as far as the US is concerned . Americans are rightly outraged by the oil spill and the damage that is being caused but would n't an equivalent amount of damage be caused by ordinary people if they put that oil into their car engines ? How many of them care about Pacific and Indian Ocean island nations that are suffering from rising seas because of the oil that is burnt by car engines around the world ? I say stop screaming , remain calm and work solutions out calmly . If he opens his mouth , he must fear that the American people will recall , with no little amount of disgust , that it was Mr. Cheney who brought all those CEOs of the U.S. mega-oil companies once upon a time to the White House and there , shamefacedly , asked them to write U.S. Energy Policy . Of course , it was to be expected that the George W. Bush Energy Policy would favor those big oil companies , including probably exempting those oil companies with oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico from making sure that their rigs would be secure from blowups . And under Bush\\/Cheney leadership , the United States relaxed oversight . There was always a plan to deal with such a horrific spill . It was , however , never funded or advanced beyond the planning stage . And it allowed one of the worst corporate offenders to put life and our resources at risk so they could maximize profit . For Cheney and others of his ilk , profit goes before human life or our environment . Telling lies in pursuit of profit is considered no more wrong than bribery , spying or packing the Supreme Court . My thanks to Ms. Vanden Heuvel for reminding us that a brash , mean-spirited liar helped lead us into this mess we 'll be dealing with the rest of our lives . His silence at the moment speaks volumes . The daily tweets from Sarah `` Drill Baby '' are also an example of someone who has been more than ready to share her views on a miriad of subjects . That she has now resorted to gabbing about her `` push-ups '' is no surprise . She has really only one subject of conversation , Sarah . Her followers love her meglomania it would seem . Now that we 're talking about the profound silence of Dick Halliburton , what about Condoleeza Chevron ? Donald Enron not to mention all the other corporate blockers that filled the Bush administration or Papa Bush and his Carlyle Hedge fund . In the Washington Times people are moaning about the history of squandering energy since the seventies . It 's a sign of the poverty of various administrations since that time that fuel efficiency is still regarded as a luxury . What 's amusing is that energy efficiency is a `` conservative '' idea but the republican party has long turned its back on conservativism and moved towards a reactionary destructive agenda . The wingnut righties who sat complacently by and uttered not a word while Cheney set us up for this catastrophe , want us to forget about that period . I live on the coast and I resent people who have no clue , trying to make us forget what actually helped cause this disaster . You may want us to forget Bush\\/Cheney ... we wo n't . And , based on his exemplary record of avoiding service in Vietnam , Mr. Five Deferments is a gutless coward . This is just further proof of that . The media need to hold this criminal accountable for his past remarks and actions on energy policy in light of this unprecedented disaster -LRB- note : same phrase could be applied to the entire 8-year reign of his co-presidency -RRB- . Well , I would like to see the minutes of meetings Obama and his Obamanistas held with ACORN when they were working on this disastrous administration 's agenda . And let 's throw in the minutes of the 20 odd meetings Andy Stern of the SEIU had at the White House . Since Obama was elected , only the milkman has been to the White House more than Stern . The fact that we are oil dependent makes oil production a matter of the first importance . The envoirmental laws promulgated by decades of good works by concerned citizens have been used to literally push oil production off of land and near shore where it is safe to produce . Lets put aside the sophistry claiming alternative energy sources like wind , thermal , and ethanal can meet more than a tiny fraction of our consumption . It was not President Obama 's fault but it is on his turn at watch . If there was some loosening of the inspection agencies charged with preventing blowouts they can only be held responsible to the extent that they did thier job poorly because there are and always will be blowouts when drilling for presurized deposits of oil . Was it something done by former Vice President Cheney . No it was not . When this first happened , I thought that Cheney -LRB- and company -RRB- might have `` orchestrated '' this spill to upend and end the Obama presidency . Perhaps in some subversive , clandestine way , he and\\/or Halliburton set it up by selling bad products to BP . It 's not beyond the imagination . The fact that Cheney has remained silent on a subject that is `` his baby '' is very suspicious and speaks volumes . I do want the notes , policy discussions and\\/or changes , and all documentation that came of his energy summit that is `` to sensitive '' for the American public to see . Of course , he is not talking . He does not want to be rightly linked to this . Sorry Mr. President , you need a little more help than this hack !!! Posted by : billstraley1-drgolf | June 17 , 2010 9:51 AM | Report abuse You do n't honestly expect anyone from the bush administration to accept responsibility , do you ? Bush has never accepted responsibility - his disasterous presidential administration was too large of a mess for even daddy and all his cronies to bail him out of . He walked away , scott free again , and the nation paid the price . Well folks , welcome to the results of small government and deregulation - the basis of the teabagger and republican ideology . Without adults in the room , the results are disasterous . Borrow and spend - fiscal conservatism republican style . Now their effects of their `` fiscal conservatism '' will once again be paid for by the middle and lower classes , while they laugh all the way to the bank . The wall street and banking fiascos , the deregulation of the oil and mining industries all led to disaster - but yet , there 's still clammoring for less government . Industries can regulate themselves , right ? Cheney and bush made their benefactors very wealthy , and the nation suffered . There 's a special place reserved for people the likes of bush and cheney . Cheney deserves much more scorn than he receives . He was the puppetmaster in this oil disaster , yet he 's invisible . Well , I would like to see the minutes of meetings Obama and his Obamanistas held with ACORN when they were working on this disastrous administration 's agenda . And let 's throw in the minutes of the 20 odd meetings Andy Stern of the SEIU had at the White House . Since Obama was elected , only the milkman has been to the White House more than Stern . bugger - you braindead moron . If you would have escaped your delusional echo chamber even momentarilly , you would be aware that just recently ACORN was found to be completely clear of any wrongdoing . This is the intellect of the folks on the right . This , to a company that has received 760 citations for `` egregious '' safety violations since 2007 . The rest of the oil industry received one . Since the disaster , Obama placed a moratorium on 33 deepwater exploratory wells , but allowed the continuing production of 591 deep water wells . What 's even worse , BP has a deep water well , Atlantis , operating in the Gulf in waters DEEPER that the Horizon rig . According to congressional documents , this platform lacks required engineering certification for as much as 90 % of its subsea components ! On May 19th , 2010 , twenty-six congressmen sent Salazar a letter calling for the immediate shut done of the BP Atlantis rig . All the above info has been reported by Rolling Stone Magazine . You would think a newspaper like the Washington Post would be the one leading the way in this investigation . You can only blame your predecessor for so long before you have to take responsibility . So it seems that the Obama administration is continuing the terrible policies of the Bush-Cheney administration , in deepwater oil drilling -LRB- remember `` Drill , Baby , Drill '' ? -RRB- and also carrying on two wars in Iraq & Afghanistan . Is it too much to ask President Obama and his media sycophants to pull up their collective `` big boy & girl pants '' and take a modicum of personal responsibility for fixing the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico ? It is not 2008 and this ai n't Iowa . Grow up already kids . You are in charge . As frightening as it is for some of us to say , you are now `` The Man . '' Clearly , he donned a wet suit , dived a mile down , and personally attached a timed explosive change to the BP well . Ernst Starvo Blofeld where are you now that we need you ? I do n't think it 's any coincidence that we 've got these 24\\/7 paid bloggers constantly bashing President Obama who has already kept us MORE safe than the Bush Administration was able to do . Plus it seems we have the entire Republican party in complete denial about all the harm the Republicans did last time they were in office . It 's well known fact that the Bushes want to hold on to the White House for generations to come to push their agenda which is completely selfish and centered around their own personal interests . We 've already seen what they will do , if given the opportunity , and it has nothing at all to do with the health and well being of the United States of America . Dick Cheney disciples have been taught to never accept blame , just blame others . Their contortions are amusing . Small government conservatives now claim the government -LRB- well Obama specifically -RRB- should have been maintaining an army of oil spill prevention and recovery infratsurtcure and people sitting idle in case such a spill would happen - even with their assurances it never would . Laissez Faire conservatives now claim that Obama should have stepped in and removed BP and conducted the spill containment and clean up himself , which of course if he would have done this it would be just another claim to a socialist take-over . Now Tea Party conservatives are claiming Obama has `` shaken down '' BP to put a $ 20 billion slush fund in place when it `` has not even been proven what fault really is '' , instead of assuring that BP -LRB- who has years of history of never fulfilling its commitments -RRB- fulfils its commitments to the people of the gulf . The have it both ways conservatives are a walking prtzel of distorted logic , with only one aim which is to trash Obama . They make criticisms and statements that directly contradict their principles time and time again . I think that is because they have no principles , only hatred of Obama . Dick `` deficits do n't matter '' Cheney was their neocon leader , and set the stage for everything that is playing out now . They can not have their ideological leader called out for his years of failed policies or it makes them look like the fialures that they are . It was conservative ploicies -LRB- combined with failed liberal policies -RRB- that have dug us into a huge deficit situation , crashed our banking system and economy , stripped our individua rights and made a disaster of our gulf . And now , like these conservatives have any credibility , have the nerve to defend oil company profits and the right to continue deep water drilling when it has been demonstrated that NONE of the oil companies have the ability to respond any better then BP has . This is a private sector disaster , compounded by private sector influence in government to turn a blind regulatory eye towards private sector safety responsibilities . It is a private sector mess that the private sector is responsibe to clean up . Just one more example of how `` Danger Dick '' Cheney 's laissez faire ideology has failed , and how conservatism has failed , the same way the lack of oversight over unregulated mortgage backed securities , credit default swaps and derivatives speculation have failed this country . Another worthless , info-less column . Why would anyone care what Cheney 's thoughts on the rig are ? Why does the Post carry this shell of a columnist ? Is she talking about what needs to be done ? No , she is talking about some guy in his 80s who used to be the Vice President . Earth to nit-wit come in . I haven t heard Republicans offer up any solutions at all either , and you re certainly not offering any . Sounds as though Republicans and these other miscellaneous Tea Baggers and naysayers liked it a whole lot better when our threat level was being raised up and down depending on Republican popularity . Heck , even MSNBC liberal talking heads Olbermann and Matthews blasted BO 's oval office speech so I guess Rahm and Axelrod are reaching out to their friends in the media and saying ... `` why do n't you ask where cheney is in all this '' Posted by : bushido11 | June 17 , 2010 11:54 AM | Report abuse Where 's Dick Cheney on the BP oil spill ? Jesus , Mary , Joseph , he 's SILENT . This is something some of us have been awaiting since 2000 . PLEASE do n't try to lure him from his cave . A silent Dick is the best Dick . Some folks here have suggested he would be the most qualified person to handle this disaster . For his own interests , certainly , for America 's , certainly not . May he live out his days in a bunker or cave far from the rest of humanity . What VP Cheney does n't comment on and visa what he does comment on is irrelevant . To sandwich his silence on an issue around the actual argument -LRB- that the former VP 's cozy relationship with the oil companie sis in part to blame for the gulf -RRB- is totally irrelevant to the actual argument . It neither contributes nor detracts from the real argument but is usually employed when the real argument can not stand on it 's own merits . I make no comment on the real argument just that this one is poorly constructed . Today is Jun 16 , 2010 . That 's 1 year 4 months 28 days . 17 months is `` a long time '' ?? 513 days ??? Really ? Bush was blaming Clinton for economic , trade and international events into his 2nd term and you were probably shouting `` Amen ! '' and now 17 months is `` a long time '' ??? Even a gop sycophant such as yourself can appreciate the irony of your position . Bush could never seem to get the Clinton monkey off his back but now he is absolved from all blame for the results of his best efforts ? Meanwhile , Dick Cheney has inserted himself into various discussions as an expert when he has proven total ineptness -LRB- remember how the Iraqis would welcome us with flowers just the French did when we liberated towns in WWII ??????? -RRB- . Fake News , your personal gop news service , harrumphed and kissed his ring . So , finally , we have an issue where he might actually be apt -LRB- hahaha ... I have to laugh when I see Cheney and `` apt '' in the same sentence !!! -RRB- and where is he ? It is a legitimate question . Barry the incompetent boob Obama , the inept bungler , issued drilling permits to that oil rig WITHOUT SAFETY INSPECTIONS . The Obama administration issued those permits , not Dick Cheney the civilian . Of course , we could always try asking Jim Whittingham -LRB- sp -RRB- about it , since his buckshot wounds have probably healed nicely by now . He was about to talk anyway before Cheney shot him in the face as a warning to any others who might consider spilling the beans , or oil , as the case may . We 'd also see that Cheney and Bush had planned the war in Iraq to get their grubby hands on their oil long before cooking up the WMD lies . Things are starting to unravel , Dickey Boy . Do n't forget to change your batteries . What 's good for the goose ... Posted by : WhitneyDavid | June 17 , 2010 12:27 PM | Report abuse Anyone think that SOB gives a rat 's about dead ecosystems ? Whose lax rules for big business created the environment for what happened on April 20 , 2010 ? So for all those pretending with glee that this is `` Obama 's Katrina '' . . let 's do open an investigation into why the rules were thrown to the wind , let 's open the files on those secret meetings , etc. -- our government became pure evil -LRB- i.e. , for corporations and rich cronies only -RRB- and lax -LRB- who cares , let 's make $ $ -RRB- during the last administration and we 'll probably find other areas we 'll have to clean up before it 's over . Cheney 's quiet because he knows what they created , and he 's quietly praying to his Satan to deliver him from his evil without having to go to jail . Dick Cheney is with Albert Haynesworth at the bank -- laughing at the rest of us . Dick Cheney has been one of the most vocal and partisan ex-VPs in our history . He has no problems with partisan attacks on the elected government officials from the other party . He has now problem criticizing every foreign policy initiative because he is n't in charge of it . True - this oil spill happened on Obama 's watch , and the current Administration is `` responsible '' . But the MMS leaders who should have been the first regulatory line were empowered in the Dick Cheney years . And Republicans have been totally obstructionist in allowing up or down votes on numerous new appointees to key Executive Branch jobs . They have a strategy to harm , harrass and delay anything the incoming Administration tries to do . Face it - this environmental disaster was predicted by many , and the Drill Baby Drill crowd pretended it could never happen -- and many of them -LRB- Dick Cheney at the lead -RRB- have tremendous personal financial incentives to support Big Oil with no strings attached . Voters for bush\\/cheney unwilling to admit their mistake , just like bush\\/cheney . Well , I 'm glad you asked , and the answer is THIRTY YEARS . When we recall the worst rulers in European history , people exchange knowing glances and solemnly say , `` We must never forget ... '' But when we recall the worst leaders in American history , conservatives look you straight in the eye and say , `` Time to forget ! Time to forget ! '' I share the angst of those watching the complete devastation of the area . However , regulation , or lack thereof have little to with this mess or the financial one proceeding it . Laissez faire means leave it alone , not turn a blind eye . BP officials are alone in the responsibility arena here . If you look at the laundry list of shortcuts taken to get back on schedule , it is clear that , as in the financial mess , that even the basic fundamentals of their business were ignored , so all the rules and regs in the world would not have changed a thing . They were willing to break them all . If our justice dept. does not arrest and convict the ones who ordered these actions , along with the ones who ordered the orders , then it will be clear that these corps rule our world and we do need new leadership . These BP officials must be convicted of negligent homicide at a minimum . As the officials at Goldman , et al , should have been tried for fraud . Let us never forget that eleven people lost their lives because BP could not wait a few more days for billions in revenue . Also , never forget , that every time we insert a nozzle in our fuel tanks , use plastic , and all the other petro-based products , we aid and abet , so , in a way , we are all responsible . And he 'll lay low because there IS no pro-oil position here as that moronic Joe Barton found out today . Ms. Katrina vanden Heuvel is a VERY left-winger who works for `` The Nation '' which has very extreme left-wing views . It 's really amazing how the new left-wing Democrat Party keeps reaching to the `` past '' . I guess that 's because their PERFORMANCE with everything else as been a real MESS ... This rich elite self-serving liberal\\/progressive likes to wear a lot of black clothes ... ... probably like the numbers ... .666 too ... . Who the hell cares ? He 's not VP anymore . All the attempts to blame Bush and Cheney for this -LRB- and everything else -RRB- does n't change that . The day Linda actually has something intelligent to say is the day Barack Hussein Obama releases his grades . OUCH !! Posted by : godwithfire55 | June 17 , 2010 1:32 PM | Report abuse This is a new definition of News : No wonder Newspapers like the Post are going out of business . Of course , Ms. Vanden Heuvel overlooks the most obvious reason for Dick Cheney remaining silent at this time : When your political opponent is busy shooting himself in different body parts every day , do n't do anything that might upset the trend . Mr. Cheney wo n't say a word until President Obama either runs out of bullets or body parts . Liz Cheney , his daughter , is probably hiding him out in her basement somewhere . Any other time you ca n't get that old scoundrel to shut the hell up . The real question is Where is Al Gore ? Oh yeah ... ... . he 's with his new girlfriend . Maybe he and John $ 400 Edwards are buddies now ... ... ... lol . The real question is Where is Al Gore ? Oh yeah ... ... . he 's with his new girlfriend . Maybe he and John $ 400 Edwards are buddies now ... ... ... lol . This is the president that you voted for . The administration is responsible for these permits and they did not do thier jobs . Bush and Cheny did not have anything to do with this . Actually they would have a better handle on this problem than this administration who 's only experience is in the class room Posted by : maryvpoole | June 17 , 2010 1:45 PM | Report abuse Nice try honey . Once again , desperate liberals are in high dudgeon trying to ensare their favorite boogeymen , Bush and Cheney , into this BP spill . Preznit Baruch Odinga is the Preznit , it happened on his watch . It 's his baby . No two ways about it . When this first happened , I thought that Cheney -LRB- and company -RRB- might have `` orchestrated '' this spill to upend and end the Obama presidency . Perhaps in some subversive , clandestine way , he and\\/or Halliburton set it up by selling bad products to BP . It 's not beyond the imagination . '' Gee whiz , you could use the same -LRB- empty -RRB- imagination as say that Obama may have orchestrated this , and the mining disaster in WV , and the natural gas explosion , as a way to further his cap-and-trade overly green agenda . But , it would n't be any fun if we did n't pull politics in on this , nor would it be any fun to not fault Bush\\/Cheney , blah blah blah . I guess the question is , who is to fault ? BP for one , because in the name of the almighty dollar , they cut costs and took risks . The Obama administration , because they have had their head so far up their butt and have done little except politicize this disaster . Turn down skimmers three days after it first happened ? Refuse help from 13 countries ? WHY ??? For love love of all those poor folks down there in the Gulf Coast - STOP TALKING , STOP POINTING FINGERS , and DO SOMETHING ! We do n't need another speech from Obama , or know that he 's on his fifth trip to the area ... I want to hear about money being poured into the area , giving shrimpers the equipment they need to help skim , or clean the beach , or the marshes . You hear NOTHING about a ramp up of resources , just more political BS ... Posted by : uncasquig | June 17 , 2010 1:49 PM | Report abuse I believe Cheney would say he 's for SAFE drilling ... like what has been done in the Gulf for 60 years with thousands of rigs . He 'd also point out that it was Halliburton that tried tell the BP people there that what they were doing was unsafe ... The difference between Cheney and vandenHeuvel is Cheney lives in the REAL WORLD . Were whether you like it or not we NEED oil . See Republicans support safe ways to drill for oil . In fact if this happened on land in ANWR it would have been capped in a DAY !!! It 's Liberals like vandenHeuvel that force oil companies to do deep sea oil drilling . . He who made his first priority in office the setting up of a new energy policy with secret meetings with his old partners . This disaster can be laid directly at the feet of Dick Cheney\\/George Bush 's so-called energy policy - really just a another scam to fleece the America people . Too bad you 're all too busy blaming them to actually start coming up with solutions . This article is thin on its connect the dot facts . The loose fittings to former employees getting jobs and dredging up the Energy Task Force 's lack of transparency are sad . Next time your calling Dick a dick , please do a better job . This article shows little research and does a poor job of bringing any new information to light . I feel like my 15 year old could write a better researched and more sufficient piece . Cheney is evil and deserves someone doing just that . Yes , Shrub and Dick left office 18 months ago , but the damage they did in 96 months takes more than 18 months to clean up . Finding all the regulations they gutted takes time , and then they have to be rebuilt to offer some semblance of protection for US citizens . Well , I 'm glad you asked , and the answer is THIRTY YEARS . Not for the rest of your lives ? Sarcasm aside , Katrina 's post was more of a sleazy hit piece than journalism . Innuendo , supposition and raw hatred does n't substitute for actual evidence . Voters for bush\\/cheney UNWILLING TO ADMIT their mistakes , \\*\\* just like bush\\/cheney . The atmosphere of relaxed and non existent regulation over any part large corporations reached it 's zenith under them . Particularly , they favored the oil industry . Both men were oil men and still have ties to the industry . Cheney will not say a word because he simply does not want to go on record at all . Silence is his protector . I 'm sure he 's up to no good . What I do n't understand is why President Obama just does n't take a boat out there and wave his hand over the water and make the oil stop ! After all he can cool down the planet and make sea levels stop rising . This should be easy for him . No doubt while he was with Haliburton Cheney and his big oil buddies were not only plotting tax cuts for the rich , but they put something in the oil so the Obama could n't use his superpowers to stop it , like he did when he paid all our mortgages gave free gas and health care . The question still remains where is the leader of Haliburton , whose company performed the cemeting of the well to discourage an eruption and explosion . Where is Mr. Cheney now ? We will leave out the fact that Haliburton ripped the taxpayers to the tune of over $ 100M in Iraq services for direct services to service members in the War theater . I lose count of all the unsubstantiated and irrelevant claims in this short piece . I 'm surprised she did n't refer to Cheney as a known homo sapien . Majority of BP 's lobbyist are former Democrat hill staffers . BP was out front on pushing cap-and-trade . Yet she wants to know where Cheney is at ? Get with reality lady ! God help the poor little neocommies who ca n't change their mind and wo n't change the subject . They know not what they do -LRB- but that does n't shut them up -RRB- . It 's perfectly legitimate to ask why this person who is the face of big oil has nothing to say all of a sudden when the POLICIES OF BUSH\\/CHENEY\\/SATAN are the reason it happened in the first place . Yet it is their fault , thay are to blame . It would be no different that asking sara i dont have a brain but mindless sheep love me palin if she still advocates drill baby drill in light of current circumstances . but anything more complex than american idol or one of those dance shows being over the heads of repiggers certainly is n't a surprise . that 's why there 's a whole industry of people making huge fortunes telling the what to think , because they 're not capable of it on their own . huge horde of mindless sheep who lack functioning brains Posted by : red2million | June 17 , 2010 2:29 PM | Report abuse Cheney is busy crafting fiction for real Amerikans . Living it up on his multi million dollar bonus from Arab oil company Halliburton . Arab Oil company Halliburton ; it is not based in Houston it has an office there same as BP do but it is an Arab oil company based in Dubai . It moved there to avoid US taxes and regulations . When Democrats stop driving cars and using oil-based energy resources , then and only then will they have the high ground on this issue . Until then , they really do n't have much to gain by finger-pointing . `` Murky ties to -LRB- the boogyman -RRB- Haliburton '' , ooooohhhhh .

The CURRENT administration just delivered the worst Oval Office address in this history of the Oval Office -LRB- yes , even worse than Jimmy the Sweater Wearing Peanut Farmer -RRB- . And the CURRENT administration has lost all credibility with the American people for its incompetence . Nothing you have had to say here changes that fact . But you keep going on blaming George Bush and Dick Cheney for your miserable life . I 'm sure that 's psychologically healthy . This paper reported on that last week , and it was around 40k that obama got from the cheney industry , with repukes getting ten times that amount . bull hockey , how wash , B.S. take your choice , but that 's just a complete crock and a joke of a suggestion . Everyone knows the history of cheney and big oil , and in fact many of the bushies had direct ties to the industry . but since you moronatards are always wrong as to the issues I understand that you have to believe in an alternate reality and grasp at straws . nice try , but obama has n't been sleeing with anyone tied to the cheney industry for the last two century or so as repiglets have . middle class people who vote republican are the dumbest people to ever live . joe barton was practically in tears , because helllooooh geniuses , him and his kind do n't work for you completeandutterfool they work for exxon mobil , and bp , and the insurance industry , et al. . god you people are blind ignorant mindless sheep . put down the paper and turn on american idol or some of that garbage , that 's all your little acorn brain can handle ! that 's why they pay rush and sean and the rest to think for you . quit trying to think for yourselves , that option does n't come with the conservative package Posted by : red2million | June 17 , 2010 2:51 PM | Report abuse For anyone looking for dicky cheney at any time , just rememeber this simple thing : he bears the mark of the beast and sits always at the right hand of Satan .

Go back to writing for your commie loving and failing magazine . Noooo , I believe she refers to the secret meeting Cheney held with the oil companies , including Halliburton\\/KBR and the most odd coincidence that Hallliburton\\/KBR scored incredibly lucrative contracts in both Iraq and Afghanistan . Cheney received deferred compensation from Halliburton even after taking office and he retained stock options . According to Cheney 's 2001 financial disclosure report , the vice president 's Halliburton benefits include three batches of stock options comprising 433,333 shares . He also has a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- retirement account valued at between $ 1,001 and $ 15,000 dollars . You 're a very angry little person , j. Deep cleansing breaths , and then into your jammies and off to bed with you ! I just wish she were not so angry about everything . It is several pages long , so most of you do n't have the attention span to read it . Look how long the ` Reagan deregulations ' of financial industries took to implode . And I am always looking for references to ACORN and Obama 's former preacher and that 1960 ' radical he had some vague dealings with . of executive privilege , with the blessings and condoning by the 5 to 4 vote of the conservative republican dominated US supreme court after 8 years of looting and plundering rode out into the sun set . Leaving behind a scorched , economically terror besieged , ideologically divided , polarized nation on a fast track of self destruction from within . Cheney the shooter opens his loud snotty mouth when he need to hype up the terror propaganda , foment hate , fear , wrap himself in the flag , fart patriotism , or churn up the republican patriotic feeding frenzy to control the hearts and minds of a mislead and gullible nation . Let lets the like of Karl Rove , Palin , Hannity , Glen Beck , Limbaugh . Ann Coulter and others do his bidding . We now continue to pay the price for their staggering incompetence and hatefulness . It was their mindless ideological pursuit of total deregulation that led to this mess . And no , it makes no difference that they have been out of office for months , they are still responsible . After all , Republicans of all stripes continue to blame Clinton , and even Carter , for the messes that those very same Republicans made . -- Haiti Earthquake : `` Dems made them sign a pact to -LRB- sic . -RRB- the Devil ... '' -- California Wildfires : `` If the Dems had n't stopped us from cutting all the trees down , this would n't have happened ... '' Deepwater Horizon : `` Those horrible Democrats are picking on poor little BP ... Awwwww ! '' Sometimes , you gotta fight fire with fire . I only wish that the Democratic Party had started to `` man-up '' sooner and stopped apologizing for being Progressive . This is their area of expertise , so why are they so quiet ? Is it that they only know how to make secret deals with the oil industry , and start wars that they can not justify , and do not know how to fight ? Where are these empty heads with mouths that do not stop ! agency overseeing their lovers , big oil . He should rot in hell . Do you see a conspiracy here or was this just a quick column spoken into your voice recorder on the way to work ? You had better look out the window and see if little black helicopters with Halliburton painted on the side are hovering outside your office . What significance does this article have to anything concerning the Gulf disaster ? While her post is nothing more than innuendo , I have found Cheney 's silence curious and more curiouser . This is a guy that ran the federal energy program for eight years , such as it was . To ask what role the Bush , and for that matter every administration going back to Reagan , had in this mess is not unfair or trying to blame Obama 's predecessor . That every major oil company had the same disaster plan on file , with the same errors and deficiencies should make all of us demand an accounting of what happened , why it happened , and just what in h#e@l*l is going to be done about it . For all any of us knows , Cheney may have some answers , and to think he might have been part of the problem is not far fetched . So , why has a man that probably knows more about the oil industry than anyone in the White House , and who has taken every opportunity to trash the Obama presidency , been so quiet on this matter ? Who f ` in cares where the VP from almost 2 years ago is now ? Grow up and join the present , maybe it will help you get over your anger for losing 8 years of your life to Bush hatred . All she wrote about are closed door meetings and some woman working for BP and is deliberately trying to make a spurious connection between Cheney and what is happening in the Gulf . Hell , even the Downing Street memos have more red meat than this . Why does n't she try telling us what took 57 days for the Federal government to actually do anything ? I do n't think it was because Cheney was standing in the way . He really belongs in jail for war crimes , and now crimes against the people of the coast . He really can not hide much longer and the Obama administration needs to call him to justice . Remember No One is above the law . However , I know where he should be and that is standing trial in The Hague . He is a criminal and should not be allowed to go free . They have the con now ! However , if my vote counts , they will not be -- I 'll never vote for any Republican again . Yeah , yeah , lets all forget about anything that did n't happen in the last year , and pretend like there is no cause and effect from previous actions -LRB- whoever 's actions , I do n't care who -RRB- that take time to work their way from twisted , high-profit dreams to explosive reality . I love me some right-wing , ` lets not regulate those guys ' folks wanting it all cleaned up in 10 seconds . The main goal is to not have these disasters to clean up at all . How does that happen ? Regulation is not enough either , you actually have to oversee and enforce -LRB- that cost money and requires people to be hired to actually DO that -RRB- , or it is just a good idea , not reality . I can already hear the screams of ` government interference ' from Big Oil , but they are happy to take massive tax incentives -LRB- they sure need a break , the paupers -RRB- and return it to shareholders who do n't pay the taxes or live in this country . Talk about sneaky redistribution of wealth ! It is fine to have the opinion that Big Oil is all good and this disaster is an act of God or whatever , but you really ca n't -LRB- logically -RRB- have it both ways . It is not realistic at all to want safe drilling and then refuse to pay for the oversight . How do you expect it will happen ? An immaculate oversight perhaps ? Which is more important , the cheap fuel , subsidised by enormous tax breaks to the most profitable businesses on the planet , or the expectation of safety and less risk of more such disasters ? Jesus , Mary , Joseph , he 's SILENT . This is something some of us have been awaiting since 2000 . PLEASE do n't try to lure him from his cave . A silent Dick is the best Dick . '' Now if we could just get Dick 's MiniMe Liz to shut up also . Along with all the right wing loonies who can only bash the current administration for what was the result of eight years of cronyism under the previous administration . While the righties delight in blaming Obama for this mess , they can not tolerate fingers being pointed at the real villain , Cheney , whose dark , secret shenanigans have caused the U.S. irreprable harm . Maybe 's not too late for ` Dick ` to face the music on corruption charges . Try getting money out of those guys when it collapses and kills hardworking Americans .

We need the adults in charge . The Republicans have done nothing but criticize Obama and then defend BP ! Proving once again that the majority of conservatives in this country are greedy and careless people who care only for their own coffers and nothing for the people who are enduring this crisis . The same kind of uncaring disregard those same Republicans had for the Katrina victims . Conservatives are a sorry , unpatriotic , unchristian and uncharitable lot .

People like Bachman will only start supporting the American people when the oil slick actually hits her state and Barton is obviously in bed with the oil companies . This does n't surprise me though . Cheney is a freakin coward ! And his absence during the oil spill is no different from his absence from military service during Veitnam . For those bloggers whose attitude is `` so what ! '' should consider what their attitudes were when Cheney was insatiably deriding everything the sitting President did to protect America .

From the nearly $ 100,000 in BP stock held by Rep. Frederick Upton -LRB- R-Mich . -RRB- to the nearly $ 650,000 in ConocoPhillips shares held by Sen. John F. Kerry -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- , lawmakers on five key panels with oversight of the oil industry held more than 110 assets in firms from that sector . All told , the members of the five House and Senate committees had a minimum of $ 11.4 million in stock holdings in the oil and gas industry , with a maximum value that could have exceed $ 16.8 million , according to an analysis of financial disclosure forms released Wednesday . Before the Gulf disaster , some lawmakers sold off shares in the companies at the center of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill for personal financial reasons . Among them was Kerry , whose wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry , sold off the last remaining shares she held in Transocean , the company that owned the drilling rig . At the end of 2009 , however , Heinz family trusts still held between $ 350,000 and $ 750,000 in BP stock , coming in purchases last year . House Minority Leader John Boehner -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- also bought as much as $ 50,000 worth of stock in the British oil giant , which owned the well which has been spewing oil since the April 20 explosion off the Louisiana coastline . Wednesday served as financial-disclosure day on Capitol Hill , the one day of the year when the media and government watchdogs get a glimpse into the personal assets and transactions of members of Congress . The lawmakers must show the value of their assets on Dec. 31 of the previous year , as well as any gifts received and financial transactions they took the year before . Federal laws only require members of Congress to provide a range of values for assets , and some ranged as widely as between $ 1 million and $ 5 million . Critics , including some members of Congress , have requested that lawmakers reveal their finances more regularly and with more detail , in order to prevent any appearance of conflict of interest between their financial holdings and their legislative portfolio . Kerry -- who is serving as the Senate Democrat 's lead negotiator on energy legislation -- has at least $ 6 million in financial assets from a dozen big oil and gas companies , including household names such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil , BP and ConocoPhillips . The senator defended his family 's financial holdings , saying his wife 's trusts from her first husband 's ketchup fortune would not deter him from taking on the oil industry . `` Senator Kerry has been the Senate 's best environmental champion for more than 25 years and has written and urged legislation to end our dependence on foreign oil . Inherited holdings in family trusts he has no control over whatsoever clearly have no impact on his fight for a green economy and a clean environment , '' Whitney Smith , Kerry 's spokeswoman , said in a statement . Sen. Christopher Bond -LRB- R-Mo . -RRB- , who in 2008 held between $ 1,000 and $ 15,000 in Transocean shares , sold off all of his holdings in that company in February 2009 , the disclosure forms show . Overall , some lawmakers saw their energy holdings grow . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- , a longtime promoter of alternative-energy legislation , saw her investment in Clean Energy Fuels -- billing itself as North America 's largest provider of natural gas for motor vehicles -- grow from a minimum of $ 15,000 to a minimum of $ 50,000 by the end of 2009 . That investment represents a small sliver of the speaker 's financial portfolio , which is run by her husband , investor Paul Pelosi , whose primary holdings consist of real estate -- including a Napa vineyard that continues to be valued at between $ 5 million and $ 25 million . Secretary of the Interior , Ken Salazar , White House energy czar , Carol Browner lied ! Now , how about this nest of snakes refuse to take any more money from Wall Street , banks , and all of those dirty corporations that outsource jobs ? Yet , if you look over these comments , and I 'm sure they 're representative of American public opinion , the main idea is to prevent compromised elected representatives from voting on matters in which they have a financial interest . But that 's just the frosting on the cake . The cake is rotten so why frost it ? All money has to be taken out of politics . That 's the only way to POSSIBLE reformation . The air waves , whic belong to us , but are used by private corporations making billions , do n't want to give up the air time . But someone has to force them to give it up . Have a fair way for candidates to be interviewed , selected and then voted upon by the general public . And ... did you see what these people who supposedly represent us are worth ? How can any thinking individual call this a representative democracy ? These elected official are not like you and I. This is an oligarchy , as plain as the nose on your face . Why are the majority of people in this country - who as a group would like rules to prevent legislative conflicts of interest - so unable to make these changes in law ? How do we change laws in a way that that will negatively impact lawmakers ? Can you understand that you can place your investments into the hands of a financial advisor and allow them to make investment decisions for you ? Do you also understand that several Senators , -LRB- both Republican and Democrat -RRB- who are worth millions , are holding up legislation as a kind of blackmail to continue the Bush tax cuts for the upper 1 % who pay a 15 % tax rate on their investments instead of the 35 % rate the rest of us poor slobs have to pay on our salaries ? `` I am throwing my hands up in the air -LRB- again -RRB- . '' What are you trying to tell us ? That the politicians found their moral compass ' or that the stock price of oil companies have been taking a pounding on the market over the last few months and they found they needed to dump it before they lost their shirts . Why are the majority of people in this country - who as a group would like rules to prevent legislative conflicts of interest - so unable to make these changes in law ? How do we change laws in a way that that will negatively impact lawmakers ? That covers just about all of them . Do you hear that , Dick Cheney ? The Grand Old Party - poster child for corruption in government , human rights abuses and toal unmitigated incompetence . Welcome to the `` new '' era of accountability where crimials run the country in broad day light . Change you can believe in . THIS IS HOW OUR GOVERNMENT BECAME SO CORRUPT . THIS OIL SPILL WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IF THE GREEDY POLITICIANS WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND ECOLOGY RATHER THAN HOW MUCH MONEY THEY COULD MAKE BY NOT OVER SEEING THE WAY BIG OIL WAS HANDLING THEIR WELLS . However , it is trivial . There is much more dirt under the rugs re oil stock and much more . It could be reported and it will not . What should follow is serious investigative reporting and serious digging for conflicts of interest , which are often not on the surface . They may never show up on the beaches , but may destroy them nonetheless . There are other conflicts of interest , and we await reports on them . In the meantime , I recall an article published on the web titled `` Senators Reveal Their Finances . '' It revealed hideous conflicts of interest , other violations of the law by Pelosi , Reid , Connell , McConnell , and Kennedy . IT WAS then PULLED FROM THE WEB and REPLACE with another ARTICLE : the title remained the same . Paul Kane , are you up to the task ? Can you bring the people some facts ? For mounting reasons my heart cries out more for the animals than for those -LRB- people -RRB- affected by the disaster who let corruption reign for so long until now , hopefully . Way to hold the line Senator ! You idiots see your rant stay in the text box and think it has n't posted . Learn how to use the machinery before blasting away , thank you . For mounting reasons my heart cries out more for the animals and less for those -LRB- people -RRB- affected by the disaster who let corruption reign for so long until now , hopefully .

I would bet , if known , Obama and the rest of his Chicago Mafia Thugs and the other congressional Democrats and a few Repubs as well dumped their stock . Could this be constrused as `` insider trading '' ? These double - standard crooks should be put in jail ! Senators , Representatives and high-level officials in the executive branch should not own shares of stock as long as they hold office . Otherwise the potential conflict of interests is obvious . Another example of wealthy politicians appearing to being beholden to special interest groups . Doing so is a blatant conflict of interest .

Tuesday June 15th s hearing with Oil Executives on C-Span is a real awakening to the Corruption of Oil Politicians in allowing Oil companies to Operate in American waters with Fraudulent plans for Safety and Emergency Response as they Defend BP and fight against Reparations for the People and Resources of the Gulf Coast . The defense of these worthless 500 page plans and lack of Insurance by Republican Congressmen is Criminal and Disgusting . If an Oil company or workers Job is to Destroy our Land and Water then you should NOT have your Uninsured Butt in our Waters . The Oil money that has soaked these politicians is a rotting stain on their States and our Nation .

'' `` And we care about the small people , '' added Svanberg , who is Swedish . `` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care . But that is not the case indeed . We care about the small people . '' Just like that , a new slogan was born . It sardonically swept through cyberspace and landed in the gulf , where it was greeted with no more enthusiasm than the unrefined crude gushing from BP property . `` We 're not small people . We 're human beings . They 're no greater than us . We do n't bow down to them . We do n't pray to them , '' said Justin Taffinder of New Orleans . `` Purely a translation matter , '' e-mailed BP spokesman Scott Dean . And later Wednesday , Svanberg apologized for his apology : `` I spoke clumsily this afternoon , and for that , I am very sorry . '' BP 's European executives have consistently struggled to strike the right tone in response to the oil spill . Svanberg was the guy who was supposed to demonstrate all the humility that Tony Hayward , the company 's chief executive , ca n't quite muster . Early on , Hayward outraged Gulf Coast residents and officials when he pledged to honor `` all legitimate claims , '' then scoffed , when asked for examples of illegitimate claims : `` I could give you lots of examples . This is America -- come on . We 're going to have lots of illegitimate claims . We all know that . '' Later , Hayward complained : `` There 's no one who wants this over more than I do . I would like my life back .

The amount of money BP said it would plunk into an escrow fund for oil-spill claims is enough to cover the entire NASA budget for a year . It 's enough to buy all the shares of the Kellogg Co. . And it 's larger than the annual economic output of 90 countries . But BP is an unusual company . It made profits of $ 5.6 billion in the first quarter of this year and $ 14 billion in 2009 . It produces about 2.5 million barrels a day of crude oil from Russia to Angola , from Britain 's North Sea to Alaska 's North Slope . Until Wednesday , BP also had been planning to pay out $ 10.5 billion in dividends this year , which would still have left it with $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in spare cash . It could raise the money for the escrow fund this year without borrowing another dime . That arsenal of cash and crude has n't been enough to placate the Obama administration , however , as the company wades through the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history . And BP has struggled to convince markets that it can meet its obligations to both investors and victims of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . In eight weeks , BP stock has fallen to about half its earlier value . On Tuesday , Fitch Ratings slashed the firm 's credit rating to BBB , two rungs above junk . And early on Wednesday morning , investors in credit default swaps -- an insurance-like financial instrument -- were pricing an almost 40 percent chance the oil giant would default on its debts within five years . So although the deal struck at the White House on Wednesday was designed in part to reassure Gulf Coast residents that BP would put aside enough money for their claims , it was also designed to give shareholders a sense that the financial damage was manageable and could , over time , be contained along with the oil spill . That 's why one thing BP asked in exchange for the big escrow fund was a signal from President Obama that he was not trying to run the firm out of business . `` BP is a strong and viable company , '' the president said after his meeting with BP 's chairman and top executives , `` and it is in all of our interests that it remain so . '' That is hard to accept for many Americans who want to punish BP . But anything else might be counterproductive . So far , the company , drawing on its worldwide operations , has paid for everything from National Guard troops to air quality testing by the Environmental Protection Agency , from $ 5,000 checks for shrimpers to the $ 100 million or so for each relief well . `` This agreement underscores that as long as we need oil , Big Petroleum is better than Bankrupt Petroleum , '' Lincoln Mayer , a lawyer specializing in energy and antitrust at McDermott Will & Emery , said in an e-mail . `` Few companies could afford a $ 20 billion mistake . BP is one of them , and that 's a good thing . '' Investment analysts appeared reassured after the White House meeting . `` It takes the political heat off the company and it steadies the ship in rough waters , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer . `` BP is stabilizing its financial position so it can handle cleanup costs and damages . '' BP stock rose 1.4 percent on Wednesday , closing at $ 31.85 a share . And the cost of BP credit default swaps dipped slightly , indicating a bit less anxiety about corporate default . So how does a company come up with $ 20 billion ? BP 's chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , said the firm will suspend its dividend for three quarters , starting with the payment that had been scheduled for Monday . That will give it $ 7.8 billion in cash .

There were also apologies from BP 's chairman of the board , Carl-Henric Svanberg -- to the president in the Roosevelt Room , and then to the American people when Svanberg and his grim-faced fellow executives went before the cameras in the White House driveway . Both sides got what they wanted out of the encounter . The administration , under fire for how it has responded to the environmental calamity , can boast of creating a huge pot of money for easing the pain of Gulf Coast residents . BP , though poorer on paper in the short run , got some much-needed clarity on its long-term liability , plus an explicit statement from Obama that the administration does n't want to see BP driven into bankruptcy . `` BP is a strong and viable company , and it is in all our interests that it remain so , '' Obama said in remarks to reporters in the State Dining Room . `` This is about accountability . At the end of the day , that 's what every American wants and expects . '' The morning meeting , which ran several hours longer than expected , was Obama 's first face-to-face encounter with BP executives since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in a fireball April 20 . Although their partnership of necessity has been strained by the continuing spill , which , according to recent estimates , has dumped upward of 85 million gallons of oil into the gulf , the administration and BP officials hammered out the key details of their agreement over several days prior to the White House session . Under the deal , BP will pay $ 5 billion annually over the next four years into an escrow account for damage claims from the gulf , setting aside an equivalent amount of U.S. assets as collateral until the fund reaches $ 20 billion . The figure is not a cap on the potential damages , and the company received no liability waiver as part of the agreement . The thorniest issue in recent days , however , appears to have been resolved with a compromise . Since last week , administration officials have said that BP should pay the lost wages of oil industry workers sidelined by the administration 's six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling . That stance put BP 's stock price in a nose dive , and BP officials made clear that such claims would be beyond the pale . Instead , the president Wednesday asked BP for a voluntary contribution to a foundation that will support unemployed oil industry employees . BP agreed , offering $ 100 million . `` We made clear that we do not think this is a liability for the company . The president said he 's concerned about those workers . He asked if there was something we could do as a voluntary gesture , '' said Jamie Gorelick , a Washington lawyer who serves as an adviser to BP and sat in on the White House meeting . Asked if BP had requested a statement from Obama affirming that BP should remain strong and viable , Gorelick did not answer directly , saying : `` We know what it looks like when a company is driven into bankruptcy . The claims that come first are the creditors , then the employees , then the environmental claims , and then the likes of shrimpers . This would not be a good result for anyone ... I do n't think the administration needs persuasion of this . '' Obama participated at various times in the discussions , which senior administration officials described as a `` negotiation , '' and met alone afterward with Svanberg . Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also participated in much of the session , a sign of the potential criminal liability the oil company may face . `` We have made it clear to the president that words are not enough . We understand that we will and we should be judged by our actions , '' Svanberg said when he faced the cameras after the meeting . He added , `` I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the American people on behalf of all the employees of BP , many of whom are living on the Gulf Coast . '' He said BP for the rest of this year will not pay dividends to shareholders . The new fund will be administered by Kenneth Feinberg , the Washington lawyer who oversaw a similar fund for victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks and who more recently was the Obama administration 's special master for executive compensation at firms receiving federal bailout money . Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , who is managing the federal response to the spill , said Wednesday that BP has already paid $ 81 million in claims , exceeding the $ 75 million cap on damages established by federal law two decades ago after the Exxon Valdez disaster . `` The president 's goal , as he said in the meeting , is to make sure there are adequate funds to help the people of the gulf get back on their feet , '' said Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , who attended the meeting . `` Those are his shareholders , and that 's who he 's trying to protect . '' As the two sides were meeting in Washington , BP announced that it had begun using a second containment system to capture oil leaking from the well , which according to the latest scientific estimate is gushing between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day -LRB- 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons -RRB- . The new technique pulls oil and gas from the blowout preventer and up to a surface rig called the Q4000 , using one of the lines that had been employed to pump heavy drilling mud into the well during the ill-fated `` top kill '' attempt last month . BP did not reveal the quantities involved . At best , the new process can handle 10,000 barrels a day , the company has said . BP 's controversial chief executive , Tony Hayward , made no public statement after meeting with Obama , but he will testify Thursday before a House subcommittee . In prepared remarks released in advance , Hayward says he is `` deeply sorry '' and adds , `` I fully grasp the terrible reality of the situation . '' Congress received from the White House on Wednesday a $ 15 million request to fund the commission Obama has appointed to study the future of offshore drilling . Its work is supposed to conclude in six months . Wednesday 's Obama-BP meeting came a day after the president 's fourth visit to the gulf , a two-day trip that took him to Mississippi , Alabama and the Florida Panhandle . His experience seemed fresh in his mind . He said he told Svanberg in their private meeting that `` for the families I met with down in the gulf , for the small-business owners , for the fishermen , for the shrimpers , this is not just a matter of dollars and cents . '' `` A lot of these folks do n't have a cushion , '' he said . `` They were coming off Rita and Katrina , coming off the worst economy that this country has seen since the Great Depression , and this season was going to be the season where they were going to be bouncing back .

Barton to retract apology to BP By Aaron Blake and Paul Kane Thursday , June 17 , 2010 ; 5:11 PM Under pressure from Republican leaders who threatened to remove him from a ranking committee position , Rep. Joe Barton -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- late Thursday retracted his apology to BP CEO Tony Hayward for the way his company has been treated by the U.S. government -- a comment that had drawn heavy criticism from both parties . Barton made that apology to Hayward in his opening statement Thursday morning before Hayward 's testimony to the House subcommittee , in which Barton decried the Obama administration for pressuring BP to open a $ 20 billion escrow account and to suspend dividend payments for the rest of the year . The ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said such arrangements have no legal basis , and that the political pressure exerted on the corporation in the midst of an investigation is a `` tragedy of the first proportion . '' `` I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday , '' Barton said in the morning . `` I apologize . '' Barton called the escrow account , which will be distributed independently , a `` slush fund '' and said the situation amounted to a `` shakedown '' by the White House . He said if he , as a congressman , asked for something similar from a corporation he was investigating , he could go to jail . Later Thursday , when House Republican leaders called his statement `` wrong , '' Barton first said he was sorry for the `` misconstruction '' of his comments , then later put out a statement retracting his apology to BP . According to a GOP leadership aide , Barton met with House Minority Leader John Boehner -LRB- Ohio -RRB- and Minority Whip Eric Cantor -LRB- Va. -RRB- Thursday afternoon , and was told , `` Apologize , immediately . Or you will lose your -LRB- subcommittee -RRB- position , immediately . Now that he has apologized , we 'll see what happens going forward . '' Another aide said Barton would now not be removed unless he goes on `` the TV circuit '' and causes further controversy . The aides requested anonymity to discuss the private discussions of the Republican leaders . In his statement , Barton said , `` I apologize for using the term ` shakedown ' with regard to yesterday 's actions at the White House in my opening statement this morning , and I retract my apology to BP ... I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident . '' BP 's Hayward said in testimony at the hearing that he does n't think the $ 20 billion escrow account amounts to a `` slush fund . '' Pressed by Rep. Bruce Braley -LRB- D-Iowa -RRB- , Hayward repeatedly declined to give a yes-or-no answer about whether he thought the situation represented a `` shakedown . '' Almost immediately following Barton 's morning comments , the liberal blogs and Democratic campaign operatives sprang into action and the White House denounced Barton . Even before Barton 's comments , Democrats had been attempting to connect Republicans to BP , noting the many contributions GOP congressmen have received from it and other oil companies .

The Washington Post obtained a copy of Kendall 's prepared testimony late Wednesday . `` While there is ample opportunity to improve and strengthen the regulations that govern MMS and the industry that extracts valuable resources from federal lands , the greatest challenge in reorganizing and reforming MMS lies with the culture -- both within MMS and within industry , '' Kendall intends to tell lawmakers . The agency 's inspectors are not only underpaid and inadequately trained but are also faced with having to oversee too many rigs , she says in her prepared testimony . About 60 MMS inspectors oversee 4,000 facilities in the Gulf of Mexico , Kendall notes , while the Pacific Coast has 10 inspectors for 23 facilities . Kendall 's testimony was first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal . Kendall documented improper behavior by MMS offshore regulators in a report last month , and she intends to say that new ethics rules imposed last year by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar address only part of the problem . `` But how do we address the conduct of industry representatives ? '' the prepared testimony says . `` Perhaps it is time to impose some ethics requirements on companies doing business with the government . '' Kendall also questioned the approach MMS has applied to investigating the Deepwater Horizon disaster , noting that the agency `` is bound by the Coast Guard regulations , which are comprehensive , but in my view , completely backwards , gathering evidence via public hearing , rather than developing evidence to culminate in a public forum .

But the British businessman 's apology before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was upstaged by another one . Rep.

Then , late in the afternoon , he apologized for his apology after party leaders threatened to oust him from his position as ranking Republican on the committee . Barton prompted the uproar with his opening statement at the hearing . `` I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday , '' he said . `` I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown .

Joe L. Barton -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- , who has received more than $ 100,000 in campaign contributions from the oil industry during this election cycle , revealed Thursday that he may be the only person in America who believes that BP deserves an apology for the way it has been treated during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Although Barton later retracted his suggestion that BP was the victim of a White House `` shakedown '' -- after House GOP leaders threatened to take away his position as ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee -- the episode showed the uncomfortable spot in which some Republicans find themselves . This is not the moment to be seen as coddling Big Oil . The GOP leadership has laid out a set of talking points that spread blame in all directions -- toward the company , the White House and the regulators who looked the other way . But some Republicans are having trouble bringing themselves to say anything bad about an industry that has been so good to them . It was notable that in their statement distancing themselves from Barton , House Republican leaders John A. Boehner -LRB- Ohio -RRB- , Eric Cantor -LRB- Va. -RRB- and Mike Pence -LRB- Ind. -RRB- referred to the spill -- caused by the explosion of an oil rig -- as a `` natural '' disaster . The oil industry `` has deep pockets , and they have a long history of supporting Republicans , '' said political consultant John Weaver , a former strategist for John McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign . `` Like any kind of addiction , it 's a terribly difficult thing to break . '' To some Republicans , the defense of the oil industry has more to do with their belief in free enterprise and their wariness of regulation . The debate over drilling has been a core part of their argument for less government . This may not be the best moment to be making that argument , either . For the GOP leadership , it has n't been easy to get their people to stick to the script : Blame Obama , but scold BP . -LRB- The problem with message discipline is , it requires discipline -RRB- . It is n't just Barton . Rep. Michele Bachmann -LRB- R-Minn . -RRB- called the $ 20 billion escrow account a `` redistribution of wealth fund . '' Rep. Tom Price -LRB- R-Ga -RRB- accused the Obama administration of `` Chicago-style shakedown politics . '' Sarah Palin has gone so far as to suggest that the real fault for the catastrophe in the gulf lies with the environmental movement . On June 1 , the former Alaska governor and former vice presidential nominee sent this message out on Twitter : `` Extreme Greenies : see now why we push ` drill , baby , drill ' of known reserves & promising finds in safe onshore places like ANWR -LRB- the Alaskan Natural Wildlife Refuge -RRB- ? Now do you get it ? '' If that kind of spin seems out of touch with public outrage , the GOP also risks falling out of step with parts of its own base . Among some evangelicals , for instance , there is a growing environmental movement . In a blog post the same day as Palin 's Twitter fusillade , Southern Baptist theologian Russell Moore suggested that the oil spill should be the same kind of call to arms for conservative Christians as the Roe v. Wade decision establishing abortion rights was nearly four decades ago . `` For too long , we evangelical Christians have maintained an uneasy ecological conscience , '' he wrote . `` Because we believe in free markets , we 've acted as though this means we should trust corporations to protect the natural resources and habitats .

Responding to what they variously described as a `` savage grilling , '' a hypocritical spectacle and even a `` Stalinist show trial , '' tabloids bristled at perceived anti-British sentiment in Thursday 's hearing on the BP oil spill disaster by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce . British politicians , for their part , generally steered clear of the controversy . But one senior member of Prime Minister David Cameron 's government expressed sympathy for the Obama administration . Chris Huhne , secretary of state for energy and climate change , said : `` We have to put this in the context of the environmental crisis that Barack Obama is facing in the Gulf of Mexico . '' Speaking live on the BBC 's current affairs show `` Question Time , '' Huhne took a swipe at tabloids lamenting the alleged anti-British rhetoric coming out of Washington . `` I recognize there is , particularly in parts of the tabloid press , a strong lobby which would like us to re-fight the American War of Independence , '' he said . While `` some of the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- rhetoric is clearly over the top , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague `` did n't find it was anti-British and reported back on that , '' Huhne said . `` But it is clearly anti-BP and anti-big oil for the understandable reasons that this is an environmental catastrophe which has cost lives and livelihoods . '' Cameron came to BP 's defense Thursday during a visit to Brussels , calling the British oil giant `` an important multinational company '' that is not only vital to Britain but is `` also important , I would argue , to the United States . '' He said BP `` recognizes that it has huge obligations and it will have to spend a huge amount of money '' to contain and plug its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , clean up the spill and pay appropriate compensation . But tabloids and their readers lashed out over what they described as the six-hour interrogation of Hayward by grandstanding congressmen . London 's Daily Mail said Hayward , a 53-year-old British geologist who has been chief executive of BP for three years , `` was subjected to a grilling so savage yesterday that it was more like ancient Rome than Capitol Hill . '' It said the `` hapless boss and his company '' were treated like `` Public Enemy No. 1 . '' Hayward `` was always going to get a caning from U.S. congressmen playing to the gallery , '' the Daily Express said in an editorial . `` Cheap lines about taking his ` golden parachute back to England ' revealed the anti-British prejudice that was at work . '' The editorial continued : `` The insatiable demand for oil of the American lifestyle is what has prompted the need for so much inherently risky deep-water drilling . Until the Americans take action to curtail this demand then their complaints amount to nothing more than the squealing of hypocrites . '' A news story in the paper said Thursday 's hearing `` took on the style of a Stalinist show trial . '' It quoted Richard Branson , the British magnate who chairs the Virgin Group , as accusing Obama of `` unseemly behavior '' for repeatedly `` kicking a company while it was on its knees . '' Branson said BP `` deserves to be criticized , '' but that so do U.S. government regulators . The Sun joined the indignant reporting . The paper 's business editor wrote that the hearing had a `` distasteful anti-British feel . '' British actress Helen Mirren also took some flak in the British press Friday for criticizing BP on the `` Late Show '' with David Letterman . Writing in the Daily Express , columnist James Delingpole said Mirren 's `` treachery '' would not be easily forgiven . `` She has ganged up with President Obama in his cheaply xenophobic and quite appallingly unfair campaign to make out that the BP oil spill is somehow Britain 's fault , '' he said . Daily Mail columnist Philip Norman agreed : `` One might have thought that a Dame of the British Empire who has portrayed the Queen -LRB- and , in many American eyes , is almost inseparable from her -RRB- would try in some graceful , light-hearted way to counteract the decidedly anti-British rhetoric coming from a grandstanding President Obama . '' Online commenters weighed in with more criticism . `` So these are the rulers of the most powerful nation on earth , '' a `` Mr. Grimsdale '' wrote on the Daily Mail 's Web site . `` I think the rest of us should be worried , very worried by this bunch of ignorant potato heads with their fingers on the nuclear button . '' On the Sun 's Web site , a writer named `` dispondant '' complained : `` It was an accident for god 's sake . Do the yanks think it was done on purpose ... Obama needs to back off & let BP get on with the job in hand they dont need a prat of a president posturing about & getting in the way .

Lobbyists typically represent multiple clients , and it is unknown how many of the events were intended to advance BP 's interests . The numbers are based on fundraiser data compiled by the Sunlight Foundation , which collects information from anonymous donors and lobbyist reports . The list is incomplete , and it is possible the lobbyists held other fundraisers as well . Nine of the 11 known fundraisers this year were hosted by lobbyist Tony Podesta or other lobbyists for his firm , the Podesta Group , who represent the company as well as many other interests . Since the Deepwater Horizon rig 's explosion in the gulf on April 20 , here are the fundraisers by lobbyists who represent BP : -- Paul Brathwaite and Cristina Antelo , who both lobby for the Podesta Group , were among numerous hosts for a May 26 party benefiting CHC-BOLD PAC , a PAC for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus . -- Tim Glassco , also a lobbyist for the Podesta Group , was a host of a `` young professionals '' happy hour on May 25 for Rep. Glenn Nye -LRB- D-Va . -RRB- . -- Dan Meyer , a lobbyist for the Duberstein Group , was a host of an April 29 event for Carly Fiorina , who was seeking the GOP nomination for a California U.S. Senate seat . -- Podesta and his wife , Heather , hosted an April 28 breakfast for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz -LRB- D-Fla -RRB- . Other oil and gas concerns have raised cash for lawmakers , too , sometimes with uncomfortable timing . On May 12 , executives including BP 's chairman , Lamar McKay , Transocean chief executive Steve Newman and Halliburton 's Timothy Probert appeared before a hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee to discuss responsibility for their respective roles in the Deepwater Horizon spill . About an hour earlier , House Republicans had gathered a few blocks away for an `` oil and gas breakfast '' fundraiser with industry members to benefit Rep. Kevin Brady -LRB- R-Tex -RRB- . David Donnelly , of the Campaign for Fair Elections , said he was n't surprised that fundraisers were held by the lobbyists of BP and other oil firms . `` The fundraising season in Washington never ends , even when there are disasters like in the Gulf Coast and when the economy crashes . Members of Congress still have to look for money , '' Donnelly said . Donnelly also expressed concern about campaign contributions to Rep. Joe Barton -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- , who apologized to the company Thursday for what he said was a White House `` shakedown '' in pressing BP to set aside $ 20 billion to compensate victims of the spill . Later in the day , GOP leaders demanded that Barton retract his apology and stress BP 's responsibility for the spill . Barton , who was elected to Congress in 1984 , has received $ 27,000 in campaign contributions from BP and its affiliates and $ 1.4 million from the oil and gas industry as a whole , according to campaign finance records . `` It 's amazing that Rep. Barton would stand up for a multinational corporation that has wrecked the livelihoods of so many people along the Gulf Coast , '' Donnelly said . `` Comments like this make all Americans question whether Congress represents them or the special interests funding their campaigns .

They clutch cans of beer . On the wooden deck of Griffin 's Marina and Ice , they recoil when approached , like a nest of vipers . `` We used to be fishermen , '' one sneers , drunk , seething with wounded pride . `` But now we work for BP . '' They wo n't say more than that . From their perch , they glare across the silent street at the gorgeous marshland now closed to fishing . At dusk they screech away in pickup trucks , barely pausing at the town 's one blinking traffic light . They surrender Leeville to shadow , to the mosquitoes , to what used to be and now is n't , to a solemn reality captured in two words that embody the collapse of a way of life . At the blinking traffic light , most drivers turn right and glide over the bayou to Port Fourchon , which services 90 percent of deep-water drilling structures in the Gulf of Mexico . Then it 's on to Grand Isle , a paradise for sunbathers and beachfront property owners . Confused drivers proceed through the light , past the sign that says `` NO OUTLET , '' past two gas stations , four RV parks , a half-dozen bait-and-tackle shops , two motels and one bar , then run smack into a `` ROAD CLOSED '' sign just before pavement halts at the marsh . About a mile long , hugged by bayou , full-time home to a handful of people . No more than 60 . Maybe not even 30 . Right now there should be hundreds of visiting fishermen leasing their own heavenly corner of the town 's bayou front , but with waters closed by the Deepwater Horizon leak , there 's no reason to come , no reason to stay . For decades , storm surges have swallowed 14 square miles every year in the basins of Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes . Last year the state redirected Highway 1 around Leeville to elevate the hurricane evacuation route . The town 's only thoroughfare became a dead end . Now residents worry that a hurricane will drench the area with oil this summer , killing the root structure that keeps the very earth together . `` To me , Leeville was gone 20 years ago , '' says Windell Curole , general manager of the South Lafourche Levee District , who says the town was 90 percent marsh in the '60s and is now 90 percent underwater . `` When we did not take the action to protect the marshes around Leeville , that was the beginning of the end .

Perhaps no one in America knows this better than Kenneth R. Feinberg . The nation 's unofficial authority on disbursing massive relief funds oversaw the paying out of billions of dollars for families of those who died in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and the Virginia Tech shootings . His phone rang once again this month , not long before word began to spread in Washington about such a fund for victims of the gulf oil spill . BP executives contacted Feinberg to see whether he would be willing to take the job . He agreed , and President Obama signed on . There is no blueprint for this kind of work , or at least there was n't until Feinberg and the small , loyal team that has worked with him for years created one in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks . After nearly a decade , they have gotten this difficult , contentious task down to something of a science . Feinberg flew to Mississippi and Louisiana on Friday to get started . He began by surveying the mess and meeting with governors . On Monday , he is scheduled to go to Houston to talk to BP executives . The company has already received an estimated 50,000 claims . Tens of thousands more could come its way . Back in Washington , Feinberg 's team was busy setting the machinery of the fund in motion . A Washington lawyer in private practice , he has worked with the same three people for decades : His brother , David ; the firm 's longtime business manager , Camille Biros ; and his law partner , Michael Rozen . They began arranging town hall meetings across the region , where frustrated people can vent their concerns and find out how to file claims . They set up 800-numbers and readieda Web site . In the coming weeks , they will hire scores of local lawyers , accountants , environmental experts and database engineers to staff community offices across five states . With the Sept. 11 and Virginia Tech funds , Feinberg 's team worked for free . This time , the operation will be funded by BP , and the company will pay the team a salary -LRB- it has not disclosed how much -RRB- . Feinberg , 64 , says his biggest obstacle will be earning the trust of a deeply suspicious population . Supremely confident and blunt-spoken in pinstripes and French cuffs , he is the picture of the Washington superlawyer -- albeit with an unmistakable Boston accent . But he must convince beleaguered shrimpers and bait shop owners and marsh boat captains that he is not there to represent BP or the government . Getting them to quickly settle their claims through the escrow fund instead of suing BP is critical to the success of the compensation program . `` This program can not be run from Washington , D.C. , '' Feinberg said in a news conference Friday after a two-hour meeting in Jackson , Miss. , with Gov. Haley Barbour -LRB- R -RRB- . `` You have to come down here to the states affected by this spill and hear firsthand what 's being done , what needs to be done , to provide prompt , fair , impartial compensation for people with a legitimate claim . '' `` Do not assume that everybody 's going to file a claim that should file a claim , '' Feinberg warned . `` There are people in our country very skeptical of a program like this , worried about it . ` It 's too complicated . ' ` I 'm not sure what I have to submit . ' ' I do n't trust them . ' ` I 'm worried . ' ` I 'm frustrated . ' ` I 'm angry . ' '' Barbour offered his help in introducing Feinberg , telling his state 's residents that the man from Washington was `` somebody that everybody can trust . '' Obama and BP have given Feinberg carte blanche to establish an independent system to compensate those affected by the oil spill . `` It is my program , '' Feinberg said , noting that it has `` my imprimatur on it , not the administration or BP . '' Feinberg declined to comment for this article . Over the years , Feinberg has helped settle some of the nation 's most complicated legal disputes , including a class-action lawsuit by Vietnam veterans over the use of Agent Orange , the government 's Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund that distributed $ 7 billion to the 5,500 survivors and families of the dead , and the Hokie Spirit Fund that compensated families of the victims of the 2007 mass shootings at Virginia Tech . Obama also named him the `` pay czar '' overseeing executive compensation under the government 's Troubled Assets Relief Program . Each time he and his team wade in , they must establish guidelines so that people understand how the money is being doled out . It can be a touchy business ; inevitably there are those who believe they got too little and others got too much . `` You start thinking about how many different layers there are to this ; it 's a lot , '' said Rozen , Feinberg 's law partner . `` It 's the sheer enormity of all of this that cuts across so many different kinds of livelihoods , whether they be commercial fishermen or independent contractors or oil rig workers or tourist venues . '' Feinberg 's role is not to side with the victims , but to be an impartial arbitrator . `` We 're not looking to be an advocate -- pro or con , '' Rozen said . `` It 's a pretty simple set of instructions : to find the best way to compensate victims or people who have been harmed here by this disaster in the most efficacious and expeditious kind of way . '' Asked in an interview whether Feinberg might be cast in the South as a distrustful Yankee , Barbour said his accent is n't an issue . `` And the fact that he used to work for Senator Kennedy is n't an issue either , '' Barbour joked , noting Feinberg 's job in the 1970s as chief of staff to the late senator Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . `` He has to just be straightforward and upright , '' Barbour said , `` gather around others who have no ax to grind but want this to be a fair process , and then conduct it in a way that is open .

But here in the bayou , where rich oyster beds have provided livelihoods to many and brought wealth to a few , people worry just how far BP 's handouts will go . `` They may satisfy the shrimpers and crabbers , but for the oystermen , they do n't realize how much money it is going to take if this becomes a long-term effect , '' said Mitchell Jurisich , 47 , a third-generation Croatian American oysterman who 's done well for himself helping oversee a business that rakes the mollusks out of these brackish waters . The $ 5,000 claim checks that BP has already given out have largely gone to fishermen , deckhands and captains , Jurisich and other oystermen point out . The $ 20 billion fund may be enough to pay off the little guys or small-boat owners whom President Obama promised to look after . But what about the not-so-little guys and salespeople ? What about the kings of the oyster trade such as Jurisich and the man he sells his catch to -- Eddie Kurtich , who 's spent 40 years building himself a booming business as an oyster broker ? Kurtich , 66 , works as a middleman selling shellfish by the tractor-trailer-load to shucking houses , seafood distributors and restaurants in Alabama , Kent Narrows along Maryland 's Eastern Shore , and others in Virginia , Texas , Florida and North Carolina . He , along with a few partners and other Croatians in the area , lease about one-quarter of the 400,000 state-owned acres available for oystering in southern Louisiana . He is one of the most successful members of a business run largely by immigrants from Croatia and their offspring . With a full head of white hair and a round face , Kurtich -- who sports two gold chains and a chunky 18-karat gold ring with a circle of white diamonds surrounding a single brown diamond -- seems content with success in his first-floor office in his Mediterranean-style home near the bayou . Right now , though , in the heart of the oyster harvesting season , he ca n't figure out how much of that $ 20 billion he 's owed . `` How do you calculate for what you do n't know yet ? '' asked Kurtich , who speaks in a deep voice with an accent that 's a mix of Croatian and Cajun . `` Your livelihood could be in jeopardy for one , two , three years or maybe seven or eight . God only knows . '' It 's complicated to figure out how much he should claim from BP . Should he estimate lost income to date ? And how should he factor in what he 'll make when many of the now-closed waterways reopen ? Should he try to figure out what he could potentially lose a year or two from now if his oyster beds are ruined by oil , dispersants or too much fresh water -LRB- which is being pumped into canals to keep the oil away but threatening to upset the delicate mix of salinity needed for oysters -RRB- ? Another tricky factor is the price of oysters : Before the spill , they were averaging $ 25 per 100-pound sack ; now they 're at a high of $ 35 . Any calculation of loss that he and others come up with will need to be proved to BP . But a lot of deals in the oyster business are made through handshakes and long-term agreements . Kurtich keeps his business contacts from the past 40 years in a red address book held together with tape and a rubber band . His wife works at a small table , across from his daughter , who sits at a computer helping to track bookkeeping . It is not a corporate boardroom . He has a small insurance policy for about $ 300 a year that covers his oyster beds , which he says is similar to crop insurance for farmers . He bought it this spring before the spill . The son of a Croatian farmer , Kurtich came in the 1960s to this town of 3,100 named for the sulfur that used to be processed and transported from here . A close-knit community of about 1,500 Croatians lives in the surrounding area of Plaquemines Parish . Some of them are third - and fourth-generation oystermen . Kurtich 's success story has been one of hard work and steady growth : He started at his cousin 's grocery store as a bag boy . On the weekends , he 'd hustle , making $ 15 a day in tips . He eventually bought two businesses from his wife 's uncle : a convenience store and an oyster shucking house . He also began acquiring leases for oyster beds . He made deals with a network of about 40 captains who sold him their oysters , which he 'd then sell to wholesalers .

BP , which has garnered the bulk of public attention and contempt for the spill , has assembled a formidable team of Democrats for its Washington lobbying , legal and public-relations offensive . There is Tony Podesta , who heads one of the District 's leading lobbying firms ; legal adviser Jamie Gorelick , a top Justice Department official in the Clinton administration now at the law firm WilmerHale ; Hilary Rosen , a former recording-industry lobbyist who heads the Washington office of the Brunswick Group , a public-relations consultancy ; and Michael S. Berman of the Duberstein Group , who was a longtime aide to former vice president Walter F. Mondale before becoming a lobbyist . Gorelick , who also served as a member of the 9\\/11 Commission , proved critical in coaching the company during tense negotiations with President Obama over the creation of a $ 20 billion escrow fund for spill damages , according to several sources close to the talks . White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week '' that the administration `` forced '' BP to set up the fund and to intensify its efforts to contain the spill . But BP has not ignored the GOP , which has been a crucial ally on Capitol Hill in tamping down calls from liberal Democrats to permanently ban drilling or lift liability limits for the company . The London-based energy conglomerate recently hired Anne Womack-Kolton , who was a press secretary for former vice president Richard B. Cheney , to head its U.S. public-relations shop . And Brunswick has contracted GOP consultants Alex Castellanos and John Feehery to work on behalf of BP , sources familiar with the arrangements said . With nine investigations of the disaster underway , nearly every day has brought a new public-relations crisis . On Sunday , BP defended embattled chief executive Tony Hayward for taking a day off to watch a yacht race . Emanuel , in his remarks to ABC , criticized Hayward for a `` long line of PR gaffes and mistakes . '' BP executives , including Hayward , have appeared at nearly a dozen congressional hearings within the past month and faced the launch of civil and criminal inquiries by the Justice Department . As the company frantically tries to drill two relief wells to stop the flow , its hired guns are facing BP 's drilling partners in the high-stakes legal battle over who is to blame for the Deepwater Horizon disaster . `` This is just an avalanche that almost nobody could keep up with . It 's very , very challenging , '' said one BP adviser , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . The adviser added that until the well is capped , `` it is very difficult to get ahead of this . '' `` Normally , it 's an event that 's over that you 're trying to address , '' the adviser said . `` But this event is not over . '' Anadarko Petroleum , a Houston-based exploration firm with a 25 percent stake in the Deepwater Horizon well , employs former U.S. senator Don Nickles , the Oklahoma Republican , as its chief external lobbyist , records show . The company , which kept a low profile during the early weeks of the crisis , effectively declared war Friday by calling the tragedy `` preventable and the direct result of BP 's reckless decisions and actions . '' Nickles , who also represents Exxon Mobil , was traveling outside the country and could not be reached late last week . Another key player in the disaster is Transocean , a former U.S. firm now based in Switzerland , which leased the Deepwater rig to BP and ranks as the world 's largest owner of offshore drilling platforms . Last month , the company 's Houston affiliate hired lobbyists Bill Brewster , a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma , and Jack Victory , previously an aide to Tom DeLay , the former House majority leader and Texas Republican . Transocean has also retained crisis lawyers John H. Beisner and Ivan A. Schlager of Skadden Arps to cope with the tide of government inquiries . Representatives declined to comment or did not respond to requests . Engineering giant Halliburton of Houston , which was in charge of cementing the well just before the April 20 explosion , has hired Jeffrey Turner of Patton Boggs to help handle legal and congressional inquiries . Other issues will continue to be handled by the firm 's existing stable of lobbyists and public-relations staff , according to spokeswoman Teresa Wong .

His quest takes him back to ancient times where he finds virtue in an ethical system developed by an Indian emperor called Ashoka in the third century B.C. . In his book To Uphold the World : A Call for a New Global Ethic From Ancient India , Rich shows how in our day of globalization and multicultural tensions we have much to learn from Ashoka s policy of nonviolence and compassion . Here , he argues that the BP oil spill makes the need for a global ethic all the more pressing . Rich is a D.C. attorney who promotes environmental and social standards for international finance . In the aftermath of the BP oil spill what has been left unsaid amidst all the finger pointing is that it is the latest example of a global economy in desperate need of a global ethic . The world economic system is driving a significant number of all living creatures to extinction . It is a world order -- or disorder -- which is increasingly undermining the biological foundations of long-term human civilization . Millions on the Gulf Coast now realize belatedly just how much their economic and social survival is linked to the respect and safeguard of other species and ecosystems . The global order of the past 20 years has prioritized market forces over other social values and created a profoundly unstable , interconnected world . A financial crisis in Greece tanks the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York and China s cheap manufacturing affects the polar ice caps . It is a world not only of increased inequality and environmental deterioration , but , as the global financial crisis shows , one where the viability of whole societies , nations , and democracy itself can be put at risk . A decade ago George Soros warned that market fundamentalism was a greater threat to human society than any totalitarian ideology , noting that the supreme challenge of our time is to establish a set of values that applies to a largely transactional , global society . In the words of Catholic theologian Hans K ng , a global market economy requires a global ethic . And each new environmental crisis forces us to recognize that an ethic of respect for all life is also an ethic for long-term human survival and well-being . As an advocate for environmental and social standards for international finance , I thought of the historical nature of this principle , when in India I came across edicts etched into rock faces and stone pillars by the 3rd Century BC Indian Emperor Ashoka . A warrior who became a Buddhist , Ashoka expressed huge remorse over the suffering he caused in his final war unifying India . His edicts , inscribed over much of South Asia , including most of today s Afghanistan , set forth a secular ethic of compassion and non-violence , religious toleration , establishment of forest and nature reserves , and protection of species . Ashoka established a network of free medical services for humans and animals throughout his empire , as well as social welfare for widows and the indigent . But Ashoka s great ethical leap might not have taken place without the foundations laid by Kautilya , the chief counselor of Ashoka s grandfather . Kautilya wrote history s first treatise on economics , the Arthasastra , literally the science of material wealth , which proclaimed the accumulation of material riches as the chief underpinning of human society . He also recommended amoral realpolitik as an effective political approach and was a master of the practice . Though their reasoning was different , Kautilya and Ashoka both helped the poor and protected forests and animals . Kautilya thought such measures strengthened the long-term stability of the state , while Ashoka acted on ethical principles of non-violence and protection of all life . Kautilya s reasoning was utilitarian and rested on a narrow , pessimistic view of human nature . Nobel economics laureate Amartya Sen has compared Kautilya s view of human motivation to that of many conventional contemporary economists . Ashoka wrote that he had changed his viewpoint and tried to create a civic order which would prompt a similar ethical change among the inhabitants of his empire . His was a more hopeful view of human nature , but he probably also realized the Kautilyan world view could not alone hold together a large , diverse empire of nations . Two millennia later Adam Smith in his Theory of Moral Sentiments concluded that the three values of justice , prudence and beneficence uphold the social and economic order . Justice , he emphasized , is the main pillar that upholds the whole edifice . ... if it is removed , the great , immense fabric of human society ... must in a moment crumble to atoms . Ashoka went farther and recognized that justice , prudence and beneficence extended to all living beings . Like Ashoka , we are living in a Kautilyan age and must find a new global ethic to preserve our civilization . Thinkers from Ashoka to Adam Smith to Amartya Sen , all see that if human society is to survive , economic activity has to be embedded in a framework of common ethical values . We need a global consensus for an ethic to guide national and international economic activity . Some global lenders have set standards to mitigate the social and environmental impact of their projects . This is a small beginning in a universal consensus but not near enough . The need for a universal ethic is crucial . The BP disaster , coming in the wake of the global economic crisis , is yet one more wake up call . How many more are needed ? By Steven E.

The merriment belied the tragic reality of the day 's headline : P&J , the city 's 134-year-old oyster company , had stopped shucking that morning . I was in New Orleans to speak at a culinary conference , and of course we ate well , including a three-hour lunch of pig dishes at Cochon . I had a crabmeat omelet at Galatoire 's , which has issued a public statement about the oil-spill disaster in the gulf : `` Nearly 80 percent of Louisiana 's seafood comes from thousands of miles of coastline west of the Mississippi River , hundreds of miles away from the currently affected areas of the Gulf of Mexico . Galatoire 's has taken steps to support our seafood producers and ensure that the freshest , highest quality fish , shrimp , crawfish and crabs are available without interruption . '' Oysters are conspicuous in their absence from the statement , which you can read at Galatoires.com . As Brett Anderson reported in the Times-Picayune on June 13 , the dwindling supply of local oysters in the wake of the oil spill forced Galatoire 's executive chef Brian Landry to scour the restaurant 's decades of menus , looking for traditional dishes to replace those featuring the local bivalves . Chicken livers en brochette , however , just do n't appeal to me as much as oysters prepared the same way . As food writers , we were already lamenting this latest devastating blow to the vibrant cuisine . At the end of the conference and before the speakers ' dinner , I slipped away in a merciful rain shower with culinary scholar Jessica Harris and Latin chefs Maricel Presilla and Patricia Wilson -LRB- all three PhDs -RRB- to Dickie Brennan 's nearby Bourbon House , renowned for the quality of its oysters . We were reassured that the oysters were all from Area 9 in Plaquemines , west of the Mississippi River . It 's one of two areas that have been reopened temporarily as the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals tests gulf oysters and oyster waters . It was Saturday afternoon , about 5 o'clock . Bourbon House sits squarely on the corner of Iberville and boisterous Bourbon Street , in the heart of the French Quarter . The Beans + Rice conference -LRB- where we had lectured -RRB- , the Creole Tomato Festival and the Louisiana Seafood Festival were going on simultaneously in the Quarter , so there were even more foodies than normal in New Orleans , if that 's imaginable . But Bourbon House was n't half-full -- at happy hour on Saturday -- and several lesser-known oyster bars we passed were empty . I 'm the first to admit that I prefer the brinier East Coast oysters of the R months , if for no other reason than that 's what I grew up with . But , as Presilla noted , the plump , meaty oysters from Plaquemines that we ate on Saturday `` beg to be cooked and sauced . '' We ordered several dozen , both cooked and raw , tossing them back with champagne . -LRB- The best I had were the wood-fired ones at Cochon . -RRB- Wistfully , we snapped cellphone photos of what might well be among the last Gulf Coast oysters for a while . We walked back to the hotel in the rain . I do n't get to the Gulf Coast often , but no food writer can ignore the bountiful cornucopia of the New Orleans table . There 's noplace else in the world quite like the Crescent City , with its Creole and Cajun cultures , its sultry weather , its magnificent architecture , its self-proclaimed decadence . Mardi Gras , Jazz Fest and Friday at Galatoire 's are no more excessive than an ordinary meal in New Orleans . Mounds of beans and rice , sweetbreads , vegetables swimming in hollandaise and oysters Rockefeller are mere side dishes or appetizers . Courses that follow are stuffed with crabmeat , garnished with crawfish and invariably sauced , followed by gumbo , jambalaya or fried soft-shell crabs with sauce Choron . For as long as I can remember , I have eaten oysters , frog 's legs , shrimp , crawfish and drum . That 's because I was born a stone 's throw from the Mississippi , in Baton Rouge . When I was 3 , we moved to the very similar terrain of the South Carolina low country . I have lived through several hurricanes , including Hugo , which put me out of house and business for a year . When I was growing up , my mother would send me out in our sailboat 's dinghy to catch lunch . In autumn , I would cast our old circular shrimp net into the brackish waters of the salt marsh , pulling in several pounds of shrimp . At low tide in winter , I would gather oysters and clams from the then-pristine waters , my mother tossing back into the creek any oysters under 10 inches long . In spring , the crab trap offered up not only those luscious blue crabs , but flounder and eel as well . My older sister Nancy returned to Louisiana to attend LSU . On the rare occasion that she was home , she gloated about her meals at Galatoire 's : turtle soup , shrimp remoulade , crabmeat omelet , crawfish etouffee and , of course , those oysters . Shortly after Nancy went away to school , we began spending a lot of time on our sailboat down on the estuaries behind Hilton Head Island . For years ours was one of a handful of pleasure craft docked or moored there . We envied her restaurant meals in Louisiana , but we had a wealth of seafood a cast or trap away . These days , I drive a car , use air conditioning and leave all sorts of appliances and electronic equipment plugged in , their digital clocks constantly draining electricity and increasing our demand for cheap fuel . No matter what I think about BP , I know that I , too , am partly to blame for the oil spill , because I add to that demand . We are all incensed about the ecological damage to the gulf , but multinational oil companies have spilled many millions of gallons in the Niger Delta over the years , polluting the air , water and soil of millions of Nigerians who depend on fish from the rivers simply to sustain their lives . I can give you a ballpark estimate of how many turtles and dolphins have washed up dead in the oily mess in the gulf , but I can not tell you the name of a single one of the people who lost their lives in the rig fire . I am embarrassed by my own myopia and greed . I am livid about the gulf oil spill , and I worry about the seafood industry , but I also know that many of the thousands of jobs affected by the spill are for manual laborers who will never set foot in the temples of Creole cuisine about which I , with my bourgeois tastes and wallet , tend to wax poetic . I am angry and worried about the people of Louisiana . How much more can they take ? Do I continue to order oysters out of season in hopes of contributing to the demand for them , so that prices will go higher and help the Gulf Coast seafood industry if and when it is able to return to business ? Do I continue to write purplish prose about my favorite seafood dishes while fishermen are out of work ? This tragedy should present us all with moral dilemmas . I think we must demand change , but change begins at home . As President Obama noted in his June 15 speech about the disaster , `` we ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy . '' Boycotting BP will only hurt your local gas station owner . Instead , slow down , use public transportation , and carpool . Set your air conditioning a few degrees higher . Turn off your computer and cellphone when they 're not in use . And this weekend , forgo those bottles of champagne and imported wine and instead write a check to one of the nonprofit groups that are prepared to employ trained volunteers to help clean up the mess and restore the fisheries .

The base-line measures of the crisis have steadily worsened . The estimated flow rate keeps rising . The well is like something deranged , stronger than anyone anticipated . BP executives last month said they had a 60 to 70 percent chance of killing it with mud , but the well spit the mud out and kept blowing . The net effect is that nothing about this well seems crazy anymore . Week by week , the truth of this disaster has drifted toward the stamping ground of the alarmists . The most disturbing of the worst-case scenarios , one that is unsubstantiated but is driving much of the blog discussion , is that the Deepwater Horizon well has been so badly damaged that it has spawned multiple leaks from the seafloor , making containment impossible and a long-term solution much more complicated . Video from a robotic submersible , which is making the rounds online , shows something puffing from the seafloor . Some think it 's oil . Or maybe -- look again -- it 's just the silt blowing in response to the forward motion of the submersible . More trouble : A tropical wave has formed in the Caribbean and could conceivably blow through the gulf . `` We 're going to have to evacuate the gulf states , '' said Matt Simmons , founder of Simmons and Co. , an oil investment firm and , since the April 20 blowout , the unflagging source of end-of-the-world predictions . `` Can you imagine evacuating 20 million people ? ... This story is 80 times worse than I thought . '' The bull market for bad news means that Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the crisis , is asked regularly about damage to the well bore , additional leaks and further failures . `` Can you talk a little about the worst-case scenarios going forward ? '' a reporter asked Tuesday . `` What happens if the relief wells do n't work out ? '' `` We 're mitigating risk on the relief well by drilling a second relief well alongside it , '' responded Allen , possibly the least excitable figure in this entire oil crisis . He said he 's seen no sign of the additional leaks that have gotten so many bloggers in a lather . But Allen 's briefings offer plenty of fodder for the apocalyptic set . Allen repeatedly has acknowledged that there could be significant damage to the well down below the mud line . That 's why , he said , the top kill effort last month was stopped : Officials feared that if they continued pumping heavy mud into the well , they would damage the casing and open new channels for hydrocarbons to leak into the rock formation . `` I think that one thing that nobody knows is the condition of the well bore from below the blowout preventer down to the actual oil field itself , '' Allen said last week . `` We do n't know if the well bore has been compromised or not . '' And by the way , the blowout preventer is leaning , Allen said . `` The entire arrangement has kind of listed a little bit , '' he said . A government spokesman later said this development was n't new . Even the most sober analysts are quick to say that this is such an unpredictable well that almost anything is possible . Bruce Bullock , director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University , said additional leaks are a possible source of deep-sea plumes of oil detected by research vessels . But this part of the gulf is pocked with natural seeps , he noted . Conceivably the drilling of the well , and\\/or the subsequent blowout , could have affected the seeps , he said . `` Once you started disturbing the underground geology , you may have made one of those seeps even worse , '' he said . But Tadeusz Patzek , a professor who is the chairman of the department of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas , argues that the discussion has been hijacked by people who do n't know what they 're talking about . `` There is a lot of fast talk , which has little relation sometimes to reality , '' Patzek said . `` And there is jumping to conclusions by the people who have no right to jump to any conclusions because they do n't know . '' Much of the worst-case-scenario talk has centered on the flow rate of the well . Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- , among the harshest critics of BP in recent weeks , generated headlines with a dramatic announcement Sunday . `` I actually have a document that shows that BP actually believes it could go upwards of 100,000 barrels per day , '' Markey said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' `` So , again , right from the beginning , BP was either lying or grossly incompetent . First they said it was only 1,000 . Then they said it was 5,000 barrels . Now we 're up to 100,000 barrels . '' The 1,000 - and 5,000-barrel figures -LRB- 42,000 gallons and 210,000 gallons -RRB- , however , were estimates of the actual flow ; the 100,000-barrel figure -LRB- 4.2 million gallons -RRB- in the internal BP document was based on a hypothetical situation . The document stated , `` If BOP and wellhead are removed and if we have incorrectly modeled the restrictions -- the rate could be as high as -LCB- tilde -RCB- 100,000 barrels per day . '' The blowout preventer and wellhead have not been removed . Another undated BP document , released by Sen. Charles E. Grassley -LRB- R-Iowa -RRB- last week , has an even more dramatic worst-case scenario for the well 's flow rate , but again one based not on the well as it is but on a theoretical formulation arrived at before the drilling . Under the heading `` Maximum Discharge Calculation , '' the document states that , given the most `` optimistic assumptions '' about the size of the reservoir and the intensity of the pressure at depth and assuming a total loss of well control and no inhibitions on the flow , `` a maximum case discharge of 162,000 barrels per day was estimated . '' After the Deepwater Horizon rig sank , BP recalculated that estimate based on what was known about the well . BP executives in early May briefed members of Congress on their conclusion : that the absolute worst-case flow rate was 60,000 barrels , with a `` more reasonable worst-case scenario '' of 40,000 barrels a day , the document states . Today the official government estimate of the flow , based on multiple techniques that include subsea video and satellite surveys of the oil sick on the surface , is 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day . In effect , what BP considered the worst-case scenario in early May is in late June the bitter reality -- call it the new normal -- of the gulf blowout .

There 's no question that BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil spill is an unmitigated disaster of yet unknown societal and economic proportions , not to mention the possibly irreparable damage to coastal and marine ecosystems . According to government estimates , as of yesterday anywhere from 39 million to 111 million gallons of crude oil has gushed into the Gulf of Mexico -LRB- that excludes captured oil -RRB- . Most officials lean toward the higher totals while noting up to 2.5 million gallons more continue to spill each day -- that 's an Exxon Valdez spill -LRB- nearly 11 million gallons total -RRB- about every four days . Yet , while this oil spill and others before it have dominated the news , according to a 2003 National Research Council -LRB- NRC -RRB- report , at least 375 million gallons of oil end up in the world 's oceans virtually unnoticed every year from natural sources and from human activities associated with the extraction , transportation and use of oil . Should the current rate of uncaptured oil discharged from the BP well continue , the spill will equal the yearly amount of oil entering the world 's oceans sometime in August . Which is just about the time relief wells will , supposedly , completely plug the Deepwater Horizon gusher . Unfortunately , no such end is in sight for the apparently massive background level of oil pollution . Natural seepage generally occurs in regions of concentrated oil -LRB- and gas -RRB- -- not surprisingly , these are often the same areas where oil wells are drilled -- such as the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of California , and accounts for 47 % of oil pollution worldwide . It follows that anthropogenic sources account for the majority -LRB- 53 % -RRB- of yearly oil pollution -LRB- almost 200 million gallons -RRB- of the world 's oceans . Of special interest and relevance to the U.S. , the NRC reports that of the 375 million gallons entering the oceans worldwide every year , at least 75 million originate from North America . The largest component -LRB- 62 % -RRB- is seepage from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico and to a lesser extent the ocean bottom off the California coast . While proportionally less than for the globe , anthropogenic sources are not insubstantial -LRB- 28.5 mil gallons -RRB- , with the vast majority not from accidents in extraction or transport , but human use , including misuse and waste of oil and oil-based products . The vast majority of use-related oil pollution -LRB- about 87 % -RRB- in North America is from urban runoff into rivers , discharges from commercial and recreational marine vessels , and air pollution . Among the individual sources are improper disposal of used motor oil , -LRB- e.g. , from cars , lawn mowers , etc -RRB- , oily storm-water drainage from city streets , runoff of municipal and industrial petroleum waste products -LRB- e.g. , from refineries and power plants -RRB- , leaking from storage facilities , oil released from bilge cleaning and other ship operations , and deposition by rain of atmospheric hydrocarbons . More than half of the oil that originates from land-based sources and ends up in North America 's near-shore waters comes from the urbanized areas between Maine and Virginia . The airborne sources of oil pollution into the ocean nominally include emissions from vehicles , power plants and industrial facilities . Added now to an unknown degree is the hydrocarbon load from purposeful spot burning of surface oil in the Gulf . Speculatively , at least some , if not most of the oil rid from the surface of the Gulf might simply settle back or be washed out by rain and spread as a poisonous residue over a larger area including , possibly , otherwise unaffected regions over land . Individually , each contributor of oil pollution of our seas may be relatively small and sporadic , but collectively amount to tens of thousands of releases into the world 's oceans every year . Notwithstanding the justifiable attention on the Gulf spill and its catastrophic consequences , these sources of oil pollution might very well be more important in both scale and degree to the longer-term health of the marine environment . While many aspects of the chemical composition of these diffuse contaminants are largely unknown , they continuously create relatively low but chronic contamination over huge areas of the world 's oceans . We know that in the short term , even a small amount of oil in the sea can have severe effects on marine life depending on the location and timing of its release . Over the long term , there is possibly a latent -LRB- hidden -RRB- period before evidence of non-obvious consequences of oil pollution are discovered . And then it might be too late to do anything about it -LRB- advocates for climate change action know this feeling all too well -RRB- . On the other hand , except for natural seepage , the of oil now hemorrhaging into the Gulf is unique in that it enters the water from unprecedented depths -LRB- approx . Consequently , many of the contaminants are washed off or dissolved as the oil rises with some unknown percentage of the total forming extensive plumes well below the surface . The concentrated and continuing effects of contaminants reaching beaches , wetlands and , especially , ecosystems and food chains within the Gulf -LRB- and perhaps beyond -RRB- will presumably remain open questions subject to intense research for the foreseeable future . One question I do not have an answer to is what , if any research has been done to date studying the ever-present natural seepage of large volumes of crude oil from the floor of the Gulf . Whatever the outcome of the Gulf disaster , it 's clear that ultimately it will be a matter only of determining the degree and extent of the environmental and human tragedies , and whether lessons learned will be sufficient to avoid comparable catastrophes in the future . POSTSCRIPT : During World War II , 452 oil tankers were sunk in the North Atlantic , as were an unknown number of the 1080 wrecks lying on the bottom of the Pacific . Little is known about the total amount of oil that spilled directly in to the ocean , but it 's likely much went to the bottom in ships that remained virtually intact . It is known that two oil tankers sunk in 1942 lie only a few hundred miles from Australia 's Great Barrier Reef and are estimated to contain as much oil as the Exxon Valdez .

Posted by : oneStarMan | June 24 , 2010 11:13 AM | Report abuse It 's never too late to remove the cause of pollution . The only thing preventing it is a lack of will to do it . BP tried to minimize their catastrophe from the start . Nature will adapt to the oil but it can never adapt to greedy idiots . We must get rid of oil drilling in areas where it does n't belong . We should adopt a decent energy policy to address this . First , implement fuel rationing as we did in WWII . Next , tax everything associated with cars -LRB- purchase , registration , fuel purchases , drivers ' license renewal ... -RRB- and it is vitally important that we apply the proceeds of these new taxes to transportation\\/energy applications -LRB- highway construction and maintenance and relief of Metro and other transit systems ' deficites as well as transit system construction -RRB- . The present Virginia car tax is wrong because proceeds go to the general fund , and not to highway and transit improvements . It should be repealed and replaced with a tax applied to transportation . Motor vehicle fleets -LRB- e.g. taxicabs , emergency and law enforcement -RRB- and vital applications would be exempt from rationing and taxation requirements . Hybrid and electric vehicles would be taxed at a rate lower than standard internal combustion . As long as we adhere to `` business as usual '' we 'll continue to need offshore petroleum drilling with its attendant pollution risks . Same goes for tar sands and other environmentally risky petroleum recovery options . The natural seeps are processed naturally by bacteria . Small amounts of manmade spills can be processed naturally under the right conditions . I believe it needs to warm and bacteria have to be present . When a contractor spilled oil and diesel on a property where I used to live , I was instructed to mix it with dirt , then cover it so the rain did n't leach it out . As for what to do about our need for oil : free up the market . Use the EPA and other agencies to monitor the environment and fine those who pollute . It is obvious that the government agency that approved BP 's emergency plans was just a rubber stamping agency . But the use of the EPA to shut down carbon industries is a back door attempt to get around the do-nothing congress and will be very detrimental to the economy . But that should be thought out , particularly the unintended consequence of discouraging private reserves . If that approach is chosen , then the government still needs to get out of energy economics and simply fund basic research for long term investments in alternatives . Everything else is pure politics and we end up with light rail that nobody uses , biofuels that are completely uneconomic , solar farms in Virginia where the sun shines 2000 out of 8700 hours a year , etc. . On the personal political side , my bus gets 10 % of operating costs from a state subsidy and 80 % of some capital costs from federal . The rest is my roughly $ 300\\/month payment minus $ 115 metro checks . So enjoy your light rail but realize that if I have to pay a lot more -LRB- e.g. diesel tax for my bus -RRB- , I will just drive instead . We have clear cut solutions for cleaning up the Gulf coast spill as it is happening but so far not enough Money and Resources have been deployed to meet the Scale of the Gusher . We -LRB- the USA -RRB- need Four main Tools ; Supertankers , Oil separating Centrifuges , Barges with Pumps , and Sand-Sifting machines . Please Order all major Gulf Coast Oil Drillers -LRB- BP , ExxonMobil , Chevron , Shell , and ConocoPhillips -RRB- to Purchase and Provide these tools , or have the Congress and Gulf Coast Governors Purchase or Lease them and the necessary Manpower and send the bill to BP . Bring In Supertankers that can Suck up Millions of gallons of Oil and Water and discharge it for Separation and processing . Surround the Marshes and Beaches with Barges to serve as Barrier Walls with Suction Pumps and Separators to Suck the Oil off the water and Dispose of it in Refineries along the coast . Use Sand-Sifting machines , which are capable of cleaning long areas of beach in minutes rather than the hours it takes to do the work by hand . Can we all get on board for this effort to Cleanup the current Gusher or is there something better to use or more important ? Right now the Gulf Coast States , BP , ExxonMobil , Chevron , Shell , and ConocoPhillips are not doing these things to the extent that they are needed and both Republicans and Democrats need to initiate Drastic action yesterday if anyone is to be trusted ever again to handle the people s business . I 'm writing my Governor , Congressman and Senators now . Gulf Coast Governors can Buy and Lease the Equipment just as well as anyone and bill all expenses to BP . = = = Okay , that 's global warming , which Fox news is denying , as they keep blaring we should apologize to poor BP for our shakedown of this magnificent company ; ' -RRB- ... And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; . . = = = that 's the Gulf Spill . BTW , oceanographers say we 've already just about killed the ocean . That will only be the final straw . = = = I 'm trying to figure what the second prophecy is for . And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ; = = = Um , some surprise yet to come , I guess . But it 's all true to form . Sounds like a volcano , but none have erupted that near the sea yet . I guess the ash from a v volcano could turn the water red , depending on the mineral content . Or , an asteroid collision . I 'd go with an asteroid collision since I ca n't recall any volcanoes that spewed red ore . If that occurs , it 's any ones ' guess what that means to the oil spill Posted by : SteveT-CapitalWeatherGang | June 24 , 2010 2:04 PM | Report abuse FAUX Breaking News : Oil , Gas and Chemical companies complain that not allowing them to Poison Local Communities and their Water Supplies will force them to curtail hiring .

Cry me a River . That is what I called the Dance of Deliberate Deception . No one will come forward with the intestinal fortitude , and declare the obvious - that crude oil is toxic to breath . There are warnings posted wherever the refined oil is found , like gas stations . I have been told that a medical study can not be conducted until after 6 months of exposure . There have been 21 years since the exposure of the crude oil in Prince William Sound , and no one is listening . So , after 6 months of workers in the gulf breathe in the crude oil , a study can be conducted ? That leads me to believe that the government is holding up the rug , while BP sweeps known reports under the same rug , and the other agencies conduct the Dance of Deliberate Deception on top of the rug . Anyone who reads this alert , stand with me , and demand honest answers for the Gulf residents , and cleanup workers who will be suffering from the crude oil toxic fumes if this political dance continues . This alert has been posted since day one of the Gulf crude oil spill , and I will continue posting until BP supplies beach oil cleanup workers respirators .

Keep up your good work . This is an awesome way to get back at BP ! Words alone do NOT suffice . I could not come up with a better description on the state of affairs ; `` Dance of Deliberate Deception . And , of course , this unfortunately applies to far too many aspects of public affairs across the spectrum of politics and vested economic entities .

But then , two months ago , the leaking BP oil well began pouring crude into the waters where he took families fishing for snapper and amberjack . Two weeks and two days ago , with his fishing grounds closed , Kruse , 55 , took a job working for BP 's cleanup crew . For the very people who 'd caused the mess . Other boat captains said Kruse , like them , found the effort confusing , overly bureaucratic and frustrating . He told them to keep their heads down , not to worry about the hassles . But those close to him saw he was losing weight . On Wednesday morning , Kruse drove to his boat as usual . As the deckhands prepared for the day 's work , Kruse , as the captain , was supposed to turn on the generator . But after a few minutes , the crew members said , they did n't hear anything and went looking for him . A deckhand found him in the wheelhouse , shot in the head . The Baldwin County , Ala. , coroner 's office called his death an apparent suicide and said Kruse did n't leave a note . There 's no way to be sure why he would have taken his life . But his friends see the tragedy as a clear sign of the BP spill 's hidden psychological toll on the Gulf Coast , an awful feeling of helplessness that descends on people used to hard work and independence . `` We 're helping cover up the lie . We 're burying ourselves . We 're helping them cover up the -LRB- expletive -RRB- that 's putting us out of work , '' said a 27-year-old deckhand who was working for Kruse on Wednesday and spoke on condition of anonymity . He said Kruse was facing the same problems as others in his business : `` It 's just setting in with 'em , you know ; reality 's kicking in . And there 's a lot of people that are n't as happy as they used to be . '' Around the gulf , social service providers are dealing with a rising tide of mental health crises . Groups of Baptists are deploying extra chaplains in parishes along the coast . In southern Louisiana , where the impact was felt first , about 1,500 people have received counseling services from Catholic Charities . From past disasters , such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 , health experts say they expect a wave of physical health problems , such as high blood pressure and heart disease . But they also expect more-subtle problems , as people absorb the spill 's impact on their lives : depression , anxiety , alcohol and drug abuse , domestic issues . `` We 're seeing already an increase in suspiciousness , arguing , domestic violence ... We 're already having reports of increased drinking , anxiety , anger and avoidance , '' Howard J. Osofsky of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans said during a two-day hearing this week on the physical and emotional impact of the spill . Michele Many , a social worker who helps fishermen 's wives , said the stress of the spill is compounded by its uncertainty . Oil is still pouring out , spreading , with an unmanageable toxicity that evokes comparisons to disease . `` The oil spill is like a cancer or tumor , '' said Many , who works at Louisiana State University . `` It is creeping and unpredictable from whether people will have livelihoods or health issues later from helping clean it up . You just do n't know whether it is benign or malignant . '' In Lafitte , La. , 200 hundred miles from the marina where Kruse died , Claudia Helmer heard about the suicide Wednesday afternoon .

Engineers scrambled late in the day to recap the well , and the video feed showed a protracted battle to seat the dangling dome on the spewing pipe atop the blowout preventer . Late Wednesday , the company said the cap was successfully reinstalled . But it was unclear when it would return to its previous level of performance . The struggle with the cap provided another reminder , if any was needed , that engineers are trying to control the blown-out well with novel tactics and jury-rigged hardware . Nothing has come easily , and the incremental progress has been vulnerable to swift reversal . The morning mishap with the makeshift cap on the well ended a 24-hour period of relative success . On Tuesday , the cap had managed to capture 16,668 barrels -LRB- 700,056 gallons -RRB- of oil ; 10,429 more barrels -LRB- 438,018 gallons -RRB- were flared through a separate containment operation that continues uninterrupted . The amount was the highest yet contained since the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon . But at 9:45 a.m. Wednesday , workers on the drillship Discoverer Enterprise , which is parked above the well and directly connected to the blowout preventer via the cap and a riser pipe , noticed liquid pouring from a valve inside the ship . A BP spokesman said the company thinks the liquid was seawater . What 's certain is that it was not expected and indicated something had gone awry with a system designed with great delicacy earlier this month . Engineers quickly disengaged the cap and the riser . Scrutiny of the cap indicated that a vent had been inadvertently closed , possibly bumped by one of the many remotely operated vehicles , or ROVs , that conduct the subsea operations , Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen said . Officials spent much of Wednesday studying the cap for signs that it might be clogged with methane hydrates , a slushy substance that forms when cold seawater mixes with gas in the pressurized depths of the sea . The live video feed from the gulf showed a scene not witnessed for weeks : a plume of oil and gas surging from the sheared-off pipe atop the well 's blowout preventer . The overall flow has been estimated by the government at 35,000 to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million to 2.52 million gallons -RRB- a day . Complicating matters in coming days and weeks is that hurricane season is kicking into full gear . A tropical wave in the Caribbean -- not yet a tropical depression or tropical storm -- slowly drifted west . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration gave it a 30 percent chance of strengthening into a tropical cyclone by Friday . The industry rule in the gulf is that all personnel are evacuated in advance of a major storm . Some ships can handle heavy weather , but others will need to find a safe port . There are more than 25 ships and rigs at the disaster site in the gulf . The Q4000 , the semi-submersible rig that is flaring oil and gas , can detach from the blowout preventer and sail away relatively quickly , Allen said , but the Discoverer Enterprise will need six or seven days ' warning ahead of a storm so it can disengage from the well . `` We 're going to have to look at the tracks of these storms , look at the probabilities , and have to act very early on , '' Allen said . `` If you kind of look at the area between the Yucatan Channel , Cuba and the Straits of Florida , that 's kind of a radius or a parameter . Anything approaching that area ... should prompt some action at that point . '' Off the coast of Louisiana , another storm raged Wednesday , this one political and involving the federal government and the state of Louisiana . The state began an ambitious dredging operation this month to create `` sand berms '' to serve as barriers against the encroaching oil on either side of the Mississippi River delta . But federal officials halted the dredging east of the river Tuesday , declaring that the state had failed to live up to an agreement to use sand from deeper water to build the berms . Assistant Interior Secretary Tom Strickland told reporters that the dredges were taking sand from shallow areas , potentially putting fragile stretches of the Chandeleur Islands in jeopardy . `` You do n't want to destroy the village to save the village , '' Strickland said . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- scoffed at the federal protest after touring the dredging operation by helicopter . `` This is a disaster for our state . We can not wait for more conference calls and meetings for discussions . We need to adapt to the situation on the ground and continue our dredging operations for as long as possible until we can move to the next borrow site and continue to create sand boom , '' Jindal said in a statement released by his office . In New Orleans , the Obama administration tried to delay a federal judge 's ruling Tuesday that tossed out the government 's moratorium on deep-water drilling . The government had already announced it would appeal the ruling , which said the moratorium overstepped federal authority . The oil industry had vociferously protested the moratorium , claiming that the Deepwater Horizon disaster did not mean that all drilling at great depths is unsafe . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar testified Wednesday in Washington that he might order a new , but less sweeping , moratorium on operations in water deeper than 500 feet . `` It might be that there are demarcations that can be made based on reservoirs where we actually do know the pressures and the risks associated with that versus those reservoirs that are exploratory in nature , '' Salazar said in an appearance before the Senate Appropriations Committee .

Meteorologists say Tropical Storm Alex , which is brewing in the western Caribbean , is not on pace to hit the oil well , but it has prompted the team overseeing the spill site to heighten emergency planning . If a storm with gale-force winds comes within five days of reaching the gushing oil well , crews would begin packing up to return to shore , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , who is overseeing the crisis for the government . A full evacuation could stop containment activities for two weeks . `` We are watching the storm track , and if we think it is turned in such a way that it would cross the site , we would activate the plans , '' Allen said Saturday on a call with reporters . `` We are engaged constantly with the National Hurricane Center ... We all know that the weather is unpredictable . '' Allen and his team might be forced to make tough and consequential predictions anyway . More than 30,000 people and 6,000 ships are working on the spill , and they will need several days ' warning to get out of a storm 's way . If a storm pops up in the gulf suddenly , people can be evacuated in a tighter time frame , but those contingency plans risk damaging key equipment . `` The safety of life is the number one priority , '' Allen said . BP is working to shorten the time needed to secure or move all of its equipment from five days to two , company spokesman Bill Salvin told the Associated Press . The equipment includes the ships processing the oil sucked up by the containment cap on the well and the rigs drilling the two relief wells . A full evacuation would force BP to disconnect the ships from the containment cap now funneling half or more of the leaking oil to tankers waiting above the well a mile below the surface . Allen said the workers would return to shore , wait out the storm and then reconnect the complicated equipment . BP is working to develop a containment system that would be easier to disconnect and hook back up . The construction of the two relief wells , projected to be done by mid-August , would also be impeded by stormy weather . Those relief wells are the best hope of halting the oil that has been gushing into gulf waters since April 20 in the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . BP is capturing 20,000 to 28,500 barrels -LRB- 840,000 to 1.2 million gallons -RRB- of oil a day . Worst-case government estimates say 59,500 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons -RRB- a day are leaking from the well , although that number is a rough approximation .

One week after BP chief executive Tony Hayward endured a tongue-lashing at a House committee hearing , returned to England and made headlines by going sailing on his yacht , Dudley stepped in to speed up plans for a free-standing BP unit that will be devoted entirely to repairing the Gulf environment . But it will take more than Dudley 's calm demeanor and American accent to clean up BP 's image , which has been blackened by the relentless video of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico , the widening damage to the environment and reams of damning documents about the rig accident that triggered the spill . Even Dudley realizes that . `` We can understand why the nation is angry with BP , '' he told a group of reporters Thursday . He added , `` until we close the well off , I think there 's a period here where its going to be very difficult to restore BP 's reputation . '' For now , Dudley 's task is more concrete . Since the April 20 blowout , hundreds of BP employees have been rushed to the Gulf coast to do everything from consulting on ways to plug the leak to coordinating cleanup . Now BP wants some of them to go back to their regular jobs , while hiring outsiders who might be better suited to running a cleanup operation . Fixing up disasters , Dudley said , `` is not a core competency with us . '' He said that he hoped to bring in James Lee Witt , who was director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Bill Clinton . `` Our intention is to restore the Gulf to the way it was before this happened , '' he said . It is a task that many environmentalists say might not be possible . Dudley will report to Hayward , who will return to running the rest of the company after devoting the past two months to the spill . `` BP is a big organization around the world , and it needs guidance , '' Dudley said . Hayward is supposed to travel soon to Russia , where BP has a large , lucrative joint venture . `` I 'm sure he 'll be back to the U.S. , '' Dudley said . `` I just ca n't tell you when . '' Dudley said that by setting up a dedicated division for the oil spill , BP was making a long-term commitment , not limiting its liabilities . He said all 33 claims offices would remain open and be used by Kenneth Feinberg , administrator of the new $ 20 billion escrow fund set up at the White House 's behest last week . He said he would support changes such as adding blimps to help guide skimming boats to oil sheens in the Gulf and paying business claims a month in advance rather than retrospectively so businesses in the region could function better . He also said that BP had `` reached out '' to the family of a fishing boat captain who committed suicide . Calling it `` shocking '' and `` terribly tragic , '' he said the company would provide financial support . Although BP announced three weeks ago that it intended to set up an oil spill unit , administration officials at the White House meeting last Wednesday asked that the plan be put into effect immediately , Dudley said . He will be a key link between BP and the administration . In a meeting Thursday , Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson told Dudley that she wanted additional tests near the spill site .

They arrived after the fall of Saigon in 1975 , lured by the city 's tropical climate and strong Catholic heritage . Shrimping and fishing in the Gulf Coast 's bountiful bayous was one of the few familiar touchstones for these mostly unskilled laborers with little English . An estimated 20,000 Vietnamese fishermen and shrimpers live along the Gulf Coast -- about half of the total fishing community -- and many more work at the seafood processing plants , wholesalers and po-boy shops found at every traffic light . Now the sanctuary they found and the lives they built -- and rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina -- are threatened by the hemorrhaging oil in the Gulf of Mexico . Many Vietnamese worry they will not have the energy to start over yet again . `` When I came to Louisiana , this was how people here made a living . I had to follow , '' 50-year-old shrimper Dung Nguyen says in Vietnamese . `` I do n't know how I 'm going to live . '' Nguyen says he has no idea whether life is harder for him than for American shrimpers ; he does n't know any to ask . All he knows is that his wife , their five daughters , his mother-in-law and his granddaughter -- all of whom live with him in a modest rented home in the industrial eastern edge of New Orleans -- are counting on him for survival . That 's why he got up before dawn last week to stand in line for a food voucher with dozens of other out-of-work Vietnamese fishermen and shrimpers in the concrete alley in front of Mary Queen of Vietnam Catholic Church 's community office . The wait can last five , six , even seven hours . Oversleepers are turned away before they even make it inside . `` If you 're a little bit late ... , '' Nguyen warns in Vietnamese , shaking his head . He knows because he showed up after 5 a.m. for two days and missed out on a $ 100 grocery store gift certificate , 20 of which are handed out every morning . It is 8:30 a.m. and the office has yet to open , but he is hoping the third time is the charm . Besides , he says , he has nothing to do all day but sit around and think -- about having no work , no money and no options . Normally Nguyen is on a boat this time of year , coming ashore for a home visit about once a month . His wife , Ut , makes shrimp nets , and his oldest daughter , Lisa , 20 , fixes trawls and cleans boats . Now they are all unemployed . `` Get in a straight line , please , '' a woman calls out in English to the group , mostly men , milling about the alley as staffers open the office door . The Vietnamese quickly flatten themselves along the wall as aid workers hand out numbered tickets for vouchers to the first in line . Dung secures one , as does his wife , even though the vouchers are technically limited to one per family . Because so many Vietnamese share the same last name and the community is so intertwined , the rule is tough to enforce .

That 's a fair question , '' said Steve Benz , MSRC president and a former BP executive . He stressed that the U.S. Coast Guard set benchmarks for how much equipment and manpower large oil-recovery companies should have . Also , he said , any standing operation would have difficulty immediately capturing the volume of oil gushing from the Gulf well . `` If this happened again , should we already have in place 20,000 people and 1,000 boats ? '' `` You ca n't build a firehouse that big and have it make any reasonable economic sense . You need to prevent the fire in the first place . '' Congress has been here before . Twenty years ago , after the Exxon Valdez dumped millions of gallons of oil into Prince William Sound , lawmakers angrily reacted -- much as they have today -- by vowing to ensure that such devastation would never happen again . Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , requiring companies transporting oil over water to have ready access to clean-up equipment adequate for the worst possible spill . Big oil companies banded together to form MSRC . Far from the coast , the nonprofit is run out of nondescript offices in Herndon , Va. , sharing a building with a credit union and a title company . The company , which calls itself the nation 's largest oil spill recovery organization , remained low-profile while growing to more than $ 100 million in assets . Its resources include 400 employees and 15 large oil-recovery ships dubbed `` Big Blues '' and positioned in the lower 48 states and Hawaii . It and its contractors have responded to 700 spills , none approaching the magnitude of the Deepwater Horizon blowout . State and regional officials familiar with MSRC 's past work say it does a good job handling more contained environmental challenges . But now MSRC finds itself leading the charge in a much different battle . `` There is no asset MSRC has that is designed to collect oil 5,000 feet under the seas , '' said Brett G. Drewry , chief executive of the industry-backed organization that funds MSRC . That fact did not stop BP and other companies from citing MSRC , alone or alongside for-profit cleanup companies , as their first responder for massive spills . Oil companies , Congress and regulators point to MSRC as evidence of lessons learned from Valdez . Suckling said safeguarding the coasts should not be left to private industry . `` It seems to me there is a real significant conflict of interest here , '' he said . `` When you are dealing with an issue that has such enormous stakes for public health and safety , it should be in the government 's hands .

'' But BP North America -- the energy giant 's U.S. subsidiary -- has donated at least $ 4.8 million in corporate contributions in the past seven years to political groups , partisan organizations and campaigns engaged in federal and state elections , an analysis of campaign and tax records shows . Its most generous corporate contributions -- totaling about $ 4 million -- have gone to two Republican-aligned political action groups working to defeat state ballot initiatives in California and Colorado that could have raised oil and gas industry taxes , according to an analysis of state campaign reports by the Center for Political Accountability . On the national scene , BP spent about $ 112,000 in corporate money to boost the coffers of Democratic and Republican party organizations seeking to elect candidates to higher office , primarily the Democratic Governors Association and the Republican State Leadership Committee . When asked about its political spending , the energy giant said there is no conflict between its ban on political contributions and its donations to political groups . A BP spokesman said its policy bans contributions only to individual candidates in state and federal races , and does not apply to contributions to political advocacy groups registered with the Internal Revenue Service , political party organizations that give money to individual candidates , arms of political parties or larger political campaigns . `` The types of spending that we reported here fits within our policy , '' said BP spokesman Scott Dean . `` Our policy on not making corporate political contributions relates to candidates for political office at the state and federal level . '' BP 's Dean said donations for ballot groups are to help educate the public about policies . He said the donations to partisan Republican and Democratic operations are for the groups ' education funds , and are not intended for partisan political electioneering . `` The California and Colorado ballot initiatives referred to are to support information campaigns concerning legislation or tax initiatives targeting our industry . This money did not go to a political party or candidate , so it is consistent with our guidelines , '' Dean said . `` As to the Republican and Democratic governors associations ... these contributions are to the educational arms so the money does not support political activity either at the state or federal level . '' Bruce Freed , executive director of the Center for Political Accountability , said the difference between the broad statement and the contributions suggests BP management is not being publicly transparent . He compared it to BP 's conduct in managing the geyserlike oil spill at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which has called into question the company 's pronouncements about its commitment to safety . `` They both raise real questions about BP management and how they run things , '' Freed said . `` They said they were very thorough on safety , and it turns out they were n't . They said they were n't giving political contributions and it turns out they were ... It seems like this is part of the culture of BP . '' Meredith McGehee , a campaign finance expert at the watchdog Campaign Legal Center , said BP may have aimed for a good corporate image , and assumed that its broad statement would not be carefully examined . She said corporations often steer corporate money into state and local political organizations or to tax-exempt 527 political advocacy groups , where there is less disclosure and less press scrutiny . `` Anyone who believes these large corporations are n't deeply involved in political decisions at every level of government is kidding themselves , '' McGehee said . BP gave $ 75 , 000 to the Democratic Governors Association over the past two election cycles and $ 15,000 to the Republican State Leadership Committee . The Democratic Governors Association describes itself as `` a political organization ... dedicated to electing Democratic governors and candidates . '' The Republican State Leadership Committee 's reports that its purpose is to `` raise money for state political activity and organize meetings of state leaders and officeholders to promote Republican candidates and Republican issues .

But will all the spilled oil lead to significant economic losses on a national level ? We do n't think so . After extensive research into the economic consequences of the spill , and crunching industry data as well as figures from several state and federal agencies , we estimate the disaster will lower U.S. economic growth in 2010 by roughly 0.1 percent -- and will dampen growth in the four states most affected -LRB- Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida -RRB- by 1.6 percent of their combined gross domestic product . In dollar terms , we see the oil spill leading to a net loss of just under $ 20 billion for the U.S. economy in 2010 . This is a big hit , to be sure , but it 's not a severe enough external shock to tip the United States into a double-dip recession . Even factoring out the losses to BP , which are large but wo n't weigh directly on U.S. gross domestic product , the oil industry seems likely to suffer the most from the spill . Interestingly , the two factors most commonly cited -- the oil lost into the ocean and President Obama 's now-sidelined moratorium on new deepwater drilling projects -- do n't account for the bulk of the damage . Our analysis shows increased expenses from regulation of deepwater drilling and insurance costing the industry roughly $ 6.5 billion ; it would mean $ 2.3 billion in collateral losses for oil and gas support industries . By contrast , the costs of the moratorium should be less than $ 200 million in 2010 , even if it continues for six months as originally planned . And even using the most extreme estimates on the size of the spill , the cost of the crude lost in the ocean will be well under $ 1 billion , assuming oil prices stay near current levels . Nor do we see the spill creating a supply shock that significantly affects the price of oil . The U.S. oil market is well supplied , with inventories above their five-year averages , and consumption remains subdued . Shipping lanes do not seem to have been affected much , and the United States could always tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a pinch . The Gulf of Mexico produces only 1.7 percent of the world 's petroleum , and most of this production is continuing as scheduled . After the energy industry , we estimate the biggest losses will be suffered by tourism : $ 8.4 billion regionwide , with Louisiana and Florida taking the biggest losses . Particularly in Florida , many of these losses wo n't necessarily result from actual pollution but , rather , from fearful tourists canceling trips . The insurance industry has dodged a bullet . BP is self-insured and thus will cover most cleanup costs . Many of the coastal wetlands degraded by the spill were not insured for environmental damage . Still , using data from Moody 's , we estimate that the insurance industry will lose $ 2.5 billion , given payouts to affected companies and private property owners . Although fishing has received a great deal of media coverage , and losses will be painful for some local economies , we project the industry 's losses at $ 1.2 billion , well below those of oil and tourism . The long-term impact of the spill could be more profound for the environment , specific industries and the overall economy . It 's possible the spill could hasten a shift toward energy companies forgoing insurance -- and planning to eat the costs in the event of spills . This could spell losses for the insurance industry and could create risks that a company wo n't be able to cover its losses and will file for bankruptcy in the wake of a future spill . Another possibility is that the spill will change the calculus of countries considering offshore oil drilling projects , thereby suppressing global output in the long run . The chances of this are low , however , given the economic imperatives facing many of these countries ' governments , particularly in emerging markets . Finally , the Obama administration seems inclined to use the spill to rally support for a `` clean energy '' bill , which has been stalled in the Senate . Yet even if this effort succeeds , the legislation most likely to be pushed through does n't have much in the way of teeth , meaning it wo n't radically alter U.S. oil consumption and thus wo n't represent a direct swipe at U.S. oil and gas interests .

'' Since the 1970s , when the Chesapeake 's famous oyster harvest was starting to decline , Kellum has been supplementing the local crop with oysters trucked in from the gulf . Others did the same : Today , the bay 's oyster-packing industry relies heavily on imported bivalves . Now , a second great body of water has gone south on them . Kellum seafood is a case study : The oil spill has cut off most of its oyster supply , creating a little pocket of Gulf Coast desperation on the Rappahannock River . Without enough work , the plant 's 32 shuckers have pinned their hopes on a long-distance request that BP replace their lost income . `` I guess it had to come to an end sometime , '' said Alfred Tiggle , 67 , who was hired full time in 1974 . `` I never thought oil could stop it , '' said Yerby , who began in 1952 .

The pine tree product was one of about 120,000 ideas BP says it has received in recent weeks . Its proponent is one of many to express frustration by the company 's apparent lack of response . John Rexholm , a 57-year-old Swedish naval architect living in Germany , has an idea for hooding the blown-out Gulf well and directing the oil up to the surface . He sent it to BP . A month later , he got three e-mail replies in a day : One asked for more information , another said a similar idea was being considered and a third advised that `` your idea can not be applied under the very challenging ... conditions we face . '' Donald LaFond , a 48-year-old contractor in Sudbury , Ontario , is sure that the device he invented eight years ago to crack rock without dynamite could seal the Deepwater Horizon well . He 's spent six weeks trying to get someone to listen . Dwayne Spradlin , head of the Internet-based problem-solving network InnoCentive , put out a call for ideas April 30 . About 2,500 people have answered . On June 19 , BP said it would not proceed with any of their suggestions because an agreement with InnoCentive would be `` too complex and burdensome . '' `` Our network is incredibly disenchanted in BP 's lack of interest in outside solutions , '' Spradlin said . That pretty much summarizes the view of thousands of other people . Thanks to the crowd-sourcing potential of the Internet , sea-floor-to-Gulf-shore video and the water-torture failure of BP to stop the leak , the Deepwater Horizon disaster has become a personal challenge to numberless scientists , engineers and basement inventors . As of Friday , 119,611 technological suggestions had been sent or routed to BP 's offices in Houston , coming in at a rate of about 4,000 a day . The Coast Guard 's Research and Development Center had gotten about 3,000 submittals . Most from both sources proposed ways to stop the leak or clean up the oil .

They include digital photos of drawings on whiteboards and a crayoned idea from a 9-year-old boy in Virginia . `` The passion is just extraordinary , '' said Michael J.

To calculate the incalculable : how much it will cost to restore the gulf to its pre-spill state . But this close collaboration between federal and state authorities and BP -- which is routine procedure under a legal process known as the Natural Resource Damage Assessment -LRB- NRDA -RRB- -- has begun to spark concerns among lawmakers and some environmentalists . `` I want this to be independent , for the credibility of the information , '' said Sen. Ben Cardin -LRB- D-Md . -RRB- , who as chair of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife will hold hearings this month on the issue . The collaborative approach , established under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act , marks a sharp departure from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill , where the federal government kept the oil company at arm 's length . Exxon hired its own boats and experts , who followed state and federal officials at a distance , replicating the tests they believed were being done so they could provide a rival analysis . Stan Senner , who served as Alaska 's restoration program manager after the Valdez spill and now directs conservation science for the Ocean Conservancy , said the current collaboration will likely stop as soon as federal and state officials push for a comprehensive overview of how the accident transformed the gulf . `` I would predict in the end that the relationship will break down , and the government and BP will go their separate ways , '' Senner said , adding that oil companies tend to focus on a spill 's short-term impact . For the moment , though , BP 's representatives weigh in on decision-making in every key aspect , from shoreline surveys to designing scientific studies . BP spokeswoman Anne Kolton wrote in an e-mail that the company is working with state and federal officials `` conducting joint sampling to gather information about the condition of the environment before the spill and to establish the environmental impacts of the spill and extent of restoration that is required . '' In most cases , BP is represented by employees of Entrix , an environmental consulting firm it contacted within hours of the Deepwater Horizon explosion . Entrix is one of two major U.S. consulting firms that specialize in assessing an oil spill 's impact . BP provides the boats used to conduct surveys and even the snacks consumed on board ; it funds the scientific studies that have been launched by government agencies ; and eventually , the company will have to pay for the time of every government official and contractor involved . At the moment , roughly 100 Entrix employees are working alongside more than 250 officials and contractors from state and federal agencies . To some extent , including BP in the process represents a pragmatic calculation : Federal officials say it helps ensure that the oil company will pay for both the evaluation and the massive task of restoring the region to health . NRDA 's goal is to get the responsible party to pay for restoration , and that 's more likely to happen if BP officials agree on the extent of the environmental harm the government says the company has wrought . `` If they pay the bills , they 're welcome at the table , '' said Peter Tuttle , an environmental contaminant specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who is coordinating NRDA activities among Interior Department bureaus . `` They do have a role , they do have a place . '' Tony Penn , deputy chief of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's assessment and restoration division , emphasized that this collaboration does not mean the oil company is steering the investigation . `` That does n't give BP or Entrix the right to shape the course of our assessment or the decisions that are ultimately the government 's responsibility , '' Penn said in an interview . The unprecedented assessment seeks to answer questions that will ultimately determine how much BP pays for restoration : How degraded were the region 's marshes before the oil hit ? Which species of birds and marine mammals were thriving before the accident , and which were struggling ? How are they doing now , and how will they fare decades from now ? The fact that oil has continued to spew from the well for 21\\/2 months only complicates the task . Only one answer is certain : The scientific investigation will take years to complete . `` I do n't think we will fully understand the impact of the spill for decades , '' Tuttle said , adding that state and federal authorities will have to make their `` best guess '' about the extent of damage to reach a fair settlement with BP . `` We 're really motivated to get restoration going as soon as possible . There is an incentive to work toward settlement here -- certainly litigation is n't in anyone 's best interest . '' Dozens of teams are fanning out across the gulf , surveying beaches , sampling everything from water to sediment to tissues from mussels and fish . Each group includes at least one federal official , one state official and one representative from Entrix . For the most part , the collaboration is working smoothly : In late May , Barry Stuedemann , an Entrix senior consultant and wetlands specialist , and one of his colleagues , Winston Rutherford , set out on an air boat off Grand Isle , La. , with officials from NOAA , Fish and Wildlife and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources to survey the marshes . The team stopped at regular intervals to examine everything from what sort of oil was floating in the water to how many birds were flying overhead and whether small snails were thriving on vegetation . At every stop , each team representative signed off on the data entered on the official assessment sheet so no one could contest it later . `` Eventually you 're building up a line of evidence , '' explained Troy Baker , regional resource coordinator at NOAA 's assessment and restoration division in Baton Rouge , adding that if they later revisit the area and find `` you have a lot of dead birds and have a lot of stranded marine mammals , you 're starting to build a picture of the overall threat . '' Sherry Krest , a Fish and Wildlife environmental contaminant specialist based in Annapolis who joined in the Grand Isle expedition , said `` there 's an art and a science '' to conducting an NDRA , and that `` the negotiation is more of an art . '' In the end , Cardin said , he will be watching to make sure the Obama administration does n't make too many concessions for the sake of getting a speedy financial settlement . `` The challenge is whether the federal agencies are up to evaluating the environmental damage , '' he said , `` and whether we will have to patience to see this through , and get the full results before we close the books on this .

The BP oil spill that began with the April 20th Deepwater Horizon explosion is now estimated to be the largest oil spill in history . Multiple story lines have evolved from this disaster , and each provides an opportunity for leaders to succeed or fail in remarkable ways . To follow are five ongoing themes from the disaster that have the potential to offer lasting lessons on leading through crises From the beginning , BP CEO Tony Hayward has seemed to bungle his way through the crisis . From the minimal early estimates of the amount of crude gushing into the Gulf of Mexico to his perplexing attendance at a yacht race and subsequent cancellation of a speaking appearance at an oil conference , Hayward has been consistently inconsistent . While the BP Board offered the embattled CEO public support , his role as the public face of BP has already been diminished , and there 's speculation that the CEO will be terminated after the well has been capped . Can any leader rebound from the sheer number of gaffes following a disaster of this magnitude ? Nearly two months after the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon , President Obama addressed the nation . Obama was his usual calm , cool , and collected self , but pundits on the right suggested that Obama had n't talked with the executives at BP soon enough . Those on the left suggested he missed the opportunity to call for substantive carbon cap legislation . However , Obama was quick to acknowledge that he failed to reform the Mineral Management Services with sufficient urgency , and he also convinced BP to create a 20 billion dollar fund for Gulf Coast residents who have been impacted by the spill . Obama 's legacy will be shaped , in part , by his handling of this disaster , but how will that narrative evolve ? Leader -LRB- s -RRB- of Clean-up Efforts While it 's certain that there will be a significant environmental impact to the Gulf Coast , the extent of the damage is still unknown . The Niger Delta may be the closest example of what happens to an area after repeated oil spills , but the size and scope of this spill , combined with the depth of the gusher , have never been encountered . Early efforts were quick to rely upon releasing oil dispersants into the gulf , but they may have their own unintended environmental impact . While BP continues to tout their clean-up efforts , some suggest they are more for show . This presents a huge opportunity for smaller players to emerge . For example , Kevin Costner has invested in a project that has created a centrifuge that separates oil from seawater , and three of his machines are presently being used and 32 more have been ordered by BP . Who else will emerge as a leader , and who will galvanize Gulf Coast residents with their clean-up efforts ? While not directly related to the BP oil spill , emerging energy companies have been offered a window to introduce their products to a public that may be fairly receptive to new energy ideas . For example , Ginkgo BioWorks has engineered E. coli bacteria so that it converts carbon into transportation fuels . And Bill Gates has funded TerraPower , a company that uses depleted uranium -LRB- previously viewed as nuclear waste -RRB- to create clean energy . Will emerging leaders in private industry like Gingko BioWorks and TerraPower be able to create momentum with their products and reduce our dependence on oil ? Many of us may have ties to the Gulf Coast , but unless you are a resident , it is difficult to imagine the sheer magnitude of this disaster . Yet the constant coverage of the oil spill has the potential to push the disaster to the background while more novel stories slowly grab the spotlight . After all , that 's the nature of modern media . Some have already issued a call to arms . But the larger question remains : will we learn and apply lessons from this disaster , continue to focus attention on clean up efforts , and help reduce the odds that a future event like this occurs ? This disaster will have widespread implications for years . It has already hurt the fishing , tourism and oil industry in the Gulf Coast , and other supporting businesses . In the long term , it has the potential to impact oil consumption habits and shape future drilling policy . But the above are the major themes we 've been following .

Maybe it is time to seek further assurances that the sea food is truly safe to eat , the air is truly safe to breathe and that the rains which are falling , supposedly to nourish the land , are not toxic at all . Assurances too that BP will pay your claims !! ... . . And yes Virginia , there really is a Santa Claus . A final word Mr. President : Are you feeding seafood from the Gulf of Mexico to your children ? Are you going to send them down to the Gulf for a vacation , to play on the sand and breathe in the air ? Will they go swimming in the warm waters also ?

It is perhaps the most important question of the BP oil spill -- but scientists do n't appear close to answering it despite a historically vast effort . In the 21\\/2 months since the spill began , the gulf has been examined by an armada of researchers -- from federal agencies , universities and nonprofit groups . They have brought back vivid snapshots of a sea under stress : sharks and other deep-water fish suddenly appearing near shore , oil-soaked marshes turning deathly brown , clouds of oil swirling in deep water . But , with key gaps remaining in their data , there is wide disagreement about the big picture . Some researchers have concluded that the gulf is being spared an ecological disaster . Others think ecosystems that were already in trouble before the spill are now being pushed toward a brink . `` The distribution of the oil , it 's bigger and uglier than we had hoped , '' said Roger Helm , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official and the lead scientist studying the spill for the Interior Department . `` The possibility of having significant changes in the food chain , over some period of time , is very real . The possibility of marshes disappearing ... is very real . '' Helm said that his prognosis for the spill had worsened in the past week -- as the amount of oily shoreline increased from Louisiana to Florida , despite cleanup efforts . `` This just outstrips everybody 's capability '' to clean it up , he said . This research has mainly occurred in the background , as public attention has focused on the `` open-heart surgery '' at BP 's leaking wellhead . The patient is a 600,000-square-mile sea , which contains swirling currents , sun-baked salt marshes and dark , cold canyons patrolled by sperm whales . Complicating matters is that even before the spill began in late April , the patient was already sick . In recent years , Louisiana has been losing a football field 's worth of its fertile marshes to erosion every 38 minutes . In the gulf itself , pollutants coming from the Mississippi 's vast watershed helped feed a low-oxygen `` dead zone '' bigger than the entire Chesapeake Bay . Measuring the spill 's damage , then , requires distinguishing it from the damage done by these other man-made problems . So far , even the simplest-sounding attempts to measure the spill 's impact have turned out to be complex . The official toll of dead birds is about 1,200 , a fraction of the 35,000 discovered after the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 . But this , too , has been called into question . Officials can only count the birds they can find , and many think a number of oily birds have sought refuge in the marshes . `` It 's an instinctive response : They 're hiding from predators while they recover , '' said Kerry St. P , head of a government program that oversees Louisiana 's Barataria Bay marshes . `` They plan to recover , of course , and they do n't . They just die . '' News , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

Holder Jr. 's statement that Justice Department lawyers examining the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico were looking into possible violations of civil and criminal statutes . Holder made the remark June 1 , not June 2 . BP has steady sales at Defense Department despite U.S. scrutiny The Defense Department has kept up its immense purchases of aviation fuel and other petroleum products from BP even as the oil company comes under scrutiny for potential violations of federal and state laws related to Gulf of Mexico well explosion , according to U.S. and company officials . President Obama said last month that the company 's `` recklessness '' in the gulf contributed to the disaster , and he promised that BP will `` pay for the damage . '' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on June 2 that Justice Department lawyers were looking into possible violations of civil and criminal statutes . `` If we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be forceful in our response , '' he said . BP , meanwhile , remains a heavy supplier of military fuel under contracts worth at least $ 980 million in the current fiscal year , according to the Defense Logistics Agency . In fiscal 2009 , BP was the Pentagon 's largest single supplier of fuel , providing 11.7 percent of the total purchased , and in 2010 , its contracts amount to roughly the same percentage , according to DLA spokeswoman Mimi Schirmacher . `` BP is an active participant in multiple ongoing Defense Logistics Agency acquisition programs , '' Schirmacher said , without providing details . BP spokesman Robert Wine said he was aware of at least one `` big contract '' signed by the U.S. military after the oil rig explosion on April 20 , involving the supply of multiple fuels for its operations in Europe . So far , members of Congress have discussed barring BP from any new oil and gas drilling leases , not from fuel sales to the government . Rep. George Miller -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- , who co-chairs the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee , said last week that he would introduce legislation to shut BP out of such leases for the next seven years , as punishment for what he described as `` serial '' legal violations . But Rep. Bart Stupak -LRB- D-Mich . -RRB- , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's subcommittee on oversight and investigations , said in a statement that `` the U.S. government needs to look at all possible options when it comes to showing BP , or any corporate bad actor , that a continued culture of cost cutting and increased risk taking will absolutely not be tolerated . '' Even before the gulf debacle , the Environmental Protection Agency had begun to explore cutting off BP from all federal contracts -- including those with the Defense Energy Support Center -LRB- DESC -RRB- , which buys all fuel for the military services . The EPA plays the lead role in debarment proceedings related to the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act , and its probe was sparked by BP 's 2006 oil spill in Alaska and a 2005 explosion at a refinery in Texas . The EPA 's deliberations , however , are suspended until the gulf spill investigations conclude , according to an EPA spokeswoman . The agency may decide to shut off federal contracts with specific divisions within BP , or with the whole company `` if it is in the public interest to do so , '' it said in May . Any such action would be meant to punish `` environmental noncompliance or other misconduct , '' it said . Jeanne Pascal , a former EPA lawyer who until recently oversaw the review of BP 's possible debarment , has said she initially supported taking such action but held off after an official at the Defense Department warned her that the Pentagon depended heavily on BP fuel for its operations in the Middle East . `` My contact at DESC , another attorney , told me that BP was supplying approximately 80 percent of the fuel being used to move U.S. forces '' in the region , Pascal said . She added that `` BP was very fortunate in that there is an exception when the U.S. is involved in a military action or a war . '' Pascal then sought a settlement to allow contracting with BP while forcing the company to elevate an internal office dealing with health , safety and environmental issues within its corporate structure . She also demanded that the company keep an ombudsman , retired federal judge Stanley Sporkin , whom BP first hired after the Alaska spill but had sought to let go . BP resisted both demands , and the talks were stalemated when the Deepwater Horizon rig sank , Pascal said . `` At some point , debarment attorneys throughout the government need to look at BP 's record , '' she said . `` This is one of the wealthiest corporations in the world ... Do we want to do business with this foreign corporation , which has a horrendous record of chronically violating U.S. law ? You have to look at the overall behavior pattern . '' A spokeswoman for the Defense Department , Wendy L. Snyder , gave a different account of the internal debarment discussions . She said the Defense Logistics Agency `` informed the EPA that there are adequate procedures and processes to protect the U.S. military missions should EPA determine that BP should be debarred . '' That claim was reinforced by Schirmacher , who said that `` none of BP 's current energy contracts are in direct support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan '' and that the department could meet its requirements without BP fuel . But she indicated that the Pentagon had no intention of taking such action in the absence of an EPA decision . Wine , the BP spokesman , said that although he is not familiar with details of the company 's negotiations with EPA , Sporkin 's tenure was extended earlier this year until the middle of 2011 . He did not challenge Pascal 's claim that BP 's health , safety and environmental unit had been moved lower on the corporate structure before the gulf spill , reporting to the head of a business unit instead of directly to the top executive . But , Wine said , `` what difference does that make ? '' `` Safety comes through the organization through every root , '' he said , and remains `` paramount in every part of the business . '' Several federal agencies have continuing contracts with BP , although none worth as much as the Pentagon 's . Since 2008 , the Federal Aviation Administration has contracted to spend at least $ 2.26 million to station weather , communications and aerial surveillance devices on several BP platforms in the gulf , including the Atlantis oil production platform roughly 100 miles from Deepwater Horizon 's former location . Critics , including a former BP contractor , have alleged that the Atlantis was built without proper safety controls , which BP denies . FAA spokeswoman Laura J. Brown said that BP 's environmental and legal record was not a consideration in her agency 's contracts . The Atlantis platform was selected `` based purely on how it would support air traffic , '' she said .

But the presence of tar balls and oil sheen so close to the Big Easy is a psychological blow . `` This proves that the oil can come in , '' said John Lopez , director of coastal sustainability for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation . `` It 's kind of , on an emotional level , disconcerting to see this happen . '' High seas and strong winds over the weekend pushed the oil into the 630-square-mile lake that borders the city and its major suburbs and is primarily used for recreation . Much of the oil gushing from the Deepwater Horizon explosion more than two months ago has washed ashore near small Gulf Coast towns that are at least a two-hour drive from New Orleans . But Lopez said he had long predicted that the leaking crude could make its way into the lake , especially after Tropical Storm Alex churned through the region last week . On Friday , one of Lopez 's assistants spotted tar balls along Cat Island , off the coast of Mississippi . By Sunday , evidence of the oil had traveled west , to a narrow waterway known as the Rigolets that feeds into Lake Pontchartrain . By Monday , tar balls were washing up near the Treasure Isle community in suburban Slidell , on the eastern edge of the lake . Lopez said he notified authorities , who had also spotted the oil . He estimated the amount at less than 100 barrels -LRB- 4,200 gallons -RRB- and said it was possible that the oil could move farther into the lake . In fact , he said , the direction of the wind could push it right up to the small beach near the University of New Orleans , where his office is located . He has tasked a staffer to begin walking the beach daily in search of tar balls . Because the oil found thus far was a relatively small amount and highly weathered , Lopez said he did not expect it would cause much damage to the lake environment . But he said he was most concerned about the impact on the blue crabs , shrimp and fish that live in the lake when they are not in the Gulf . His group is seeking $ 7 million to fund a five-year impact study . `` It 's a co-dependency , '' he said . The wind was causing problems well out to sea as well . The area around the leaking wellhead , nearly 50 miles off the Louisiana coast , was buffeted Tuesday by strong , 20-knot winds and resulting waves that topped five feet high Tuesday . Those conditions were too rough for most of the `` skimmer '' boats assigned to the gulf , said Thad W. Allen , who has retired as a Coast Guard admiral but has stayed on as the national incident commander for the spill . In addition , Allen said , the waves were delaying efforts to hook up a third siphon from the leaking well to a ship on the surface . A ship called the Helix Producer has arrived at the site , with the capacity to increase the roughly 25,000 barrels a day -LRB- 1.1 million gallons -RRB- being siphoned from the well to more than 53,000 barrels -LRB- 2.2 million gallons -RRB- . But connecting it to the siphon requires workers to descend to a platform just above the water 's surface ; if the waves are too high , the platform might be dangerously unsteady . A National Weather Service forecast said waves are expected to remain this high until at least Thursday . Allen spoke from BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston , where he was meeting with the oil company 's leaders about what may be the next step to contain the leaking well . That would entail removing the current containment cap , which fits over a stub of pipe leading out of the well 's blowout preventer on the seafloor . This cap leaks on purpose : If oil does n't seep out , officials fear that seawater will leak in and create slush-like `` hydrates '' that will gum up the system . Allen said the next step is to replace that cap with a tighter-fitting one that would allow no oil to escape . But the process could take seven to 10 days , he said , during which oil would leak from the pipe stub . Now , he said , officials will debate when -- and whether -- to do it . He said that if the Helix Producer brings up enough oil , it may not be necessary to replace the cap . `` The question is , do we want to wait and look at the product '' that comes up after the Helix Producer is connected ? In addition , Allen said that tar balls found along the Texas coast this week did not appear very weathered , making it unlikely that they had floated from the leaking well . Instead , he said , officials believe that they may have been accidentally carried to Texas by vessels working for the cleanup effort .

The disparity between what BP promised in its March 24 filing with federal regulators and the amount of oil recovered since the April 20 explosion underscores what some officials and environmental groups call a misleading numbers game that has led to widespread confusion about the extent of the spill and the progress of the recovery . `` It 's clear they overreached , '' said John F. Young Jr. , council chairman in Louisiana 's Jefferson Parish . `` I think the federal government should have at the very least picked up a phone and started asking some questions and challenged them about the accuracy of that number and tested the veracity of that claim . '' In a March report that was not questioned by federal officials , BP said it had the capacity to skim and remove 491,721 barrels of oil each day in the event of a major spill . As of Monday , with about 2 million barrels released into the gulf , the skimming operations that were touted as key to preventing environmental disaster have averaged less than 900 barrels a day . Skimming has captured only 67,143 barrels , and BP has relied on burning to remove 238,095 barrels . Most of the oil recovered -- about 632,410 barrels -- was captured directly at the site of the leaking well . BP officials declined to comment on the validity of early skimming projections , stressing instead the company 's commitment to building relief wells intended to shut down the still-gushing well . `` The numbers are what they are , '' said BP spokesman Toby Odone . `` At some point , we will look back and say why the numbers ended up this way . That 's for the future . Right now , we are doing all we can to capture and collect the oil through various methods . We will make sure all the oil is ultimately dealt with . '' BP began downgrading expectations only two days after the rig explosion . Although its projections reported to the federal government were only weeks old , the company cited a greatly reduced number in a news release filed with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission . It projected that it had `` skimming capacity of more than 171,000 barrels per day , with more available if needed . '' The release presented an optimistic picture of a company scrambling to clean up the mess , mobilizing a `` flotilla of vessels and resources that includes : significant mechanical recovery capacity . '' In truth , the skimming effort was hampered from the start by numerous factors , including the slow response of emergency workers , inadequate supplies and equipment , untrained cleanup crews and inclement weather . Greatly compounding the problem was the nature of the spill , with much of the oil never surfacing . The poor results of the skimming operations have led to a desperate search for solutions . The world 's largest skimmer , owned by the Taiwanese , is on site and undergoing Coast Guard safety tests . The 10-story-high ship , which is the length of three football fields , was touted as having the ability to remove oil at the rate of tens of thousands of barrels every day . Thus far , it has been unable to produce those results in the gulf . News , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

Hayward is looking to shore up BP 's standing with foreign partners , investors and host countries . In recent visits to Russia and Azerbaijan , he reaffirmed the company 's commitment to exploration projects there , and he told reporters in the United Arab Emirates Wednesday that he had a `` very good '' meeting with the crown prince , Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan . Hayward heads next to Angola , where BP has deep-water offshore exploration and production projects . Meanwhile , the company is also looking to shore up its finances , pressing ahead with plans to raise $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion by selling `` non-core '' assets over the next year . Industry sources familiar with the negotiations said this week that investors -- including U.S. and European oil firms , BP 's Russian partners , and one of China 's state oil companies -- have been approached about buying BP oil and gas production assets in countries including Argentina , Venezuela , Vietnam , Indonesia and Algeria . BP also may look to sell some of its 35 percent interest in Alaska 's aging Prudhoe Bay field , some sources said , though others said the company would not want to do anything to raise fears that it is reducing its U.S. exposure . The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private . Brian Youngberg , an oil analyst with Edward Jones , said that BP has sold an average of $ 2.5 billion a year of assets over the past three years as part of the normal repositioning strategy . `` Companies routinely buy and sell assets , '' he said . `` This would be just a bit more than normal . '' `` BP will have no trouble selling these assets , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. . China , which is expanding oil holdings worldwide , might want reserves in Venezuela or Asia . Gheit also said that Exxon Mobil might use the opportunity to try to buy minority positions in some of BP 's extensive holdings off the coast of West Africa . BP 's assets in Argentina may be the most likely to go . When it bought Amoco , BP acquired 60 percent of a venture that has boosted output from an aging field , which now produces 100,000 barrels a day of oil and 450 million cubic feet a year of natural gas . Gheit said other oil companies with fields in Argentina might be able to operate BP 's fields profitably because of economies of scale . BP denied reports that it was looking for a sovereign wealth fund to take a big equity stake in the company , much as Middle East investors propped up the shares of beleaguered U.S. financial firms by taking substantial minority stakes . But BP spokesman Andrew Gowers said that `` we are talking to investors about the attractions of coming into BP at current attractive prices . '' He said Hayward 's message was `` we welcome new shareholders on our register or existing shareholders who see an opportunity to top up . '' Abu Dhabi 's crown prince is also head of the emirate 's sovereign wealth fund . Sovereign funds are already big BP shareholders . They include the government of Norway , which reported on May 1 that it bought a 1.7 percent stake ; the People 's Bank of China with 1.1 percent ; the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation with 1.07 percent ; and the Kuwait Investment Authority with 1.75 percent . In a strong day for stock markets , BP jumped $ 1.28 a share , or 4 percent , to $ 33.19 a share on the New York Stock Exchange .

The company plans to change caps on the gusher , a tricky task that could greatly improve the ability to capture the oil or perhaps even shut down the well -- but that would permit oil to flow unabated during the switch . The company had planned to change the cap only after first connecting the well to a new ship at the site , the Helix Producer , which can siphon up to 25,000 barrels of oil a day . But with a window of calm weather forecast for the next week or so , BP has accelerated its plans , administration officials said Thursday . This burst of activity comes as a relief well is nearing the blown-out borehole . BP and administration officials say that if the weather holds and all the technology works as planned , they could begin the process of permanently plugging the well within two weeks . With so much about to happen at the blowout site , the Obama administration on Thursday gave BP officials 24 hours to provide a detailed description of what they will do in the weeks ahead and how they will do it . In a letter to BP , National Incident Commander Thad Allen also asked for a series of backup plans to be put into effect if events took unpredicted turns . `` They have said to our people this is how they 'd like to proceed . We have questions about that , so we 're asking a series of questions , making sure that everything has been carefully thought through before we move into agreeing to sort of a simultaneous process , '' said a senior administration official . On another front , the administration was dealt a setback when an appeals court rejected its request to reinstate its moratorium on deep-water drilling . With the break in the weather , BP and the administration appeared to be projecting conflicting views on how quickly the leak might finally be killed . In interviews on Wednesday , BP 's managing director , Bob Dudley , raised the possibility of success before the end of July . `` In a perfect world with no interruptions , it 's possible to be ready to stop the well between July 20 and July 27 , '' Dudley told the Wall Street Journal . But he also said that perfect case was `` unlikely '' because of the threat of hurricanes . On Thursday , Allen pointedly stuck to the official government estimate that the leak will be plugged by mid-August . If the effort succeeded earlier , Allen said , `` we 'd all jump for joy . '' He cautioned , however , that the oil could be flowing up several different pathways inside the 10-inch steel casing , which has a seven-inch pipe inside it . It is unknown whether the oil and gas are flowing inside those structures , in the space between them or both . Consequently , the relief well will succeed only when its drill penetrates the right layer or layers . `` We ca n't bet on getting it the first time , '' he said . Allen said the relief-well drill will be in place to penetrate the leaking borehole in seven to 10 days -- a time frame more precise than any given before . The process of filling the hole with mud and then plugging it with concrete will take seven to 10 more days and , he said , might have to be done a number of times , depending on where in the well the oil and gas are flowing .

This was no ordinary business trip for Pointer , who buys seafood for 38 Whole Foods Market grocery stores in the mid-Atlantic region . At every step along the journey between what 's caught in the sea and what lands inside Washington area supermarkets , fear about the impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is palpable : Will the oil creep into the South Atlantic this summer , imperiling Pointer 's reliable bounty of fish ? Will this be one of his last big catches of tuna and `` swords '' until the oil comes ? `` The oil is going to get here eventually , even if BP capped the well today , '' said Pointer , 42 , head of the Whole Foods mid-Atlantic seafood processing facility in Prince George 's County . `` I 'm no scientist , but I 'm also not a moron . If oil comes here , it would be a heck of a lot bigger impact for us '' because fish from the South Atlantic is a much larger part of the store 's seafood sales . The story of one catch of tuna and swordfish -- starting 120 miles off the Florida coast at Cape Canaveral and ending with Whole Foods customers in Annapolis -- is a chain of rattled players in the seafood industry , all hundreds of miles from the gulf . The oil spill has inflated how much Pointer spends on gulf shrimp by $ 2 to $ 4 a pound , but his bigger worry is the fate of his South Atlantic tuna and swordfish . Whole Foods prides itself on selling fish with labeling that clearly notes its source . But if South Atlantic fisheries are shut down , Pointer would buy more imported fish , which sometimes can not be traced back to ensure that it meets the environmental standards of Whole Foods . Or Pointer will pay higher prices for domestic tuna and swordfish caught farther north off the East Coast . Either of those strategies would trigger harsh consequences for other players along the supply chain : When Pointer pursues imports , that hurts Scott Taylor , a partner of Day Boat Seafood , a Florida company that relies on buyers such as Whole Foods to pay premium prices for seafood caught using rigorous environmental standards . Already , Taylor said , the oil spill has damaged his business , first when tuna and swordfish production in the gulf along Florida 's panhandle declined and then when cheaper foreign imports flooded the market , lowering the price Taylor can command for his domestic tuna and swordfish by $ 1 to $ 1.50 a pound . `` The consumer does n't stop eating , '' Taylor said . `` It 's just that more dollars are flowing overseas to a different source . I had one of my customers tell me that he bought a swordfish from a dealer in Boston '' for less than Taylor charges for a Florida fish -- and that fish was from South Africa . The fishing industry 's woes will only worsen if oil lands in South Florida and the South Atlantic . Last week , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a forecast showing a `` 61 to 80 percent '' chance that oil sheen , tar balls and other oil remnants would come within 20 miles of Florida 's east coast from the Keys to Fort Lauderdale by Aug. 18 . Giant Food , based in Landover , said in a statement that the oil spill has `` minimally affected '' its seafood business ; a Safeway spokesman declined to comment . On a recent Wednesday morning , Pointer pulled his SUV up to a dock in Fort Pierce , Fla. , about an hour north of West Palm Beach , to meet up with Day Boat Seafood 's Taylor . A long-liner docked , and Pointer moved closer to see what was being hauled out : First , dozens of slick yellowfin tuna , beheaded , their yellow pointy fins framing their shiny gray skin , their dark red flesh oozing out . Next : swordfish , also beheaded , with white and pink flesh and tight veins embroidering the white meat . Pointer needed to buy about 4,500 pounds of fish . He had to decide which fish -- ideally , the most aesthetically pleasing meat -- pronto . His delivery truck was leaving later that afternoon , scheduled to arrive at the Whole Foods plant in Landover by Friday morning , so the fish could make it to stores that day for the weekend buying rush .

The stakes are high for BP , the Obama administration and the Gulf of Mexico . For a day or two , the damaged wellhead will gush anew -- with the estimated 15,000 barrels of oil a day that had been captured by the old cap now flowing freely . But if all goes well , said BP senior vice president Kent Wells , additional ships and a sturdier cap with a tighter seal will be in place in four to seven days . The new system would capture most or even all of the oil leaking from the damaged BP well . Ships would also be able to disconnect from the new system faster in the event of a hurricane and reconnect faster afterward . `` We 're on plan , '' Wells said in a conference call Saturday evening . The old cap was removed at 12:30 p.m. local time Saturday , uncorking the steel pipe on top of the blowout preventer on the sea floor , one mile below the surface . Although the amount of oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico abruptly increased , a new ship on the scene , the Helix Producer I , is being hooked up to lines that should enable it to capture 25,000 barrels a day of oil -- more than offsetting the capacity lost by the removal of the old cap . The Helix owners said the ship was connected overnight Friday to a free-standing riser pipe and should be ready to start sucking up oil and gas by Sunday afternoon . It will separate the oil and transfer it to a tanker called the Loch Rannoch . With the extra collection capacity , BP would no longer need to burn oil channeled to the surface . BP and its contractors are racing against the next storm , which could throw plans off course . For the next week to 10 days , though , the weather and seas are expected to be calm and the company got the go-ahead from the national incident commander , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , to push ahead changing the cap without waiting for the Helix Producer to be hooked up . The operation is not expected to affect another system that is collecting about 10,000 barrels a day . The suspense is heightened by BP 's poor track record ; several earlier efforts to slow or stop the leak have failed . The new `` total sealing cap '' -- nearly 160,000 pounds and more than 30 feet tall -- would be installed in two pieces over the next four to seven days ; on Saturday it was still on one of the boats on the surface . The cap has many of the same components as the blowout preventer that failed to close the well after the accident . Three rams would allow the company to seal the well from the top if it chose to do so . BP and its contractors have been working on the cap since the days after the accident and designed it to be smaller than a standard blowout preventer , keeping its weight down to better withstand the storm season . The new cap can also endure high pressure from the well , enabling BP to test the conditions inside the hole by pushing back against the oil and gas surging from below -- estimated at 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day . The live video feeds from the mile-deep construction site showed a dance of machines that was choreographed from surface ships .

The April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig and the massive oil spill that has stemmed from the accident have prompted 10 formal investigations , and more could be coming . Who 's in charge : Seven-member team co-chaired by former Florida governor and former U.S. senator Bob Graham , and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William K. Reilly . Focus : Commission is tasked with providing recommendations on how to prevent -- and mitigate the impact of -- any future spills that result from offshore drilling . Status : Initial hearings being held July 12 and July 13 . Who 's in charge : Coast Guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -LRB- formerly known as the Minerals Management Service -RRB- . Focus : To identify the factors leading to the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig . Status of investigation : Two sessions of hearings in May . A third session is scheduled for later this month . First session investigated the circumstances surrounding the fire , explosion , pollution and sinking of the rig . Second session focused on gathering information on the rig 's materiel condition , crew qualifications , emergency preparedness and casualty timeline . The third session of hearings will focus on the `` how '' and the `` why . '' Highlights : Documents and testimony showed that work on the well was behind schedule and over budget , that the well plan was changed several times shortly before the accident , and that BP decided not to perform a test on the mud at the bottom of the well before starting to place the final cement lining , which experts think was a likely source of the gas that eventually blew out the well .

Traditionally , American environmentalism wins its biggest victories after some important piece of American environment is poisoned , exterminated or set on fire . An oil spill and a burning river in 1969 led to new anti-pollution laws in the 1970s . The Exxon Valdez disaster helped create an Earth Day revival in 1990 and sparked a landmark clean-air law . But this year , the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- and , before that , the worst coal-mining disaster in 40 years -- have n't put the same kind of drive into the debate over climate change and fossil-fuel energy . The Senate is still gridlocked . Opinion polls have n't budged much . Gasoline demand is going up , not down . Environmentalists say they 're trying to turn public outrage over oil-smeared pelicans into action against more abstract things , such as oil dependence and climate change . But historians say they 're facing a political moment deadened by a bad economy , suspicious politics and lingering doubts after a scandal over climate scientists ' e-mails . The difference between now and the awakenings that followed past disasters is as stark as `` on versus off , '' said Anthony Leiserowitz , a researcher at Yale University who tracks public opinion on climate change . `` People 's outrage is focused on BP , '' Leiserowitz said . The spill `` has n't been automatically connected to some sense that there 's something more fundamental wrong with our relationship with the natural world , '' he said . The story of 2010 is not that nothing happened after the BP spill , or after the coal-mine explosion that killed 29 in West Virginia on April 5 . It 's that much of the reaction has focused on preventing accidents -- on tighter scrutiny of rigs and mines -- rather than broader changes in the use of oil and coal . On Capitol Hill , Sen. Jeff Merkley -LRB- D-Ore . -RRB- recently proposed a plan to cut oil use by shifting to electric vehicles , building better mass-transit systems and switching to biofuels . But the Senate 's most important environmental debate , the one over climate legislation , remains stalled . Last year , the House of Representatives passed legislation that would create a `` cap and trade '' system for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions . That bill probably wo n't fly in the Senate -- too much concern over rising energy costs -- and a compromise is still being worked out . `` It 's the short-term concerns overriding the longer-term benefits '' of curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , said Ralph Izzo , chief executive of the Public Service Enterprise Group , a large New Jersey-based utility that supports putting a price on carbon emissions . Meanwhile , for the environmental groups trying to break this logjam , it 's hard to imagine a more useful disaster .

BP engineers are hopeful that by week 's end they will have placed a perfect seal over the well , which began bleeding oil into the gulf April 20 after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , in which 11 workers died . `` We did an extensive amount of preparation work in terms of planning and installation , and we 're pleased at this point on how it 's going , '' said Kent Wells , a BP senior vice president , referring to the removal early Sunday morning of the top flange on the leaking well and the installation of a device that will eventually connect the new cap to the well . Wells said the maneuvers , which are being conducted in large part by robotic submarines a mile under the water 's surface , are going smoothly partly because of a window of good weather and calm seas . Separately , the Sunday Times of London reported that BP is in talks to sell about $ 10 billion in assets , including a share of its Alaska oil production , to Apache , a large U.S. independent oil company . A sale that size would cover about half the amount of money BP has promised to put in an escrow fund to cover claims related to the spill . BP owns 26 percent of the Prudhoe Bay field , the biggest in the United States , and five other fields on Alaska 's North Slope . But the field is past its prime . More than half the oil has been produced from the Prudhoe Bay field ; production , a fraction of its peak , is dropping about 10 percent a year , BP has said . On Saturday , robots removed the cap that had been placed on top of the leak in early June to collect the oil and send it to surface ships for collection or burning . That move allows the well to spew oil in an uncontrolled manner until the new cap is installed . BP said a containment ship , the Helix Producer , steamed into place over the well and was expected to begin collecting oil Sunday night or early Monday . Federal officials say the well is releasing as much as 2.5 million gallons of oil a day . The old cap collected about 1 million gallons , according to the government . BP officials say that once the new cap and a new containment vessel are in place , the system will be capable of capturing 2.5 million to 3.4 million gallons daily . Still , it would be a temporary fix ; BP hopes to plug the leak permanently by mid-August . Meanwhile , the Justice Department has started interviewing witnesses as part of the criminal and civil probe of the spill .

The presidential commission appointed to study the causes of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and to recommend improvements for offshore drilling has navigated tight spots as it prepares to begin work this week . Unlike the commissions that investigated space-shuttle accidents and the Three Mile Island nuclear incident , the Deepwater panel must analyze what went wrong while things still are going wrong . That real-time analysis of a catastrophe `` makes this commission pretty unusual , '' said Amy Zegart , an associate professor at UCLA 's School of Public Affairs who has studied the more than 600 presidential commissions convened in the past two decades . The seven-member commission , which holds hearings Monday and Tuesday in New Orleans , also must find its role amid eight other investigations -- and a Justice Department probe -- into the April 20 explosion that killed 11 and sent oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico . Created by President Obama in a May 22 executive order , the commission faces questions about whether it has the expertise and objectivity to deliver credible and compelling recommendations . The New Orleans sessions start a six-month clock for delivering a final report to the president . Members will tour communities in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida before converging for hearings in New Orleans , which commission co-chairman William K. Reilly said will `` give voice to the region . '' The closing hours of each session will be devoted to testimony from local people and state officials affected by the spill . Reilly was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush during the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . He sits on the board of directors of ConocoPhillips , from which he has taken a temporary leave . His co-chairman is Bob Graham , the former governor and later senator from Florida who led efforts against offshore drilling on that state 's coasts . The commission begins work without its own budget , without subpoena power and while it is filling its expected 35 full-time staff slots . Obama asked Congress to approve $ 15 million for the commission , which was cut to $ 12 million by the House and is under debate in the Senate . For now , the commission is relying on $ 4 million that came through the Energy Department , Graham said . In a teleconference Friday , both Graham and Reilly said the commission hopes to improve the safety of offshore drilling by understanding what went wrong with the BP site . That focus turns on how -- not whether -- to drill offshore . Graham said the commission hopes `` to answer the question of what can be done to make this activity significantly safer . '' Reilly said that resolving questions surrounding a deep-water drilling moratorium `` is not going to be a priority of the commission . '' He noted that the issue is getting attention in federal court from the industry and the administration . Reilly said he also expects the commission to question other decisions that `` look irregular to the casual observer .

The gulf 's near-unique geology and millions of years of river flow account for the area 's exceptionally rich deposits . -LRB- Dave Martin\\/Associated Press -RRB- In the oil business , geologists tell stories . Here was a river , they will say . Here was a shallow sea . Here is where the sea dried up and left only salt . Here is where the sea formed anew , and widened , and deepened , and where sediments from another river , and the carcasses of microorganisms , were deposited , buried , baked , until finally -- the enchanting payoff of the story if you 're an eager-beaver oil executive -- the organic matter turned into oil . The Gulf of Mexico is full of such stories . Unfortunately , the story of one well , named Macondo , drilled by the rig Deepwater Horizon , has turned into a tragedy . The geology of the gulf is pretty close to perfect for the creation of oil reservoirs . There are salt sheets and domes that form impermeable caps on oil fields . There are abundant rock formations that have been deformed into hump-shaped strata known as anticlines , natural traps for oil . `` It traps oil and gas beautifully , '' said Roger Anderson , a Columbia University geophysicist who has long studied Gulf of Mexico geology . Anderson compares the deep-water gulf to Texas and Oklahoma more than a century ago . The `` oil patch '' had its famous moments , such as the Spindletop gusher in Beaumont , Tex. , in 1901 , which blew out at 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons -RRB- per day , and the Wild Mary well , which spewed out of control for 11 days in Oklahoma City in 1930 . That region still produces , but there are n't many big discoveries still to be made in the pincushioned ground . Not so the deep water . There 's oil out there , in reservoirs that can top a billion barrels . `` It 's like the old days . It 's true frontier , '' Anderson says . It 's not the only such place in the world . There 's abundant oil in deep water off the coasts of Brazil and West Africa , for example . But the gulf has its own near-unique geology , shaped by the great river that flows into it . The Mighty Mississippi , the Father of Waters , drains almost everything from the Rockies to the Appalachians . Millions of years ago , the Red River , which forms part of the Texas\\/Oklahoma border , was as big as the Mississippi . These rivers dumped dead organisms into the gulf in prodigious quantities . Those nutrients help feed thriving ecosystems and some of the richest fisheries in the world . But the gulf is also an isolated sea , almost walled off from the Atlantic Ocean by Cuba and the Florida and Yucatan peninsulas . That means the gulf lacks the deep-water circulation of open ocean . Bad circulation means lots of anoxic layers , dead zones , places where there 's so little oxygen that organic matter does n't decay . That 's great for the eventual creation of an oil field . `` What oil and gas is is undecayed dead organisms . Microorganisms , not dinosaurs . So the small foraminifera and algae that lived in the ocean and lived in the Mississippi River died and got swept out to sea and got buried under all the mud coming out of the Mississippi . As it got deeper and deeper , it got hotter and hotter and got cooked into oil , '' Anderson said . Ken Deffeyes , a retired Princeton geologist who once worked for Shell Oil and has written about the gulf , said , `` The Mississippi Delta and the Niger Delta are the only two really productive , big deltas in the world .

The drama in the depths off the coast of Louisiana unfolded as , in Washington , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar issued a new moratorium on offshore drilling , trying a new tack to get around an injunction issued recently by a New Orleans federal judge . Instead of banning offshore drilling based on water depth , he barred drilling by the types of rigs and equipment used in deep water . An Interior Department spokesman said that none of the 33 rigs whose work was interrupted in May would be able to resume their activity . `` I am basing my decision on evidence that grows every day of the industry 's inability in the deep water to contain a catastrophic blowout , respond to an oil spill and to operate safely , '' Salazar said . BP and its oil-industry allies hope that in the days ahead they will gain the upper hand on the Macondo well , drilled by the Deepwater Horizon rig and spewing oil since the fatal blowout April 20 . If all goes perfectly , the well could stop polluting the gulf before it is plugged at its base with mud and concrete . On Saturday , BP yanked away the `` top hat '' containment cap that had been lopsidedly parked on the well since early last month . Over the next 48 hours , technicians used robotic submersibles and hardware lowered from the surface to reconfigure the well 's outlet . Instead of the jagged hole of the sheared-off riser pipe , the well was fitted with a new , simple chimney-like opening , which Monday spurted a plume of oil made frothy by injected chemical dispersants . The new chimney enabled BP to deploy a huge structure known as the `` 3 ram capping stack . '' It has three valves that can be used to close the flow of oil . First it had to be installed -- no slam-dunk in the cold , dark , highly pressurized deep-sea environment , where ice-like methane hydrates can quickly form and clog openings . With the new cap in place , oil and gas still flow out a perforated pipe at the top of the stack . Next will come the critical `` integrity test . '' It 's really a pressure test . How the well performs in the test will shape everything that follows . Before the test begins , BP will stop collecting oil from the well . Although the top hat , which funneled oil to a surface ship , is no longer in the picture , there is still oil flowing to a surface rig called the Q4000 via a line attached to the blowout preventer . The Q4000 has been burning about 8,000 barrels -LRB- 336,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day . On Monday , a new ship , the Helix Producer , began siphoning oil through a different line connected to the blowout preventer . That ship potentially could capture up to 25,000 barrels a day if ramped to full production . To test the well 's integrity , BP will gradually shut down the flow of oil and gas until the flow stops -- nothing out the top , nothing to surface ships . BP engineers and government scientists will scrutinize the pressure building in the well . `` Higher pressures are good news . They indicate that the well bore has integrity , '' said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer . If the pressure does n't rise as expected , that will suggest that the well has been damaged below the seafloor . Suttles played down the possibility that the test could damage the well and cause leaks into the surrounding rock formation . But clearly these will be anxious moments in the gulf . `` The last thing you want to happen is have the well blow out and collapse around the wellhead , '' said Greg McCormack , director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas . `` When that happens , you have a heck of a time killing that well . '' `` You can think of it as this great big faucet that we 're going to slowly crank down and turn off the flow and then check the pressure over a period of time , '' BP spokesman Steve Rinehart said Monday . The pressure readings will offer clues to what 's happening out of sight , below the gulf floor , in the well bore , Rinehart said . `` Will it hold ? Or will it leak out ? '' If the pressure test suggests that the well has n't been compromised , BP will leave the well `` shut in . '' That wo n't mean the well is dead . The killing of the well is still the job of the relief well . About the end of this month , Suttles said , BP will intercept the Macondo well and attempt to kill it with heavy mud and then concrete . The deep-sea activity and Washington political pronouncements formed a backdrop for the first public hearing by the presidential commission investigating the spill . Oystermen and sports anglers described businesses in peril . A senior Coast Guard official testified that tar balls will wash up for `` weeks , if not months . '' Some witnesses pleaded for the commission to take a stand on the drilling moratorium . Among the most vocal were representatives of companies that service the oil industry . They contended that jobs will be lost permanently and that rigs will leave the region . Larry Dickerson , chief executive of Diamond Offshore Drilling , said two deep-water rigs that had employed 150 people will move to Egypt and West Africa rather than wait out the ban . He speculated that the cause of the Deepwater Horizon disaster will be found to be `` reckless operating mistakes , '' probably tied to pressure to hasten drilling . His employees , Dickerson said , talk about the federal bailout of the auto industry : `` They ask how come they get bailed out and we get driven out ?

He quickly replaced the cover and stepped back , letting the scent register for a few seconds . Wilson , chief quality officer for NOAA 's seafood inspection program , oversees a panel of seven olfactory experts from the agency and the Food and Drug Administration who have been tasked with ensuring that seafood from the Gulf of Mexico is safe to eat . The team also will help determine when the thousands of square miles of federal waters that have been closed to commercial fishing since the BP oil spill nearly three months ago can be reopened . This puts the fate of the seafood industry in their hands . Or , rather , their noses . `` It 's a very specialized skill set , '' Wilson said . He later added , `` There are people who just ca n't smell . '' Members of the team -- whose identities NOAA has kept secret , for fear they could become targets if waters do not reopen quickly , allowing fishing to resume -- do not work alone . Seafood that passes the smell test also is subjected to chemical analysis at a NOAA lab in Seattle for traces of the hydrocarbons that make up the crude oil gushing into the gulf . But those tests can take at least three to five days to complete , while so-called `` expert sensory assessors '' can sniff through as many as 36 samples each day and detect contaminants down to one part per million . All seven have to sniff and rate each sample . Wilson said the sniffers are accurate about 80 percent of the time . NOAA said it is focusing most of its tests on seafood outside closed waters to ensure that it remains safe for consumption . No tainted seafood has been found in those areas , agency officials said . `` So far , it 's adequate , '' said Walt Dickhoff , who runs the chemical testing team in Seattle . `` We 're just monitoring it to be certain .

States control waters nearer to shore , and Louisiana has shut down 76 percent of the 2.1 million acres of water where oysters are harvested , according to state officials .

'' The best-case scenario for the test is that it would halt the spewing of the well . But the well could fail the test -- and the gusher would return . Federal authorities and BP engineers want to see the test create a steady increase in well pressure . This would suggest that the Macondo well is intact , and that oil and gas are not leaking into the surrounding mud and rock formations below the gulf floor . The well blew out April 20 and destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig , killing 11 men . If the pressure readings are too low , BP 's technicians will abandon the test and , using robotic submersibles , will reopen the valves . BP will resume trying to capture as much leaking oil as possible while continuing to drill a relief well that could kill Macondo with mud and concrete . `` Everybody hope and pray that we see high pressures here , '' BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said Tuesday . `` Bear with us . Let 's do this test . '' The test could take at least two days . If authorities determine that the well can remain closed -- `` shut in , '' to use the oil industry terminology -- then Macondo would no longer pollute the gulf , and ships would stop collecting or burning oil and gas . The relief well is getting close . It 's four feet laterally from Macondo , with about 150 feet more to drill vertically until the interception . But the target is narrow -- a steel casing slightly less than 10 inches wide , with a seven-inch pipe inside . The final stages are painstaking , and BP and the government still say the bottom-kill is not likely to take place until August . Allen set up camp in Houston on Tuesday with Energy Secretary Steven Chu for what the retired admiral had anticipated would be `` a consequential day . '' The new `` 3 ram capping stack '' was lowered without a hitch onto the reconfigured blowout preventer Monday night . A new surface ship , the Helix Producer , was also connected to the well via the `` kill line '' on the blowout preventer , and by Tuesday morning was siphoning about 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day , Wells said . About 8,000 barrels -LRB- 336,000 gallons -RRB- a day have been siphoned and burned through the surface rig Q4000 . Those containment efforts will be halted to conduct the integrity test , Wells said . The possibility of shutting in the well from the top was raised by BP in the past few weeks . The oil company has expressed concern many times about trying to seal the well from the top , citing fears about the condition of the well below the gulf floor . During the `` top kill '' attempt in May , the well was taking as much mud as engineers were pumping into it . It was not clear whether the mud was leaking into the rock formations or shooting out the cracks and openings in the pipe above the blowout preventer . In a recent interview with The Washington Post , Wells said BP had become increasingly confident that the mud had flowed out the top . He did not elaborate . During a conference call Monday , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles was asked why the new sealing cap and the shut-in strategy had not been attempted earlier . He defended the company 's strategy , saying that certain steps could be taken only after engineers had gathered information about the well . A major concern all along was to avoid anything to make the situation worse , he said . `` The problem is , I 've had to take these steps to learn the things I 've learned , '' he said . `` Without taking those steps , it 's unlikely that I would have known what I know now .

But the full story of the Exxon Valdez wreck is far more complex , and it offers striking parallels to today 's events in the Gulf of Mexico -- including a central role played by a consortium led by British Petroleum , now known as BP . A commission that investigated the Alaska spill found that oil companies cut corners to maximize profits . Systems intended to prevent disaster failed , and no backups were in place . Regulators were too close to the oil industry and approved woefully inadequate accident response and cleanup plans . History is repeating , say officials who investigated the Valdez , because the lessons of two decades ago remain unheeded . `` It 's disappointing , '' said 84-year-old Walt Parker , chairman of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission , which made dozens of recommendations for preventing a recurrence . `` It 's almost as though we had never written the report . '' Marine experts predict that the many panels investigating the Deepwater Horizon blowout -- including a presidential commission that began work this week in New Orleans -- will produce reports with numerous findings that could have been cut and pasted from the 20-year-old report written by Parker 's commission or another body that examined the Valdez accident . They also fear those findings may have no more impact than the Valdez conclusions have . In the immediate aftermath of the Alaska spill , as in the gulf , there was confusion over who was in charge -- oil companies or government officials . Federal authorities eventually asserted themselves but lacked the equipment and personnel to stem the damage . Storms slowed the response and spread contamination . Cleanup technology was old and ineffective . Environmentalists questioned the toxicity of dispersants and asked whether oil companies were using chemicals to hide damage . The vast Alaska containment effort recovered only a fraction of the millions of gallons of oil dumped into Prince William Sound . The players in the Alaskan drama also look familiar . Although Exxon owned the Valdez tanker , it was not responsible for the flawed emergency response plan and did not lead initial containment efforts . Those jobs fell to the Alyeska Pipeline Service , a consortium operating the Trans Alaska Pipeline System . The consortium 's controlling partner was British Petroleum . British Petroleum also supplied the consortium 's top executive , who later resigned under pressure . `` BP called the shots , '' said Tom Lakosh , an oil spill researcher . The Alaskan commission concluded that cost-cutting by Alyeska contributed to the disaster , just as critics allege that BP 's focus on profits contributed to the gulf spill . `` British Petroleum 's leadership essentially was ` asleep at the switch , ' '' the commission 's report concluded .

BP said that the leak in what is known as the choke line could be repaired and that its effort to close the damaged well , and shut down the flow of oil permanently , would resume . But video streams from the seafloor showed a chaotic plume of oil and gas continuing to surge from one of the outlets on the 75-ton cap installed earlier this week . It was unclear late Wednesday whether the leak would be a momentary hitch in the much-anticipated `` integrity test '' on the well , or if it would put the operation in grave peril . But the plumbing failure showed once again that nothing has come easy in the long campaign to kill the Macondo well , which blew out April 20 and destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig , killing 11 workers . Federal officials green-lighted the test after a 24-hour delay , during which government scientists and outside experts demanded more information from BP about possible hazards posed by stopping the flow of the well . They are concerned that a spike in pressure as the flow is clamped could blow oil and gas out of the casing of the well and into the geological formations . Throughout the crisis , engineers have feared the possibility that efforts to fix the problem could make it worse . Such concerns ultimately did not dissuade authorities from going forward with what could be a high-reward maneuver . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander , said that , notwithstanding the concerns of scientists , he is `` gung ho '' about the test . `` It will be terrific news if we can shut in the well , '' Allen said , adding , however , `` I do n't want to get anyone 's hopes up . '' Once BP engineers closed the main chimney on the new `` capping stack '' installed atop the well Monday night , that left oil and gas surging from two other ports . The protocol developed by BP and approved by federal authorities called for quickly closing one , known as the kill line , then very gradually reducing the flow from the choke line until the well flows no more . The company said Wednesday night in a statement that the leak in the choke line `` has been isolated and will be repaired prior to starting the test . '' Federal officials and BP engineers are anxiously observing what happens to pressures in the well . A steady increase in pressure as the flow is reduced would be a strong sign that the Macondo well , drilled by the now-sunken rig Deepwater Horizon , is physically intact , and that oil and gas are not leaking into the surrounding mud and rock formations below the gulf floor .

He is Robert Craft , not Robert Kraft . Oil leak is stopped for first time since April 20 blowout The gusher is gone . The plume is off the well . BP 's Macondo well is n't dead yet , and it may be back in a flash , but at 3:25 p.m. Eastern time Thursday it ceased to spew oil into the Gulf of Mexico . As part of what BP calls an `` integrity test , '' a robotic submersible slowly closed a valve on the well 's new sealing cap . That choked the flow until the plume , a fixture of cable TV and many a nightmare , disappeared . The technological breakthrough came 87 days into the crisis , which began with the April 20 blowout that killed 11 workers and sent the burning rig Deepwater Horizon to the bottom of the gulf . BP could nix the test at any moment and reopen the well . Whether the well remains `` shut in , '' to use the industry term , depends on the analysis of pressures in the well . Engineers and scientists hope to see high pressure hold steady during the 48-hour period allotted for the test . That would suggest that the well bore is physically intact . Lower pressure would hint of breaches in the casing and leakage into the surrounding rock . The initial pressure readings are in an ambiguous range , and officials will have to make a difficult judgment call on whether to keep the well shut in or reopen it , according to Tom Hunter , retired director of the Sandia National Laboratories and a member of the federal government 's scientific team overseeing the test . `` If it were a lot higher , it would be an easier decision to make , '' Hunter said . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander , has said that a pressure reading of 8,000 or 9,000 pounds per square inch would be ideal , while below 6,000 psi might indicate leakage . Hunter , who witnessed the test from BP 's war room in Houston , told The Washington Post that the pressure rose to about 6,700 psi and appeared likely to level out `` closer to 7,000 . '' He said one possibility is that the reservoir has lost pressure as it has depleted itself the past three months . `` It 's just premature to tell . We just do n't know whether something is leaking or not , '' Hunter said . Seismic and sonar surveys will scout for evidence of oil and gas moving through the geological formations . Robotic submersibles are scrutinizing the muddy gulf floor and the base of the well 's blowout preventer , looking for signs of rising hydrocarbons . Allen issued a statement late in the day saying that , although he is encouraged by the latest developments , a return to the containment strategy `` remains likely . '' Reopening the well would not be a sign of failure , Hunter said , because , with the new cap -- the `` 3 ram capping stack '' -- on top of the well since Monday night , BP has more options for capturing the hydrocarbons . As many as four ships could soon give BP the capacity to collect between 60,000 and 80,000 barrels a day , which exceeds even the highest government estimate for what 's coming out of the well . `` No matter what comes out of this entire operation , we 're going to be in a much better position than we were before , '' Allen said .

At the Purple Octopus souvenir shop , the naughty T-shirts and hermit-crab houses still were n't selling . But there still something different , hopeful about this day . There was news to watch : a cap on BP 's leaking well , and tests to determine if it would hold . If the well really was capped , it still would n't mean the end of this beach town 's troubles .

On Thursday , underwater submarines closed valves on a new `` containment cap , '' stopping the flow after 87 days .

There was no sign that was happening , officials said . `` At this point , there is no evidence that the well does not have integrity , '' Kent Wells , BP 's senior VP of exploration and production , said late Friday afternoon . But the pressure within the well did n't reach as high as officials had hoped , hitting about 6,700 pounds per square inch , Wells said . If the well was entirely bottled up , officials wanted to see a reading of 8,000 pounds per square inch .

That is the currenct number of Incidents of Non-Compliance reported to the agency , but not all were in the gulf ; a small percentage of the incidents occurred in Alaska or elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean . The number includes relatively minor matters such as inspection violations ; as the article reported , the number of incidents involving deaths , injuries , fires and blowouts was much lower . According to a database on the agency 's Web site , the number of serious incidents in the gulf totals 650 to 850 a year . The article also incorrectly described Frank Patton as the lead investigator of a 2009 investigation into gas rising dangerously in one well and an averted rig explosion . Patton was one of four members of an investigative team . MMS investigations of oil-rig accidents have history of inconsistency A year and a day before BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , crew members on a neighboring oil rig found themselves bracing for their own potential disaster . A dangerous gas bubble surged up a well pipe , and the blowout preventers had n't worked . The crew reported hearing a `` deafening roar '' as fluids shot up , knocking over huge metal equipment on the deck . Some workers ran to lifeboats , while others stayed behind to control the well . The accident on the rig , leased by Louisiana Land Oil and Gas -LRB- LLOG -RRB- , was one of the 12,087 oil-related incidents in the gulf reported over the past five years to the federal Minerals Management Service -- the now-revamped agency investigating the BP oil spill . The number of accidents , spills and deaths regularly occurring in the region has far surpassed the agency 's ability to investigate them . Until now , 60 inspectors were tasked with investigating all types of incidents . Between 2006 and 2009 , those included 30 worker deaths , 1,298 injuries , 514 fires and 23 blowouts that left wells out of control . They conducted 378 investigations in the gulf in roughly the same time period , with 21 considered worthy of more rigorous and extended scrutiny by a panel . As federal inspectors work to dissect the underlying causes of the BP accident -- an issue to be probed this week in a new round of joint panel hearings in Kenner , La. -- The Washington Post reviewed several dozen serious MMS investigations in recent years to assess how they were conducted and found large variations in aggressiveness and outcome . In some cases , investigators ran their own tests , tracked down witnesses and did complicated technical calculations . In others , they relied heavily on information and witness interviews provided by companies . Once their findings were forwarded to agency officials for review , many probes resulted in small fines or none at all . MMS levied financial penalties 154 times in the past five years , agency officials testified last month . Although the agency now may assess fines of up to $ 35,000 per day , in five years it collected only $ 8.5 million . Its largest fine between 2000 and 2009 was $ 697,500 , according to an MMS Web site . It took 11 months for MMS to finalize its report in the LLOG case , and along the way it sometimes accepted the accounts of company officials without probing more deeply , the report shows . Investigators asked to see a safety valve provided by a subcontractor , Halliburton Corp. . When Halliburton told investigators the device was under repair and could n't be examined , an inspector accepted the company 's assertions and data . Kendra Barkoff , an Interior Department spokeswoman , said Saturday that the valve played no role in the accident . The inquiry concluded that no rules had been broken , no fines were warranted , and the agency 's response should be to alert the industry to potential risks . Barkoff noted that `` some accidents are just that : accidents that involve no wrongdoing or criminal or negligent behavior . '' The team looking into that case was led by Frank Patton , a veteran investigator also responsible for monitoring the Deepwater Horizon rig . In recent weeks , Patton has testified that he approved a BP drilling plan that other oil companies and drilling experts have said was deeply flawed . The supervisor who approved the LLOG report was J. David Dykes , co-chairman of the joint panel with the Coast Guard that on Monday begins its second round of hearings into the BP blowout . Dykes referred questions to Barkoff , who also answered for Patton . `` Frank Patton and David Dykes ... are committed to ensuring the safety of offshore energy operation , '' Barkoff said .

Even when there 's hope of a cleanup , an accident sends us back nearly to square one . The American public is incensed , the finger-pointing refuses to end , the U.S.-British `` special relationship '' is straining , an offshore moratorium is declared but overruled , and even as the blown-out gulf well was sealed Thursday , anxiety lingered about whether the cap would hold . It 's a mess in every sense of the word . But this could be far worse . Imagine if BP were a state-owned oil company . Instead of reasoning with an incompetent chief executive , we 'd be reasoning with a protectionist prime minister . Regarding BP , this is a thought experiment . But there are plenty of state-owned companies drilling in U.S. waters and abroad . The next oil spill could be more than just an economic and environmental crisis . It could be a diplomatic one . As it is , the BP spill has caused tension between the United States and Britain . President Obama has been accused by British media and officials of xenophobia , waging a campaign of hate , and general '' Brit-bashing . '' British Prime Minister David Cameron , meanwhile , has been criticized for not taking a stronger stance in favor of BP . At a time when some are saying the `` special relationship '' is over , a tiff over BP is n't exactly what the friendship needs . Humor me and picture what would happen if BP were owned by the British government . We would be facing a situation in which a foreign government would be directly responsible for the ever-worsening spill on our domestic shores . The United States and Britain have had arguments before , and the nationalistic vitriol coming from both sides would be 10 times worse as issues of blame , recovery costs , national pride , domestic security , and economic competition are endlessly debated between leaders , economists , and cable pundits . That 's still the rosy scenario , because at least Britain is an ally . There are plenty of countries that are not , and they happen to own their oil companies -- Venezuela , China , Iran , and Russia being among the biggest . These petroleum-rich countries are placing more importance on their nationalized oil companies as a way to ensure a steady supply to guard against growing domestic demand and changing market conditions . The oil industry is dominated by state-owned companies . Multinationals might have more name recognition with the public -- ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell , BP , Chevron -- but they have full access to 6 percent of worldwide oil reserves . Eighty-eight percent of reserves are held by national oil companies , which also represent the majority of worldwide production . -LRB- It 's unknown the percentage of oil that state-owned companies get from outside their countries ' shores . -RRB- Companies such as Aramco , Petrobras , Sinopec and Pemex are n't household names , but they will be as oil becomes scarcer and they can throw around their weight even more due to their dominance of existing oil reserves . We 're already seeing potential hotspots , and the United States is n't the only country that should be worried . Chevron and Rosneft -LRB- owned by the Russian government -RRB- will begin drilling in the Shatsky Ridge of the Black Sea at the end of 2011 . The Black Sea is bordered by Russia , Georgia , Turkey , Bulgaria , Romania and Ukraine -- countries that , to put it lightly , do n't always get along . Any substantial accident would be seen as a Russian oil company contaminating its oft-slighted neighbors . Cue the international crisis . More potential trouble could happen in the South China Sea , where China-owned CNOOC continues to expand its operations . As many as 10 countries surround the South China Sea , and its importance as a major shipping zone and an area of ecological diversity can not be overstated . It is already a geopolitical hotspot , and any disaster caused by a state-owned company might unravel any diplomatic progress being made . Even the Gulf of Mexico might see trouble again . Brazil 's Petrobras drills in the gulf , and has been ramping up its operations in the area for several years . Brazil has relatively good relations with its neighbors in the Americas , but a Deepwater Horizon-style disaster could significantly change the political dynamics of the region . It does n't have to be a blown offshore platform that changes everything . Accidents can happen at any point in the supply chain . A recent death at the Port Arthur , Tex. , refinery -LRB- owned by Shell and Aramco -RRB- highlights the potential for more tension . A substantially destructive accident at any step of the oil extraction , refining or transportation process could stain relations as well . If we can be sure of one thing in the aftermath of the BP spill , it 's that it wo n't be the last . Countries have not used the BP oil spill to stop offshore development : Deepwater production is anticipated to increase by two-thirds within five years , and state-owned oil companies in general are poised to continue their strong growth . Strides in renewable energy are n't happening quickly enough to substantially reduce global demand of oil . That oil is n't plentiful enough to be extracted as easily anymore , meaning companies are using more and more potentially dangerous methods to get at it . As BP has shown , danger can only be averted for so long . Thompson-Westra is a research assistant at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .

Long , the famous Louisiana populist , launched his political career by waging war on the big oil companies , especially what he called Standard Oil 's `` invisible empire . '' `` I would rather go down to a thousand impeachments than to admit that I am the governor of the state that does not dare to call the Standard Oil Company to account , '' he declared in a 1929 campaign circular . But the threat of a thousand impeachments notwithstanding , Long later built his own invisible oil empire : In 1934 , while he was a senator , he and his political associates formed the Win or Lose Corp. . The company -- which had a reputation of never losing -- bought up state mineral leases and resold them to oil companies at a healthy profit , while keeping a share for itself . Although Long died in 1935 , his family and friends received royalties for decades . This dividend came at a price for the rest of Louisiana . The oil leases Long and his associates sold were generally in wetlands ; in the process of tapping the oil and gas below , oil companies built a sprawling network of roads and canals , leaving behind a trail of damaged marshes . Wildcat wells came to dot the state 's landscape , and refineries and port facilities followed . Today , thousands of wells have been drilled within three miles of the far-from-pristine shoreline . But it was a price Louisianans went along with : Since oil was first discovered there , the state has produced 159.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 17.5 billion barrels of oil , according to the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources . That 's as much oil as the entire United States has produced over the past nine years . Americans may be torn up by the BP oil spill and its destruction of the Gulf of Mexico 's natural habitat -- and torn up we should be -- but that habitat has not been pristine for decades . In many ways , Louisiana made its deal with the devil long ago . And what a bad deal it was . Long before the oil spill , the state 's embrace of the petroleum industry cast it under what economists call `` the resource curse '' : the paradox that countries rich in minerals or petroleum tend to grow more slowly and have lower living standards than other nations . Simply put , Louisiana is the closest thing America has to a petro-state . Instead of blessing Louisiana with prosperity , the oil industry fostered dependency , corruption and an indifference to environmental damage . Our Cajun sheikdom 's oil and gas riches -- like those of the Niger Delta , the Orinoco belt in Venezuela and the Iraqi marshes -- also stunted its development , leaving it far behind states with fewer natural resources . According to the Census Bureau and Harvard University health data , Louisiana ranks 49th among the states in life expectancy , has the second-highest rate of infant mortality , comes in fourth in violent crime , ranks 46th in percentage of people older than 25 with college degrees , and ties for second in percentage of people living below the poverty line . Oil riches did n't create these problems , of course , but it is striking that they did n't ameliorate them . `` We 've always been a plantation state , '' said Oliver Houck , an environmental law professor at Tulane University . `` What oil and gas did is replace the agricultural plantation culture with an oil and gas plantation culture . '' Even though Louisiana 's oil and gas production peaked in 1970 and many companies moved their offices to Houston , refineries , oil import facilities on the coast and a web of thousands of miles of pipelines continue to make the industry a powerful force in the state . It is embedded in Louisiana 's mental and economic infrastructure , and remains one of its leading employers . The recent development of shale gas in the northern , poorer part of the state will bolster its influence even further . All this explains why , even as the oil spill threatens Louisiana 's tourism , fisheries and shoreline , local politicians have continued to speak up on behalf of continued offshore drilling : They , and their state , are addicted to oil .

BP 's Macondo well remains dangerous , a threat to gush anew , and very much alive until it is plugged with cement in a bottom-kill that 's still weeks away at best . Criminal and civil investigations are going full bore . Exploratory drill rigs remain locked out of the deep water as the oil industry tries to prove that it knows what it 's doing . And the ecological impact is still playing out as uncounted millions of gallons of oil pollute the Gulf of Mexico . But something may have come to an end in the past few days : the sense that nothing would ever go right with this demon well . Macondo for the moment is shut in . It 's not dead , but neither has it spewed any oil into the gulf since Thursday . After a lengthy meeting between government scientists and BP engineers Saturday afternoon , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen gave BP permission to keep the well sealed for another 24 hours , extending an `` integrity test '' that strangled the well for the first time and kicked the crisis into its endgame . That could mean that the well will be reopened Sunday afternoon . Allen 's directive appeared to have been crafted to keep all options on the table , but the default position remains that the shut-in procedure will come to an end at some point . `` When this test is eventually stopped , we will immediately return to containment '' using the new , tight-fitting cap on the well and surface ships that can capture or flare oil and gas , Allen said . The shutting-in of the well was never the primary purpose of the `` 3 ram capping stack '' lowered onto the top of the well Monday night . The 75-ton cap , which replaced the loose-fitting `` top hat , '' was conceived as a mechanism to permit the capturing of more oil after it became clear that early flow rate estimates were far too low . Along the way , engineers raised the possibility that they could use the valves on the new cap to turn off the well as one might an ordinary faucet . Administration officials , including President Obama , have emphasized that a re-opening of the well would not mean a return to the same ugly scene of a billowing gusher . But the optics will be unpleasant in the short run . Re-opening the well would mean that the oily plume , omnipresent for months on cable TV and Internet feeds from the deep gulf , would return at least temporarily as engineers open the choke valve and let oil and gas vent into the gulf . `` If we make the decision to open up the well , there will be a period when oil will go back into the gulf , '' BP senior vice president Kent Wells said Saturday morning . What has been called the worst environmental crisis in U.S. history has also been a technological crisis , carrying echoes of Three Mile Island , which rattled the nuclear power industry , and Apollo 13 , which challenged engineers to fix a problem -- moon-bound astronauts in a broken spaceship -- no one had ever faced . For 87 days , from April 20 , when the Macondo well blew out and ignited a fireball on the doomed rig Deepwater Horizon , killing 11 workers , until Thursday afternoon , the well defied all plans to throttle it . The new cap gave engineers more leverage . The well could yet spring a surprise . Robotic vehicles are staring at the mud around the blowout preventer and in all directions , looking for new leaks . They 're using sonar , acoustic instruments , seismic detectors . They 're taking the temperature of the casing ; they 're sampling bubbles coming out of a valve . It 's a situation where everyone is hopeful but still checking all the closets and under the beds . Officials remain concerned about `` low probability , high consequence '' hazards . But Wells said that engineers and scientists are increasingly confident that the well is n't leaking into the geological formations . `` There 's no evidence that we do n't have integrity , '' Wells said . The pressure in the well was measured Saturday morning at 6,745 pounds per square inch , rising only a couple of pounds per hour and nearing equilibrium . That pressure level is ambiguous . Scientists had hoped to see pressures above 7,500 psi , or even 8,000 or 9,000 , officials have said , because such high pressures , holding steady , would be clear evidence that the well casing is sound . If lower than about 6,000 psi , there could be little doubt that the casing has failed . The middle range has created two competing scenarios . One is that that there are leaks that have kept the well from pressurizing further . The other is that the reservoir is running out of gas -- and oil -- after gushing for so long . The protracted nature of the disaster could have partially depleted Macondo , which is the best-case scenario for the pressure test if not the prettiest picture in the broader sense . Wells said BP favors this second scenario because of the way the pressures rose steadily , fitting a model that 's consistent with a well that is n't damaged . No one has popped champagne or expressed any triumphalism . BP engineers and their associates from other oil companies helping out in the BP war room are unlikely to boast of success given the previous setbacks and the initial , fatal disaster itself , and the government will not be presenting the oil company any bouquets . The ultimate end will come , officials hope , when a relief well plugs Macondo with mud and then cement . The first of two relief wells is getting close and should intercept the well around the end of July , with the bottom-kill taking anywhere from a few days to a few weeks , Wells said .

Given last week 's initial progress in capping the well , I wo n't try to name a favorite in that race . But I would like to suggest a third , inanimate culprit : the cult of corporate social responsibility . As crude poured into the Gulf of Mexico and the world economy struggled to recover from the financial crisis , corporate social responsibility might seem a perverse target . Surely we need more corporate responsibility , not less . But many of the business disasters of the past 24 months have been facilitated by the mini-industry of corporate social responsibility -- known as CSR by those in the trade -- a fetish encouraged by the philanthropies that feed off it and funded by the corporate executives who have found that it serves their bottom line . Consider BP 's `` Beyond Petroleum '' campaign . Before the spill transformed that slogan into a punch line for late-night comedians , Madison Avenue had lauded BP 's effort to position itself as the greenest fossil fuel producer : `` Beyond Petroleum '' won two PRWeek `` campaign of the year '' awards and a gold `` Effie '' from the American Marketing Association . Ogilvy , the firm that invented the slogan , still boasts of `` Beyond Petroleum '' as a successful `` case study '' on its Web site . Or how about Goldman Sachs 's `` 10,000 Women '' project ? This initiative to organize and fund business education for 10,000 `` underserved '' women around the world is the limousine of CSR drives : smart , innovative and absolutely in tune with Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn 's `` Half the Sky '' zeitgeist . But the gulf oil spill and the financial crisis have taught us , rather brutally , that the heart of the relationship between business and society does n't lie with the charitable deeds that companies do in their off-hours but whether they are doing their day jobs in ways that help -- or hurt -- the rest of us . While BP was winning plaudits for being the first oil company to accept global warming as a scientific fact , the old-school Texas oilmen at ExxonMobil were unfashionably unapologetic about their core mission : to produce oil . Chastened by the Exxon Valdez disaster , however , they also became religious about safety standards . With hindsight , that attention to safety turns out to have had much greater social value than any number of creative CSR drives . The same story played out on Wall Street . So much of the wealth of the gilded early `` naughties '' trickled down into 10,000-women-style clever charitable initiatives that my friends Matthew Bishop and Michael Green were inspired to coin a term to describe the phenomenon : '' philanthro-capitalism . '' Yet the considerable social good done by those projects pales in comparison with the destruction wreaked by the made-on-Wall Street financial crisis of 2007-08 . The problem with CSR is that it muddies the waters . Goldman 's purpose is n't to educate women ; BP 's is n't to lead the green revolution . The job of business is to make money -- in BP 's case by producing energy , particularly fossil fuels ; in Goldman 's case through finance . Even the most cuddly , caring chief executive is ultimately charged with a selfish central mission : to generate profit for her shareholders . Forgetting that core goal -- which the CSR culture can tempt us to do -- is bad news for business leaders . It was a sad day for American capitalism this spring when Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein decided that it was politically unsafe to admit to Congress that he is very good at his job : in this instance , making the right bet on subprime mortgages . Even more deplorable was the moment a year earlier when President Obama used his bully pulpit to bully business -- in this instance , the Chrysler bondholders , whose only sin was to stand up for economic self-interest and that of their investors . But getting confused about the principal job of business is even more dangerous for the state . CSR , and the communitarian philosophy behind it , asks us to believe that the interests of an individual company and those of the wider community are fully aligned . They are n't -- a truth too many regulators forgot in recent years . Corporate social responsibility sounds as unobjectionable as motherhood and apple pie -- and it would indeed be crazy to object to rich companies writing big checks for good causes . But we should n't let that distract us from the fact that the chief social responsibility of business is to make a buck -- and the social responsibility of government is to be sure that perfectly proper corporate greed is channeled and constrained for the greater good of us all .

Just as The Federal Eye finalized his list of the winners and losers from the federal government 's response to the BP oil spill , oil once again started seeping near the capped well on Sunday . Though any discussion of potential winners and losers may come a bit early , the sense of hopelessness along the Gulf Coast is easing -- and Washington loves talking about who 's up and down . So with an appreciative nod to The Fix , let 's take a preliminary look at the agencies and officials winning and losing amid the government 's response to the disaster . -LRB- Your thoughts on who 's up and down are welcomed in the comments section below -RRB- : Thad Allen : He rescued the federal government 's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 took charge of the Obama administration 's spill response about a month before he was set to retire as Coast Guard commandant . Critics say he 's been too cautious and slow to respond to requests from BP and the Gulf Coast states and that he lacked total command of the government 's response . But the now-former admiral has provided transparent and steady leadership and has served as a nonpartisan , nonpolitical spokesman , a model leader for future disasters . U.S. Coast Guard : The nation 's maritime agency once again performed brilliantly , quickly responding to the April 20 explosion and leading the flotilla of ships collecting oil across the region . Few problems to speak of , save for a few critics and legislators who think its role should be expanded to ensure offshore drilling rigs are seaworthy . Steven Chu : The energy secretary earned two glowing profiles this weekend in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and both conclude that he 's provided steady , evidence-based advice and leadership to BP and the Obama administration , which have both praised his performance . It also does n't hurt that he 's a Nobel Prize winner -LRB- a point the administration loves to remind us about whenever it can -RRB- . The government 's online response : Hours after President Obama declared the oil spill a national incident , local , state and federal officials and BP stood up DeepwaterHorizonResponse.com , a comprehensive , one-stop shop for any and all information about the spill -- from potential health risks to how to file claims . Its simple design and frequent updates make it a model for how public and private entities can and should work together in the future to clearly inform the public about natural and manmade disasters . Minerals Management Service : The agency 's past scandals generated little national attention or interest until the spill made MMS a global embarrassment . Top agency bosses got the boot and new leadership renamed the agency the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement . Some officials initially called it BOE , but then insisted on BOEMRE . Or is it BOEM ? Either way , reporters still call it MMS and the name change provided more confusion and played into long-held criticisms that Washington too often slaps a new name and coat of paint on the same old problems . Ken Salazar and Tom Strickland : Salazar initially led the government 's public response to the oil spill , but several verbal gaffes -LRB- remember '' keep our boot on the neck of BP '' ? -RRB- led to White House repudiations and clarifications . Strickland earned criticism for staying on a whitewater rafting trip in the Grand Canyon instead of deploying to the Gulf . Now both have the unenviable task of reorganizing MMS\\/BOEMRE . Rep. Joe Barton : The Texas Republican 's public apology to BP for the White House 's treatment of the company fueled stereotypes that the GOP is too cozy with big business and big oil , diverted attention from the Obama administration 's stalled response to the spill , and gave Congressional Democrats a video clip they 'll play over and over and over again on their way to November 's elections . President Obama : Much of how he emerges from this incident depends on what happens with the next two unknowns -LRB- see below -RRB- . Kenneth Feinberg : Will his work as administrator of the BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster Victim Compensation Fund help or hurt his legacy as a the nation 's go-to guy on complicated legal matters ? The government 's work on approving and denying claims could cement the government 's reputation -- for better or worse -- in the Gulf Coast region for generations to come .

John Kerry -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- Agree or disagree with the list ? Are there others to add ?

Founder and CEO , Citizens for Affordable Energy and Fmr . Shell Oil President Monday , July 19 , 2010 ; 10:30 AM A day that seemed destined for success ended in ambiguity Sunday . The blown-out well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico remained shut for the fourth day , but the national incident commander reported concerns about seepage around the well and ordered BP to improve its monitoring of possible problems . Fairfax , Va. : Thad Allen has authorized keeping the well shut for another 24 hours provided that BP engineers monitor it carefully . What is going on now with the well ? How dangerous is the leakage ? Could it all explode all over again ? John Hofmeister : The biggest concern is the integrity of the well casing . It is an under designed well . The pressure and the explosive force of the original blowout could have damaged the well casing in one or more locations . Especially at the mouth of the reservoir . If oil is seeping on the outside of the casing because of the cap a lot or a little it can not be controlled by the cap , that may be the source of the current seepage . Santa Rosa Beach , Fla. : If it 's determined that there are leak -LRB- s -RRB- coming from the well casing -LRB- possibly causing the reported seepage , and\\/or other manifestations of a leak -RRB- , what 's the probability that the relief well -- if executed as planned -- will stem those leaks ? -LRB- I would think it depends on whether the leak -LRB- s -RRB- occur along the section of well casing between the relief well and the sea bed -RRB- .

Here , more than 15 miles offshore , a dredging company is building an island about as wide as an interstate highway . This sandy strip is slowly getting bigger , as dredged-up mud gurgles and creaks down its spine in a rusty pipe and shoots out to form new land at its end . But this island is still less than a mile long : a spot , not a wall , in a vast sea tainted by oil . Officially called Sand Berm E-4 , it is part of this state 's most ambitious plan to combat the oil and at the same time help stave off long-term coastal erosion . It is at the heart of a politically touchy spat between Louisiana and the federal government , and between Louisiana and some of its scientists , over how to fight the oil that has leaked from the Macondo well . Louisiana officials say the most reliable way to stop the oil from reaching sensitive marshes is to put solid land -- built from sandbags , sand piles or plain old rocks -- in its way . But many scientists and environmentalists say they are not convinced that these efforts will do much good . `` They are going to cost a lot of money , and their ultimate value is very much in question , '' said Aaron Viles , of the nonprofit Gulf Restoration Network . In some places , he said , the state 's land-building `` may be doing more harm than good . '' Louisiana is the closest land to the blown-out BP well , and its salt marshes are far harder to clean than the sandy beaches that dominate the coast in Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . Louisiana , led by Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- , has reacted with furious work to keep oil out of those marshes -- and with criticism of the Obama administration for holding its efforts up . State officials say they chose to build land barriers because they extend to the ocean floor , unlike the floating `` containment boom . '' They can also stay put in a storm , unlike the barges used to block marsh inlets . The state says the land-building plan will still be necessary , even if the BP well remains capped . There is already far too much oil in the water , Louisiana officials say , for skimming and controlled burns to eradicate it . `` There 's not enough assets in this world right now to skim this thing offshore , '' said Deano Bonano , an official in Jefferson Parish who is overseeing efforts to protect the parish 's marshes . `` You 're talking about an ocean of oil . '' The state has already filled in 14 inlets that connected the marshes with the Gulf of Mexico , using mounds of dirt and giant sandbags in metal frames . But this man-made island is part of a far more ambitious effort : The state has proposed building 128 miles of islands in arcs off the coast , based on existing plans to rebuild lost barrier islands to fight erosion .

When Can We GO BACK IN THE WATER ? '' they ask in a painting , staked on the side of the main road , that shows slivers of oil marring the ocean . `` Do n't Wish you were Here !! '' If you want to know how residents here feel about the oil spill , just read the signs that are posted on seemingly every electrical pole , planted in front yards or hung on the 10-foot stilts that keep houses off the ground in case of flooding .

How the hell are we suppose -LRB- sic -RRB- to feed our kids now ? '' Others strain for pointed puns , dubbing BP the `` Bayou Polluters . '' Water is the center of life in Grand Isle , an eight-mile scrap of land standing between Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico that has been hard hit by the oil spill that followed the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig nearly three months ago . BP has dispatched hordes of contractors to the island to clean up the beaches and skim oil off the waters , and the TV cameras have followed . The signs are the handiwork of a feisty population that feels there is little else they can do to keep their culture and industry alive . Many of them can not work because commercial fishing waters are closed , and they can not play because the beaches are lined with miles of orange tiger boom to keep the oil at bay . That means there is plenty of time to brainstorm new signs . `` I had to scream for help some kind of way , '' said Bobby Pitre , who crafted one of the most jarring displays . `` It was like an SOS to the world . '' Pitre created statues of a father and his little girl , cowering in fear , wearing oil-stained clothes and gas masks and holding a sign that says `` God save us all . '' He placed them in front of his tattoo parlor , Southern Sting , on a prominent corner on the long road to Grand Isle . Soon , folks were stopping to take photos . That inspired Pitre and his friend and co-worker , Eric Guidry , to paint murals along the front wall of the shop . They re-created the famous Obama `` hope '' poster and covered it with question marks and the words , `` What Now ? '' They painted a water tower that now holds oil . And for a final touch , they turned a mannequin into a bloody torso and attached it to a billboard : `` BP took our arms . The government is taking our legs . How will we stand ? '' Pitre said the sign is a reference to commercial fishing closures and the deepwater drilling moratorium that have decimated the local economy . `` Those are the two things we thrive off of , '' Pitre said . `` We really needed to get people 's attention . '' Perhaps this is just a region that wears its heart on its billboards . There are all manner of homemade signs along the winding state highways here , some fancier than others . One used blue spray paint on a white sign to warn drivers that `` U-turners will be shot at . '' Another roadside billboard features the graduation photo of a newly minted lawyer with congratulations from assorted family members . Meanwhile , one sign expresses underlying racial tensions in this majority white community : `` An illegal alien in Port Fouchon killed Nicholas , '' reads a sign in a front yard not far from Grand Isle . The jabs can also be directed inward . Several newer signs take aim at residents who have rented their homes -- they call them camps -- to BP contractors working on the cleanup .

Meanwhile , at a hearing in Louisiana , attorneys for crew members of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig did battle with one another and members of a government panel investigating the April 20 explosion while revealing new details about fateful choices made hours before the blowout . In Washington , the Interior Department moved to defuse tensions with shallow-water drilling firms and Gulf Coast lawmakers over how to speed up the permit process . BP said that one of the seepage areas , less than two miles from the Macondo well , is a natural leak not linked to the well . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander , said concerns are focused on other `` anomalies '' -- some seepage within several hundred yards of the well and bubbles appearing near the original blowout preventer on the sea floor . In addition , video provided by BP showed drops of oil and gas leaking from a piece of the new containment cap just below three rams designed to cut off the flow from the well . The leak has caused the formation of some hydrates -- slushlike crystals of natural gas and water that torpedoed earlier containment efforts . But , Allen said , `` we do not believe this is consequential at this time . '' Allen and , in another briefing , BP senior executive Kent Wells said the company might make a second attempt to kill the well by shooting drilling mud into the blowout preventer . An earlier attempt was aborted , but Wells said stopping the flow even temporarily would make killing the well easier . The latest events added to tension that had begun to dissipate over the weekend as the new containment cap appeared to be holding fast without causing problems . And the developments highlighted the unappealing tradeoffs associated with every decision carried out a mile below the sea surface . Allen said that the four-day-old effort to close the well had complicated the prospects of containing the spill by channeling oil through four lines to surface ships . He said that if the new cap must be opened , it would take several days to make sure sand would not clog the lines , to finish building flexible riser pipes to the surface and to hook up surface ships designed to suck oil from the cap . During that time , oil and gas would flow into the gulf . But with the cap closed , the risk of broader damage to the well itself and surrounding geological structures looms large . If the well is so damaged that oil and gas is leaking throughout , the hydrocarbons could seep into surrounding rock formations high above the reservoir and then into the sea . Or they could come out the top of the well . Vessels using seismic equipment were scouring the area for evidence of such seepage , but their presence kept other ships from getting close enough to finish building the infrastructure that would be needed if the cap were opened . Meanwhile , pressure in the well continued to rise Monday , albeit slowly , reaching 6,811 pounds per square inch , Allen said in the late afternoon . He said the pressure was rising about one pound per hour . This , too , has triggered debate among BP and U.S. officials , who had expected the pressure to hit 8,000 psi and who thought that lower pressure readings would be a sign that oil and gas was leaking into rock formations through damaged well equipment . But because of the steady increases in pressure , BP and government scientists are wondering whether so much oil and gas had been spilled already that the pressure in the partly depleted reservoir has been reduced . The fight to control the well was just one piece of the picture Monday . News , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

Ironically , he went to a training program on blowout preventers . Ronald Sepulvado , who had been working on the Deepwater Horizon for more than seven years , turned off his cellphone after he landed , stopped checking e-mail regularly and did not read an April 18 warning from contractor Halliburton that the well faced a potentially severe gas flow problem . The next news he received about the rig came in the wee hours of April 21 , when his son called him at a hotel and asked if he knew that the Deepwater Horizon was burning . Sepulvado gave that account Tuesday as the first of the BP well site leaders to testify before a government panel looking into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . Seated at the witness table in an airport hotel here , he recalled : -- Seeing an April 15 Halliburton report that said there was potential for a minor gas flow problem on the Deepwater rig . `` I just do n't read every line of that report because it 's about 20 to 30 pages long , '' Sepulvado said . He said he was not aware of any warning to the crew about a potential problem . -- Being present during an April audit that found that the rig 's blowout preventer was well past its required inspection date . He said he did n't know inspections were required every three to five years . -- Continuing to drill although the rig 's blowout preventer was having problems with certain valves and `` was leaking hydraulic fluid . '' Drilling at the Macondo well was not suspended because , Sepulvado said , `` we assumed that everything was okay . When the blowout preventer was put to the ultimate test April 20 , it failed catastrophically . Sepulvado said he has been a well site leader for 33 years . Today , he has a new assignment : helping to drill one of the relief wells to kill the Macondo . He spoke Tuesday at a hearing being conducted by a joint investigation board of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -LRB- an agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service -RRB- . The hearings have highlighted a history of delayed maintenance and mechanical problems aboard the Deepwater Horizon . While questioning Sepulvado , panel member Jason Mathews , of the agency , said a BP audit in September found a variety of problems , some of which had the potential to affect the rig 's emergency preparedness . He said `` a recommendation was made to the well team to suspend operations until many have been satisfactorily addressed . '' Two other BP company men -- who were alternating shifts as top BP representatives on the rig after Sepulvado left -- were scheduled to testify but withdrew . One was Robert Kaluza , who was less familiar with the Deepwater Horizon and who took over what was known as a troubled operation at a sensitive time . He invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination through his attorney . Donald Vidrine canceled for medical reasons , an explanation backed up with documents from his doctor , said Coast Guard Capt. Hung M. Nguyen , co-chairman of the investigating panel . BP and government officials moved closer Tuesday toward agreement on another technique for dealing with the well , which was capped last week . Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president , said the company would like to implement a `` static kill '' of the well , which involves sending mud and later cement into the well through the cap . The final closing would still have to be performed by a relief well `` bottom kill , '' now scheduled to begin in late July or early August if the weather remains good . Wells said the company is eager to perform the static kill if the government approves it . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander , said he expected to have a final decision Wednesday . While the operation could speed the final closing of the well -- an important consideration during the gulf 's hurricane season -- it would also leave forever unanswered the question of how much oil has gushed out of the well . The amount of oil that escaped will play a role in determining the dollar amount the company will have to pay the government and others .

Send him an e-mail Here 's another economic ripple from the BP oil spill . The oil company has been `` offering signing bonuses and lucrative pay to prominent scientists from public universities around the Gulf Coast '' to muster a defense against inevitable litigation in the wake of the April 20 oil spill , according to a report in the Press-Register newspaper in Alabama . At one point , BP plc `` attempted to hire the entire marine sciences department '' at the University of South Alabama , the report states . The contract , obtained by the newspaper , would have barred the scientists from publishing their research , sharing it with other scholars or even talking about it . The department did not sign . `` We did n't like the perception of the university representing BP in any fashion , '' Bob Shipp , the department head , told the Press-Register . As previously reported in The Post and elsewhere , the spill has prompted a mountain of litigation . Eleven workers died in the initial explosion , and the toll on the Gulf Coast , its economy and environment almost defies calculation . Scientists interviewed by the newspaper told of being offered $ 250 an hour . The report stated that scientists from Louisiana State University , the University of Southern Mississippi and Texas A&M have accepted offers . Universities typically allow faculty to take on some amount of consulting work . According to the Press-Register , BP has reached out to a wide range of scientists who study invertebrates , plankton , marsh environments , oceanography and sharks . By Daniel de Vise | July 21 , 2010 ; 11:00 AM ET The calculation of the annual revenue is incorrect : $ 104K is 52 weeks at $ 2K , so it seems that the writer multiplied $ 250 an hour by 8 hours ... but forgot to multiply by 5 days in a week . Full employment -LRB- 5 days a week for the whole year -RRB- at the stated rate would mean $ 520,000 a year . On the other hand , academics will probably work only only 30-40 weeks a year , and only part-time . So the real number might be in the $ 200-300K range . This error makes me wonder if the rest of the article is accurate . While I would not put it past BP to try to arrange something like this , I think there would be more important or prestigious institutions than the University of South Alabama that BP would try to leverage in that manner ! Or is someone from that university desperately trying to make themselves look important ? `` Look , we 're such experts in this field that BP tried to bribe us to carry their torch ! '' I think this needs to be corroborated by more than hearsay ... and faulty calculations .

And it 's a bit like finding Waldo in the famous game . The Gawker Web site said it received a tip about a BP photo taken from inside a helicopter , that shows a panorama of vessels working on the sea surface near the damaged well . The view through the windows makes it appear as though the helicopter is in the air . But the astute tipster noticed a small glimpse of a control tower in a corner of the photograph . A poor Photoshop job left some white space around the shoulder of one of the pilots next to a patch of sea that was a brighter shade of blue than other parts of the gulf . In addition , zooming in on the helicopter 's gauges reveals that the helicopter is not in the air at all ; the dashboard indicates that the door and ramp are open and the parking brake engaged , Gawker noted . The pilot appears to be holding a pre-flight checklist . BP spokesman Scott Dean sent The Post the original photograph . The Waldos do n't jump out at you . The helicopter was actually on the deck of a vessel at the spill site so the panorama of ships in the distance was there in the original photo . But the photographer , who is working on contract to BP , pasted in blue sea where the edge of the landing pad was showing . He also adjusted colors and contrast so that the interior of the helicopter was brighter , Dean said . While the changes were minor , the embarrassment was major , coming at a time when the oil giant is trying to convince the American public that it is being open and transparent about the oil spill . The helicopter photo is the third doctored BP image outed by bloggers this week . Earlier , Americablog.com noticed that BP had altered an image of its crisis response center in Houston . The company 's photographer had clumsily filled in blank spaces on a wall of subsea video feeds with images taken by some of the remotely operated vehicles . It is normal for some of those ROVs to be idle and to have some blank feeds . Americablog also exposed an altered image from the Houston office , showing a technical team in front of a large projection screen . The image on the projection screen had been enhanced using Photoshop . BP 's Dean also provided the original of that photo to The Post . In the original , the screen appears to be entirely white because of the light contrast with the rest of the room . Dean said that the photographer used `` the color saturation tool '' to show `` a clearer version of the same image on the projection screen . '' Dean said that the altered helicopter and headquarters photographs , like the doctored one of the Houston control room , would be promptly taken down from the BP Web site .

The sale takes BP most of the way toward its goal of raising $ 10 billion over the next year by selling exploration and production assets . Those asset sales would cover half of the $ 20 billion BP has pledged to put in an escrow fund to cover claims resulting from the spill . The deal includes oil and gas reserves in Texas and southeastern New Mexico , natural gas reserves in western Canada , and the Western Desert business concessions and East Badr El-din exploration concession in Egypt . `` It is a win-win situation . BP is a motivated seller , and Apache is an opportunist . Both are happy with the deal , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. . Gheit said the transaction involved `` marginal assets for BP but core business areas for Apache . '' He said Apache paid `` reasonable prices '' of $ 18 per barrel of proven reserves of oil or the natural gas equivalent . `` I think Apache got a fair deal , '' said Pavel Molchanov , an oil analyst at Raymond James . `` But it is not a fire-sale price . Far from it . '' BP shares had fallen 1.5 percent to close at $ 35.20 before the announcement but recovered most of that ground in after-hours trading . This is the fourth deal between the two companies in the past six years , Gheit said . Apache said it would acquire the equivalent of 385 million barrels of oil reserves , which Molchanov said was about 2 percent of BP 's proven reserves . The properties currently produce 28,000 barrels of oil and 331 million cubic feet of gas a day . The purchase price includes $ 3.1 billion for 10 areas in West Texas 's Permian Basin , an oil and gas region where Apache already has substantial production . G. Steven Farris , Apache 's chief executive , said in a statement that they were `` under-exploited assets . '' The package also includes $ 3.25 billion for gas and unconventional gas properties in western Canada . The rest covers concessions for exploration and some infrastructure in Egypt . BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in a statement that `` over the last two months the Board has considered BP 's options for generating the cash necessary to meet the obligations likely to arise from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . '' He said that the company sought `` to divest assets which are strategically more valuable to other parties than they are to BP . '' Apache 's Farris said that `` this is a rare opportunity to acquire legacy positions from a major oil company . '' He added : `` We seldom have an opportunity like this in one of our core areas , let alone three . '' The deal did not include a share of BP 's Alaska holdings , which sources close to the company said might be sold . A failure to reach agreement on Alaska might explain why the package fell short of the $ 10 billion to $ 12 billion figure that had been widely reported .

Exxon Mobil will lead the engineering and construction efforts , which the companies said they hoped to complete in 18 months . The new response plan focuses on how to quickly stop the flow of oil from a leaking subsea well and how to channel the oil to vessels nearby . It does not include new measures for how to skim oil from water or to clean soiled shorelines . The group of companies said that the plan will include a containment cap similar to the one now on top of BP 's damaged Macondo well . It will also include specially designed subsea manifolds , flexible riser pipes to link a damaged well to the water surface , and ships capable of capturing and storing the oil . The companies said that `` dedicated crews '' will ensure regular maintenance , inspection and readiness of the equipment . The plan comes as Congress is mulling new requirements for deepwater offshore drilling , which has been halted by an Obama administration six-month moratorium . The House Wednesday passed two bills that would push for better oil spill response and safety technologies . The joint response plan is in part a response to recent hearings of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , whose members harshly criticized the major oil companies for having nearly identical oil spill response plans . Some of the plans included boilerplate about walruses that are not found in the gulf and a contact number of a dead marine expert . All the plans claimed to be able to handle spills much larger than the one BP has been wrestling with . At the time , chief executives from the oil giants admitted the plans were `` an embarrassment . '' `` As an industry , we must rebuild trust with the American people in order to demonstrate that we can produce energy in a safe and environmentally responsible manner , '' Marvin Odum , president of Shell Oil , the U.S. affiliate of Royal Dutch , said in a statement . `` Beyond Shell 's absolute commitment to oil spill prevention and robust well designs , additional safeguards must be strengthened across the industry to develop the capacity to quickly respond and resolve a deepwater well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , regardless of how unlikely it is that this situation will reoccur . '' The plan got a mixed review with one key lawmaker . `` This is only one possible tool in what must be a more robust tool kit for oil companies to respond to spills , '' said Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D.-Mass -RRB- , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 's subcommittee on energy and environment . `` This could be a positive step , but it can not be the industry 's last . '' `` While this proposal 's response time could be quicker than this spill , the proposal these companies are submitting is essentially the current BP cap system and plan for 100 percent collection of oil , '' Markey added . `` This current , ad hoc system erected by BP can not and should not be the final proposal by these companies . While this could be a rapidly-deployed system , the oil companies must do better than BP 's current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint . The oil companies must also invest more in technologies that will prevent fatal blowouts in the first place . '' The companies said that they plan to construct equipment that would be `` flexible , adaptable and able to be deployed within days on a wide range of well designs and equipment , oil and natural gas flow rates and weather conditions . '' They said the system would be designed to work in depths up to 10,000 feet and to contain up to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons -RRB- a day . Clarence P. Cazalot , chief executive of Marathon Oil , was part of an American Petroleum Institute group in Washington this week to urge lawmakers to refrain from setting too many rules for offshore drilling . He said the industry would `` engineer , design , build '' a sealing cap for underwater wells . He said the goal would be `` to be able to plan in advance and to have this equipment on standby to deploy not just in the gulf but anywhere in the world .

Company senior vice president Kent Wells said that while boats and crew remain at the Macondo site , work on the relief well was stopped in the morning and evolving plans for an additional effort to seal the well from above were put on hold . `` We could have a tropical storm at Macondo , '' Wells said , `` and we have to be able to get out of the way . We have to watch the weather very , very carefully and adjust plans accordingly . '' The plug was installed about 300 feet below the sea floor , beneath the blowout preventer of the relief well . Forecasters predict the storm system will most likely move into the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend , although in a weakened condition . Right now , it has a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical depression or storm within the next 48 hours . If it does head towards the Gulf Coast , the long-feared possibility arises of increased oil pollution ashore and in the marshes . The Shell Oil Company announced Wednesday that it was preparing to take all non-essential personnel off its platforms and rigs in the eastern Gulf as a precaution . Spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh said the move was triggered by the possibility of bad weather rather than any clear threat . BP spokesman Daren Bodo said his company was watching the weather but had not yet decided on any evacuation . If the weather forces workers to leave the leak site , the final sealing of the well could be delayed 10 to 14 days , National Incident Commander Thad Allen said Wednesday . Since a new containment cap was installed last week , the well has been plugged and the oil and gas geyser controlled . BP officials said they were confident the well as currently configured would hold up during a storm . Earlier in the day , Allen also said that efforts to collect oil from the water surface appear to be successful . `` We 're really having to search for the oil in some cases , '' he said . `` We 've had skimmers out there on the wellhead site for a number of days now , as many as 50 a day .

Michael Williams , a former Marine who survived the April 20 inferno by jumping from the burning rig , told a federal panel probing the disaster that other critical systems had been functioning unreliably in the run-up to the blowout . Williams told the panel that he understood that the rig had been operating with the gas alarm system in `` inhibited '' mode for a year to prevent false alarms from disturbing the crew . Williams said that when he discovered that the alarm system was inhibited , he reported it to supervisors . He said they informed him that orders were to keep it that way . If the safety system was disabled , it would not have been unusual . Records of federal enforcement actions reviewed by The Washington Post show that , in case after case , rig operators paid fines for allegedly bypassing safety systems that could impede routine operations . The Deepwater Horizon was owned by Transocean , which employs Williams , and was operating under contract to BP . Transocean said in a statement that the rig 's general alarm system was controlled by a person on the bridge `` to prevent the general alarm from sounding unnecessarily . '' Transocean provided statements taken from crew members saying they heard alarms , and it also released part of an April inspection report that found `` no -LRB- gas -RRB- detectors either in fault or inhibited condition , other than units being serviced . '' Williams testified that a computer used to monitor and control drilling operations intermittently froze -- a problem that became known as `` the blue screen of death . '' Despite attempted repairs , the issue remained unresolved at the time of the blowout , he said . Earlier in the drilling operation , one of the panels that controlled the blowout preventer -- the last line of defense against a gusher -- had been placed in bypass mode to work around a malfunction , Williams said . He said a colleague told him that an inspection of the rig in the spring , shortly before the disaster , found extensive maintenance problems . The colleague said `` that we were going to be in the shipyard a lot longer than anticipated because the rig was in very bad condition , '' Williams testified . The Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , until recently called the Minerals Management Service , are conducting the hearing . Testimony continued before the panel Friday even as the leftovers of Tropical Storm Bonnie blew toward the spill site .

The decision to begin the evacuation was made late Thursday by retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander , after concluding that Tropical Storm Bonnie would likely hit the site with winds above 40 mph on Saturday morning . A tropical storm watch was issued early Friday for the northern Gulf Coast from Destin , Fla. , to Morgan City , La. , the Associated Press reported . `` Due to the risk that Tropical Storm Bonnie poses to the safety of the nearly 2,000 people responding to the BP oil spill at the well site , many of the vessels and rigs will be preparing to move out of harm 's way beginning tonight , '' Allen said in a statement . `` This includes the rig drilling the relief well that will ultimately kill the well , as well as other vessels needed for containment . Some of the vessels may be able to remain on site , but we will err on the side of safety . '' Allen and BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said that the containment cap placed on the well last week is sufficiently secure that it can ride out a tropical storm without leaking or compromising the now-controlled well . Because both the blown-out well and the two relief wells being drilled nearby are connected in various ways to boats on the surface , BP 's first task has been to begin disconnecting them and taking the precautions it can . `` We 've already been preparing for several days , '' Wells said before the final decision was made to evacuate . BP officials said that the vessels would move out of harm 's way but would not return to port . Vessels will be moved out according to their ability to withstand the conditions . Wells said that if the forecast changes before all the boats leave , crews could begin to work again more quickly . But a full evacuation would mean 10 to 12 days of lost time at the site . The coming storm may well push oil into the fragile marshlands of Louisiana , and potentially could be more damaging than Tropical Storm Alex , which had that effect last month . Alex was hundreds of miles away from the well site and the Louisiana coast but it created waves large and strong enough to carry the oily water to formerly unaffected areas . Reflecting the growing concern about Bonnie , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday ; the storm is forecast to hit Louisiana on Sunday . Jindal announced the action at a news conference in Baton Rouge just before U.S. forecasters determined it was a tropical storm strong enough to get a name .

The slick , near the oil port of Dalian , in Liaoning province , was caused when two pipelines exploded last Friday as crude was being unloaded from a Libyan tanker . Government officials said the accident released about 1,500 tons -- or 400,000 gallons -- of oil into the Yellow Sea , where the slick now covers up to 170 square miles , according to news reports , making it China 's largest recorded spill . The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is estimated in the tens of millions of gallons . `` I used small wood planks to scoop up the oil and put it into big plastic garbage bags , '' said Liu Jia , a worker at the Dalian beach resort . `` Some of my colleagues used chopsticks ... It works , because the oil is quite sticky . Sometimes , we just used our hands to pick up the sand that is covered with oil . '' Liu described the methods being used as `` quite primitive , quite time-consuming . '' China National Petroleum Corp. said Thursday that no more oil was leaking from the damaged pipelines , but the port at Dalian remained closed as the black oil continued to wash up onshore . Fishing has been banned in the vicinity at least through August , and several nearby beaches were also declared off-limits at the height of the summer tourist season . `` It should be the best season for the beach right now , '' said Bao Wulan , head of public relations for the Dalian Golden Beach Tourism Group . She said that 70,000 to 80,000 visitors would normally be in the area this time of year -- `` but now , no tourists . '' She added : `` I do n't know how our business can go back to normal . Our beach is almost all polluted . '' The environmental group Greenpeace China said it has found oil in bays six miles from Dalian , and Jinshitan Golden Beach , more than 20 miles away , was also reportedly affected . Workers were laying straw mats at Jinshitan on Thursday in a bid to suck up the crude . Greenpeace said 10,000 shellfish farms have been contaminated .

Many policymakers think that the record before the BP oil spill was exemplary . In a House hearing Thursday , Rep. John J. `` Jimmy '' Duncan Jr. -LRB- R-Tenn . -RRB- said , `` It 's almost an astonishingly safe , clean history that we have there in the gulf . '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the industry 's `` history of safety over all of those times '' had provided the `` empirical foundation '' for U.S. policy . But federal records tell a different story . They show a steady stream of oil spills dumping 517,847 barrels of petroleum -- which would fill an equivalent number of standard American bathtubs -- into the Gulf of Mexico between 1964 and 2009 . The spills killed thousands of birds and soiled beaches as far away as Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . Altogether , they poured twice as much as oil into U.S. waters as the Exxon Valdez tanker did when it ran aground in 1989 . The industry 's record had been improving before the BP spill . In 2009 , the largest one was about 1,500 barrels , about what BP 's damaged well was leaking every hour before it was capped last week . But at least a handful of spills take place annually as a result of blowouts , hurricanes , lax pipeline maintenance , tanker leaks and human error , according to figures kept by the Minerals Management Service , now known as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement . Moreover , in at least one key instance , the official statistics understate the actual quantities of oil that have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico . MMS statistics say that a 1970 blowout on a Shell Oil well that killed four people triggered a spill of 53,000 barrels . But Robert Bea , a University of California , Berkeley professor who at that time worked for Shell tracking the oil spill , says that the spill was 10 times that size and contaminated shorelines on the Yucatan Peninsula as well as the U.S. Gulf Coast . `` I see the numbers , and I shrug my shoulders , '' said Bea , who contributed to a report issued last week on the April 20 Deepwater Horizon accident . The 1970 Shell blowout happened on a production platform , he notes . `` We knew what the production rates were , '' he said . Today regulators rely heavily on company estimates , although some environmentalists fear that the spill size might be underestimated . The industry 's track record is a crucial issue . On March 31 , President Obama cited advances in offshore drilling technology as a key reason for his willingness to open up new offshore areas to exploration and production . Now , the oil and gas industry is trying to use its earlier record to persuade Obama to lift a temporary moratorium and to convince the public that companies can continue offshore drilling without a similar incident . `` The oil industry has drilled 42,000 wells in the Gulf of Mexico , and this is the first time an incident of this magnitude has happened , '' said the American Petroleum Institute 's president , Jack Gerard , who has been urging Congress to avoid imposing tough new regulations . The BP oil spill is the biggest ever , but MMS records tell a more complicated story . Performance had been improving but from a poor baseline .

Or so it seems . After it had finally stanched the flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico last week , this week brought news that the `` cap '' it placed on the gushing wellhead might be producing `` seepage '' elsewhere on the sea floor . From triumph to tribulation , over the course of a mere weekend . BP 's long PR nightmare continues . But it is far from alone . If public relations is what companies do to spread the good news about their successes , then PR 's evil twin , crisis PR , is what companies do to contain the bad . It 's the realm of the total meltdown -- the grim concatenation of all things gone to hell . Until recently , it was seen as an indispensable aspect of business communications , a sort of black magic worth millions . But now , BP has a well-connected PR firm in Washington , the Brunswick Group , on the job . A veritable deluge of crises since 2008 has shown that crisis PR is no longer up to the job . The BP oil spill , Apple 's Antennagate , the fall of Goldman Sachs , Toyota 's Great Recall , the sexual travails of Tiger Woods , the trysts of Al Gore , the loose lips of Gen. Stanley McChrystal -- all these combustions would have been fixed , in the good old days of 2007 , with a call to Burston-Marsteller or Sitrick and Co. . The accepted wisdom was that you did n't want to be on the other side of a Mike Sitrick counterattack . Crisis PR was n't just effective , it was feared . But the new crisis paradigm is spinning hopelessly in the dark . By mid-2010 , the stories were changing too rapidly to control , much less to revise . Like a violent postmodern vortex , the bad news sucked down all who struggled to escape it . Unsurprisingly , the Internet is to blame . But the phenomenon goes beyond the 24\\/7 news-and-comment cycle . It forces the PR world to confront something far more disruptive -- and something that will undercut its $ 700-an-hour fees . The lesson now for companies that screw up is that you really have no chance : The currents are against you from the get-go . The courts of Twitter and online video sites , along with Facebook groups that deplore the transgressions , will overwhelm even the most elaborate crisis battle plan . The profession , quite simply , is at a crossroads . And it is n't in a position to ride out the bumps , because it 's up against the kind of high-altitude turbulence that can shred the airframe . The gulf spill and its impact on BP is Exhibit A. The Deepwater Horizon blowout and subsequent gusher caught the firm unprepared . `` BP might have to change its name , '' says Ira Kalb , a professor of merketing at USC 's Marshall School of Business . `` Crisis PR can still work if it 's executed properly , but in this case BP could n't limit the scope of the damage because they did n't know the solution . '' Other companies that have been clobbered by their inability to limit the damage can console themselves that they wo n't have to change their corporate identities , though this may be cold comfort , given the savaging of their brands . After its recall of millions of vehicles for sudden , unintended acceleration this year , Toyota has had to reevaluate its core values . A tsunami of outrage did n't just catch the company off-guard -- it flummoxed Toyota 's entire corporate culture . The vaunted `` Toyota Way '' could n't absorb the punishment meted out by millions of critics with access to keyboards . By the time chief executive Akio Toyoda was hauled before Congress , Toyota was just hoping to cut its losses . At one point , crisis PR was all about aggression -- and to its -LRB- ahem -RRB- credit , Toyota did attack researchers who maintained that they had been able to duplicate the unintended acceleration under lab conditions . But it was fighting while in retreat , and defense is n't crisis PR 's specialty . For PR firms , the key is to get back to focusing on trust . `` One you 've lost trust , you 've lost just about everything , '' Kalb says . `` You ca n't put spin on it . You 're dead if the public thinks you 're spinning . '' Kalb stresses that it 's important for companies caught in the crisis spiral to propose solutions . Inside the profession , however , distributing blame has been more popular . Various crisis PR pros were so appalled by how Woods 's handlers mishandled the scandal that they offered superior strategies , aimed at preventing the Striped One from losing his corporate endorsements . This kind of perspective is n't even too little , too late . It 's blind to the new reality . The meltdown of the most aggressive form of PR comes at a time when the profession has arguably never been more influential . The Economist has argued as much . As the advertising landscape has fragmented in the age of digital media , PR has come to be perceived as a cheap and effective way of reaching customers who TiVo 'd away the timeworn 30-second TV spot . This was a moment of triumph for public relations , which ad-agency creative types have always treated with contempt . Unfortunately , the forces that enabled PR to gain some respect -- the Internet and social media -- are the same forces that have placed its crisis counterpart at a profound disadvantage . `` Social networking has made -LRB- the situation -RRB- much more difficult , '' Kalb says . He argues that PR firms are going to have to bring social media -- the relentless Twitter feeds , the spontaneous brand hatred that can explode on Facebook , the viral YouTube parodies -- into their services . This could end up making crisis PR much less about seducing journalists and advising clients to engage in mea culpas and more about maintaining numerous online angles of attack on the Big Bad Story . The upshot is that crisis PR will be far less feared , but much more effective . That which almost killed it can make it stronger .

' '' Panama City Beach 's digital campaign is just one example of how Panhandle communities are deploying new strategies to lure back tourists who have steered away from the Gulf Coast after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion . In Florida 's $ 60 billion tourism industry , the Panhandle stands to lose a substantial amount in tourism dollars . From Panama City to Pensacola , merchants report business being down by 30 to 50 percent on any given week . Though BP has given the state a $ 25 million block grant to promote area beaches , local business owners say it 's going to take more personal touches than 15-second TV and radio spots to lure back leery tourists . `` We know it 's hard to drown out all the negative images people are seeing , '' said Nathan Holler , owner of the Dog House Deli in Pensacola Beach . Looking to thank tourists and locals who have stuck it out on Pensacola Beach , Holler and four other beach-shop owners joined forces to organize a weekly pot-luck style jamboree on the beach . On a recent balmy night , about 30 locals and tourists mingled on the beach , drinking beers donated by the liquor store across the street , and taking paddleboard lessons donated by the local watersports shop . In Destin , hotel and restaurant employees don `` Thank You '' buttons and rarely miss an opportunity to give a hearty `` thanks for choosing Destin '' greeting to those spending money on the beach . It 's part of a gratitude campaign launched by the local chamber of commerce . The appreciation campaign is mirrored in Panama City Beach , where businesses have pooled resources so that everyone from hotel employees to community leaders can randomly dole out $ 25 gift certificates to visitors . But even now , as oil remains about 100 miles west of Pensacola and large stretches of tar-stained beaches have been cleaned , many hotels and restaurants remain largely empty during this peak season . `` Even if the beach has been cleaned up , that 's not the image they play on the news , '' said Peter King , a board member of the Perdido Key Area Chamber of Commerce . `` They show footage from a couple of weeks ago , or people see the pictures coming out of Louisiana and think that 's us , '' King said . `` That leads to a big misconception about the condition of our beaches . That 's why it 's important for us to try to get people out here , so they can see it for themselves .

They are just thin green stalks , sticking out of grass too wet to stand on . They are cordgrass and wiregrass , common species that wave in the winds in south Louisiana 's coastal marshes . Except , in some places , they are n't waving anymore : Where oil has sloshed into the marshes , their stalks are matted and gooey and on their way to death . What happens next -- whether these two grasses rebound or vanish -- will be a very important piece of the gulf 's larger environmental story . Now that the well has been capped , the next question is whether marsh and marine ecosystems can shrug off the oil 's damage , or whether it will leave them with lasting wounds . `` Many of us are much more worried about the marsh than we are about fish and shrimp and all that , '' said Denise Reed , a wetlands expert at the University of New Orleans . `` If those plants die , they do n't come back . And the marsh is gone . '' Louisiana 's coastal marshes are vital to ecosystems that extend far into deep , open water : They shelter `` juvenile '' shrimp , crabs and fish until these creatures are large enough to venture into open water . For these places , marsh grasses are as vital as water . Their roots hold the land together , giving support to loose , wet sediment that would otherwise erode . `` They are the marsh , basically , '' said Andy Nyman of Louisiana State University . `` Once they die ... it just floats away . '' Humans , too , depend on the grasses , since the marshes are a natural barrier against storm surges headed toward New Orleans . Already , there are about 200 square miles of oiled coastline in Louisiana alone , said Robert Barham , secretary of the state 's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . He said most of that is marshland , which means around 5 percent of the state 's 3,900 square miles of marsh is oily . That number may not seem overwhelming , but Louisiana is already losing 24 square miles of wetlands to erosion every year . Scientists say the state can not afford to lose another large chunk all at once . The question now is : How much will die ? Humans will play some role in determining the answer . On a recent boat ride through the marshes south of Cocodrie , La. , some workers could be seen trying the delicate approach to marsh cleaning , using a long stick with a plastic mop on the end to dab oil out of grass . Some could be seen trying another approach . One crew was throwing white absorbent `` boom '' down onto a heavily oiled patch , then stomping it down to sop up the oil . There were also reports of damage from the boom itself , driven in by the most recent storm . Scientists say that it is hard to get all the oil out of an oiled patch , and that trying too aggressively could just mash oil deeper into the plants ' roots .

It is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 . Research on gulf oil spill should n't take a backseat to litigation The Gulf of Mexico has been inundated with the equivalent of more than an Exxon Valdez-size spill each week -- threatening the health of the marine environment , the public and the livelihoods of gulf residents . From the first day of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , Gulf Coast residents have wanted to know how much oil was spilling ; where it was coming from and where it was going ; what effects the oil would have on coastal ecosystems and how fast they would recover ; and how this tragic event was going to affect their health , their jobs and their communities . Unfortunately , the government , BP and scientists were not prepared to answer those questions . Three months later , we still have more questions than answers . The major federal scientific response to date has been focused on the Natural Resources Damages Assessment -LRB- NRDA -RRB- process prescribed by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , as the government begins to build its case against BP to ensure that the nation is reimbursed for the immense damage done to the environment . It has also been widely reported that BP has been engaging academic scientists for its NRDA defense . Billions of dollars are at stake , so litigation is likely to go on for years . Because the NRDA is an adversarial process , both sides will seek to use science in a legal context , with the administration attempting to maximize financial damages and BP trying to minimize them . Much of the information obtained from research and monitoring will be tied up in the courts rather than being made publicly available and scrutinized . The broader scientific community will be unable to use much of this information to understand the ongoing effects of the oil and dispersants , or to help our nation 's policymakers better prepare for future accidents . Early on , there was hope for development of a comprehensive science plan that would enable the nation to learn from this disaster and better understand the effects of oil spills on the marine environment and coastal communities . The aim was to integrate the efforts of federal agencies with academic research capacities . An initial effort to provide support for such a plan was spearheaded by BP , which announced in May that it would launch a 10-year , $ 500 million research initiative based on a peer-reviewed process separate from the NRDA process . Results from research funded by this initiative were to be made available to the public and subject to peer review . We hoped that this research would be based in part on recommendations that resulted from a symposium convened at Louisiana State University in June , when more than 200 researchers from across the nation discussed the scientific needs for understanding the ecological impact -- such as the spill 's toxicity and effect on the food chain -- and other consequences of oil , gas and dispersant contamination . While $ 30 million was allocated , the BP research initiative is unfortunately on hold . More than six weeks ago , the White House requested that the company work closely with Gulf Coast governors and state and local environmental and health authorities to determine the next steps for this initiative . A decision has yet to be reached . Our nation needs a comprehensive science plan to learn from and respond better to this tragedy . Those working in academia , federal and state government , nongovernmental organizations , and industry need to be consulted and included . The federal government must also make funding available , apart from the NRDA process , to enable independent , peer-reviewed science to be undertaken . We need these things now . Every day of delay means more valuable data is not being collected , and ultimately lost . After the Exxon Valdez spill , it took more than three years for a research initiative to come to fruition , a terrible loss of scientific opportunity and information critical to planning and implementing better responses to future spills . President Obama signed an executive order last week establishing a national policy for the stewardship of the oceans , coasts and Great Lakes . The White House needs to express similar leadership when it comes to the gulf region 's marine environment and the research necessary to understand it with respect to the spill . We hope this can still be a `` teachable moment '' and not another lost opportunity . Robert B.

A portion of that could be refunded from taxes BP paid in earlier years . The company disclosed its intentions as part of its second-quarter earnings report , in which it said it would record a $ 32.2 billion charge to reflect the costs of the spill . Under U.S. corporate tax law , companies can take credits on up to 35 percent of their losses . The credit for BP could mean , however , that taxpayers will indirectly foot part of the bill for the $ 20 billion fund that BP established to compensate people and businesses harmed by the disaster . On Tuesday , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said U.S. taxpayers would not be responsible for the cost of the spill . When asked whether BP should be claiming a credit , Gibbs said , `` I do n't think anybody would prefer that they do that . '' Gibbs would not say whether the president would press BP on the tax deduction . He said , though , that `` there are tax laws in this country that have been written for quite some time . '' Lawmakers called for BP to renounce any claim for a refund . `` I call on BP to show , for once , a glimmer of humanity in this situation and halt its claim for this tax break immediately , '' said Rep. Eliot L. Engel -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- . Policymakers crafted the tax code this way so that companies can spread their profits and losses over more than just one calendar year . Let 's say a company makes $ 100 billion one year and pays the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent , or $ 35 billion . The next year , the economy goes south , and the company loses $ 100 billion . Over those two years , the company made nothing but still paid $ 35 billion in taxes . From the tax code 's perspective , the company overpaid in previous years . To rectify this , companies can claim a credit , also at the 35 percent rate . Companies can seek a refund for taxes paid from the previous two years or , if there 's money leftover , carry the credit forward up to 20 years . `` What they 're trying to do is take the arbitrariness of what you did this particular year over the life of the company , or over a long period of the life of the company , '' said Douglas Shackelford , a tax professor at the University of North Carolina . It 's how a company such as General Electric , which reported $ 408 million in losses at its U.S. operations last year , not only paid nothing in U.S. corporate income taxes last year but also received a refund . Robert Willens , a corporate tax expert , said it 's unlikely that BP will give up its tax credit , even if faced with public opposition . The company voluntarily established the $ 20 billion escrow account for victims of the spill and never promised the government that it would not seek any deductions associated with the spill , he said . This month , Goldman Sachs promised not to ask for tax credits associated with the $ 535 million it paid in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle a fraud charge . But as Willens says , that was specifically negotiated in Goldman 's agreement with the SEC . `` The cost associated with the cleanup and the damage and all that -- that 's just another cost of doing business from the tax perspective , '' Shackelford said . `` It 's viewed no different from paying salaries or other costs they might incur .

BP 's board is expected to announce early Tuesday that it has picked Dudley , who grew up in Hattiesburg , Miss. , and later spent eight years working in Russia , to become the company 's chief executive , cutting short the turbulent tenure of British geologist Tony Hayward , who has been caught in the vortex of U.S. public anger over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The choice of the even-keeled Dudley , who would become the first American to run the company formerly known as British Petroleum , would represent a fresh start for a firm that has been soiled by the massive oil spill . `` It turns a new page , and it starts to look to the future , '' said Daniel Yergin , chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates . `` I think Bob has both the technical competence and a broad view of the industry and where it fits into the world . '' The mere prospect of Dudley becoming BP 's chief executive marks a cultural shift for a corporate goliath that suffered from identity issues ever since it acquired three big U.S. oil firms -- Amoco , Arco and Sohio -- more than a decade ago . Although British BP chiefs had shuttled back and forth by plane from their St. James Square headquarters in London to their U.S. empire , the cultural gulf proved too big . And after the April 20 drilling rig explosion killed 11 workers and set off the largest oil spill in U.S. history , Hayward struck several wrong notes with an angry American public . On Monday , Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum -LRB- R -RRB- said that throughout the spill , Hayward `` has appeared disingenuous , disinterested , and often dismissive of what our state , our businesses and our residents are suffering . '' In some ways , picking Dudley is like reaching back to the past to move into the future . He worked for Amoco -LRB- formerly known as Standard Oil Co. of Indiana -RRB- for nearly 20 years in the United States , Britain and Russia . When BP bought the company in 1998 , Dudley , then Amoco 's general manager for strategy , made the leap to BP . His U.S. background might prove an asset both to him and the company . Forty percent of BP 's shareholders live in the United States , and BP is the largest producer of oil in the United States . With Congress contemplating a ban on BP operating on federal lands , and with the Justice Department weighing criminal charges in connection with the rig blowout , Dudley 's background and temperament could help BP navigate U.S. political waters and protect the company 's ability to do business here . `` BP has two vulnerabilities , political and legal , '' said Robin West , chairman of PFC Energy , a Washington consulting firm . `` The political vulnerability is that Congress wants to punish BP . '' Dudley also has experience around the world . While at Amoco , he negotiated projects in the South China Sea and in Russia . At BP , he fit in well . He played a key role in politically sensitive negotiations over the construction of a pipeline in Azerbaijan . Later , he ran BP 's TNK-BP joint venture in Moscow , and helped oversee improvements in safety , accounting and drilling practices in old Soviet fields . His five-year stint ended in discord with BP 's Russian billionaire partners ; after being denied a visa , Dudley ran operations from abroad until an accord was reached on a successor . `` He has demonstrated an ability to operate successfully under pressure , '' West said . `` This is a guy who has really been battle-tested twice . '' A source close to the Russian partners in TNK-BP said that the dispute in Russia arose because `` we felt our strategies were diverging . It had nothing to do with Dudley . He 's a competent manager and has the potential to be a successful CEO . We partner with institutions , not individuals . Whoever they pick is their decision .

In announcing its second-quarter earnings , the London-based oil giant tried to walk a line between reassuring bankers and investors about its vast assets and financial strength , and avoiding the appearance of being a rich , powerful company insensitive to the plight of the Gulf Coast . `` We have much to do to make it right , '' BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in a conference call with investment analysts Tuesday , referring to the spill . But he added that BP 's directors are also `` determined to restore value to our shareholders . '' In mapping out plans to pay for damage and cleanup , BP said it will sell $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion in assets over 18 months , shedding about 10 percent of its oil and natural gas output . That should enable it to shrink its outstanding debt and reinstate dividends next year for shareholders while still covering payments to the massive escrow fund for spill damage claims . `` It 's still going to be the second-largest oil and gas producer among international oil companies , '' said Fadel Gheit , oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. `` Smaller than Exxon Mobil but bigger than Royal Dutch Shell . '' In a sign of how difficult it will be for BP to turn the page on the crisis , however , Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- lashed out Tuesday at the company for concealing its estimates of the rate at which oil had flowed into the gulf . Markey released a letter from BP Chief Operating Officer Douglas Suttles to the Coast Guard in early July in which Suttles estimated that oil was pouring forth at a rate of 53,000 barrels -LRB- 2.23 million gallons -RRB- a day . The BP briefing for investment analysts was a somber one , as Svanberg announced that the board had picked Robert Dudley , a BP managing director and former Amoco executive , to replace chief executive Tony Hayward , a British geologist who had spent his entire career with BP . Dudley , 54 , who grew up in Mississippi and spent summers boating with his family in the Gulf of Mexico , will become the first foreigner to lead the century-old company . `` Today is a very sad day for me , '' Hayward said . `` I love the company and everything it stands for . '' He said , however , he realized that for BP `` to move forward , particularly in the United States , it should do so under new leadership . '' Hayward 's compensation package includes a pension valued at about $ 17 million and a severance of $ 1.6 million , or a year 's salary . Without costs from the spill , the company would have declared a profit of $ 5.6 billion for the second quarter . Spill charges turned that into a $ 17.2 billion loss . The appointment of Dudley , who will take charge Oct. 1 , comes at a turning point in the calamity . After gushing for three months , the damaged oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been capped for the past 12 days . Kenneth Feinberg , the master for the $ 20 billion escrow fund , is taking over the task of scrutinizing and processing claims and proposing settlements . Still , Dudley 's task will be immense . Congress is set to raise liability limits for oil spills and to impose tougher regulations on offshore drilling . Some lawmakers want to prevent BP , the largest producer of oil and gas in the United States , from acquiring new federal leases . The Justice Department is investigating criminal charges against the company , which could complicate its ability to do business with the federal government or bid for leases . Asked how BP would be viewed in five years , Dudley said in `` a perfect world '' people would realize that `` BP met its commitments to restore the Gulf Coast and as a result of that BP has restored its reputation '' and it would be allowed to grow its U.S. business . He said , `` Five years from now , I hope that people look back and say that was a quite incredible response to a quite tragic accident . '' Although BP 's provision for claims and cleanup is unprecedented in size , some analysts questioned whether it is big enough . If found to be `` grossly negligent '' in the way it was drilling the Macondo well that exploded on April 20 , BP could wind up paying an additional $ 12 billion in fines alone and nearly twice as much overall , said Gheit of Oppenheimer . BP 's chief financial officer , Byron Grote , said that in calculating the size of anticipated federal fines under the Clean Water Act , BP assumed that it was not guilty of negligence . By doing so , it pegged its fines at $ 1,100 per barrel spilled . If found negligent , BP would have to pay $ 4,300 a barrel . It would also have to pay 100 percent of the fines , while Anadarko Petroleum and Mitsui , its partners in the lease , would not have to share the cost of the penalties . Critics in Congress decried the company 's failure to say precisely how much oil it thinks has spilled into the gulf . Hayward said only that BP had used a number around the middle of published estimates , which most recently have been 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day . In addition , BP 's financial statement reflected an offsetting tax benefit from lower earnings . Because the reserve for claims is deducted from profit , BP will not pay $ 9.9 billion in taxes that it would have otherwise owed . Bracing for unknown costs , BP also said that it would shrink its outstanding debt to $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion , from its current $ 23.2 billion . Dudley assumed his new title with modesty . He said he has the `` greatest respect '' for Hayward . `` I did not seek out this job , '' he said in a conference call with journalists . `` I was asked to step into these shoes . '' But in Washington , some people were ready to bid good riddance to Hayward , who had aggravated public anger by saying he wanted his `` life back '' and by going sailing on his yacht on his return to England after weeks on the gulf coast and in Washington . `` While it 's now happy sailing for Tony Hayward , rough conditions will persist in the Gulf of Mexico for years to come because of his failed leadership , '' Markey said . `` The new leaders of BP will have an uphill climb to correct the legacy left by Hayward , indelibly inked by the disaster in the gulf .

The squad at the FBI offices includes investigators from the Environmental Protection Agency , the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal agencies , the sources said . In addition to BP , the firms at the center of the inquiry are Transocean , which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig to BP , and engineering giant Halliburton , which had finished cementing the well only 20 hours before the rig exploded April 20 , sources said . While it was known that investigators are examining potential violations of environmental laws , it is now clear that they are also looking into whether company officials made false statements to regulators , obstructed justice or falsified test results for devices such as the rig 's failed blowout preventer . It is unclear whether any such evidence has surfaced . One emerging line of inquiry , sources said , is whether inspectors for the Minerals Management Service , the federal agency charged with regulating the oil industry -- which is itself investigating the disaster -- went easy on the companies in exchange for money or other inducements . A series of federal audits has documented the MMS 's close relationship with the industry . `` The net is wide , '' said one federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly . The Justice Department investigation -- announced in June by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and accompanied by parallel state criminal probes in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- is one of at least nine investigations into the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Unlike the public hearings held last week in Kenner , La. , by a federal investigatory panel , the criminal probe has operated in the shadows . But it could lead to large fines for the companies and jail time for executives if the government files charges and proves its case . Justice Department officials declined to comment Tuesday . Holder , in an interview with CBS News this month , confirmed that investigators are conducting a broad probe . `` There are a variety of entities and a variety of people who are the subjects of that investigation , '' Holder said . In an additional avenue of inquiry , BP disclosed in a regulatory filing Tuesday that the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into `` securities matters '' relating to the spill , although no more details were included .

For much of that time , his brother was a top executive at an energy company with significant activities under Dykes 's purview . But David Dykes did not formally recuse himself from matters involving his brother 's company . No rule required him to do so . Unlike many federal agencies that make employees distance themselves from matters involving friends , relatives or former bosses , the nation 's chief oil regulatory agency had no such policy . Now , in the wake of the BP disaster , Congress is pressing the agency formerly called the U.S. Minerals Management Service to clamp down on potential conflicts of interest . The case of David and Rodney Dykes highlights the challenges of the task . The oil industry of the Gulf Coast is an insular world in which rig foremen and the federal inspectors charged with regulating them sometimes work side by side , or grew up in the same towns and even homes . Investigations into the BP spill have focused on whether MMS regulators properly oversaw the Deepwater Horizon rig or merely accepted company assurances that the rig was safe . An inspector general investigation in May showed that MMS regulators in the gulf sometimes viewed themselves more as industry friends and fishing buddies than policemen . In one office , they took free trips , sporting tickets and gifts from industry officials they were supposed to be monitoring , the investigation found . Since June , the newly renamed Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -LRB- BOEM -RRB- has worked to develop new rules that would require inspectors to recuse themselves from matters in which they have a family or other personal conflict . Michael Bromwich , the new head of BOEM , said the agency needs a strong recusal policy to assuage public concerns about closeness between regulators and industry . `` Since arriving a month ago to lead reforms at BOEM , it is clear to me that there are concerns about conflicts of interest that we must address within the agency 's inspections and investigation programs . We 're looking very closely at these issues , including implementing new recusal policies and taking appropriate action where necessary , '' Bromwich said . Bromwich said he and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar have confidence in David Dykes 's work as co-chair of a team investigating the BP spill . Both David Dykes and his brother declined to comment . A spokesperson at the former MMS said David Dykes was never asked to review any matters involving Energy Partners , where Rodney Dykes was a senior vice president for production , or Stone Energy , a company under a tentative merger with the firm in 2006 . David Dykes , a native of Hammond , La. , has worked in the gulf oil business for nearly three decades , as had Rodney Dykes . David Dykes drew the attention of MMS officials when , as a safety manager at Taylor Oil , he helped shape a model safety plan . In 1999 , he joined MMS , and by 2005 , he was a senior safety inspector in the Office of Safety Management . He became office chief in February 2007 . David Dykes was considered a `` junkyard dog '' as an investigator , a former MMS manager said . His office oversaw accident investigations , issued industry safety alerts , imposed civil penalties and recommended regulation changes . Rodney Dykes stayed on the corporate side , including a short stint with his brother at Maxus Energy . By 2001 , he had joined Energy Partners Ltd. , and he rose to senior vice president in 2003 . From 2006 to early 2008 , Energy Partners and a company under a tentative merger agreement with it in 2006 reported 30 incidents including fires , explosions , collisions and injuries on their rigs and facilities , according to MMS records . The MMS judged 25 to be very minor or not meeting the criteria for an investigation , and did not probe further . District offices far below Dykes 's investigated the other five .

Their use , officials said , should be restricted to `` rare cases . '' But in reality , federal documents show , the use of dispersants was n't rare at all . Despite the order -- and concerns about the environmental effects of the dispersants -- the Coast Guard granted requests to use them 74 times over 54 days , and to use them on the surface and deep underwater at the well site . The Coast Guard approved every request submitted by BP or local Coast Guard commanders in Houma , La. , although in some cases it reduced the amount of the chemicals they could use , according to an analysis of the documents prepared by the office of Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . The documents indicate that `` these exemptions are in no way a ` rare ' occurrence , and have allowed surface application of the dispersant to occur virtually every day since the directive was issued , '' Markey wrote in a letter dated Aug. 1 to retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the government 's point man on the spill . Markey chairs the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming . Some of them dealt with separate dispersant applications on the same day . Markey said it appeared that the order `` has become more of a meaningless paperwork exercise '' than a real attempt to curb use of the dispersants . In an interview Saturday , Allen defended the decisions to grant the waivers , saying that overall use of dispersants declined sharply after that May 26 order to limit their use . The total use of dispersants underwater and on the surface declined about 72 percent from its peak , according to the Environmental Protection Agency . Allen said that on some days the amount of oil on the surface justified a `` tactical '' decision , by on-scene Coast Guard commanders , to spray some dispersants . `` There 's a dynamic tension that goes on when you 're managing an incident that has no precedent , '' Allen said . `` You establish general rules and guidelines , but knowing that the people on scene have the information '' means trusting them to make decisions , he said . In the end , Allen said : `` You can quibble on the semantics related to ` rare . ' I like to focus on the effects we achieved '' by dispersing the oil . Officials have said that , in the days since the gusher was stopped , thick sheets of oil have nearly disappeared from the gulf 's surface . EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson conceded that there had been `` frustration in the field '' from EPA officials about the waivers . But Jackson said it was partly alleviated June 22 , nearly a month after the order was issued , when Coast Guard officials began giving the EPA a greater role in the discussions over whether to approve dispersant use . `` EPA may not have concurred with every single waiver , '' Jackson said . But , she said , the Coast Guard had the ultimate say : `` The final decision-making rests with the federal on-scene coordinator . That 's where the judgment , the ultimate decision-making ability , had to lie .

The `` static kill '' is part of a double whammy of mud and cement that would hit the runaway Macondo well high and low in quick succession . The static kill starts at the top , firing the mud and possibly cement into the blowout preventer that sits on the wellhead . That effort , which would take a day or two , would be followed in another five to seven days by the start of the more laborious `` bottom kill , '' in which mud and cement will be injected into Macondo through a relief well that engineers began drilling at the beginning of May . If all goes perfectly , the one-two mud punch will literally be overkill . The static kill will terminate Macondo , and the bottom kill will be more like a confirmation test , akin to poking the body to make sure it 's dead . But optimism has been a dangerous attitude throughout the oil spill disaster , and the federal point man for the spill response , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , has warned against complacency . `` We should not be writing any obituary for this event , '' Allen said late last week . As he delivered the latest update on the static-kill plan Sunday afternoon , he also defended the government 's decision to let BP and its contractors use vast quantities of dispersants . He said that the goal of reducing the amount of dispersant used was `` generally met '' and that the government 's field commander made decisions to allow additional dispersant on a case-by-case basis . Although the environmental crisis has hardly passed , there is a sense these days among BP engineers and government scientists that they 've got the well in a headlock . The disaster began with cascading failures and continued with cascading disappointments as attempts to kill or contain the gusher never quite worked . But since July 15 the well has been shut in , thanks to a 75-ton cap lowered onto the re-configured chimney atop the damaged blowout preventer . -LRB- See photos of the cleanup and containment efforts . -RRB- The well has since passed an `` integrity test '' and , according to Allen , shows no sign of squirting oil and gas into the rock formation or up into the gulf . The positive turn of events has led to a change in the endgame . The static kill has emerged as a potential fix that could take the pressure off the relief-well job . With hurricane season about to hit its busiest stretch , officials have feared that a tropical storm could force the rig drilling the relief well to disengage and sail away temporarily , delaying the termination of Macondo . The static kill , which officials say could start late Monday or Tuesday , is effectively the same thing as the `` top kill '' attempted in late May . No one has ever been sure why the May attempt failed , but BP believes the mud simply shot out the top of the well through cracks and openings in the collapsed riser pipe . This time should be different , and easier . The hydrocarbons are n't flowing . The mud can be injected gradually , just a couple of barrels per minute . Where the mud will go is unclear ; engineers say only that it will follow the path of least resistance . The mud weighs about 13 pounds per gallon and is much heavier than the oil , so it should push -- or `` bullhead '' -- the oil back down the well toward its origin in the ancient rock more than 13,000 feet below the wellhead . Ideally the mud will fill the well all the way to the bottom of the well bore , where the final seven-inch pipe juts into the porous Macondo reservoir . If it works , the pressure in the well will slowly drop to zero from its current pressure of nearly 7,000 pounds per square inch . At that point , engineers could decide to send in a large dose of cement . That would permanently plug the well at its base . BP has said Macondo will never be resurrected as a production well . -LRB- See video of the oil spill 's impact on one Louisiana community . -RRB- But there could be complicating factors . Still unknown after all these months is which avenue from the reservoir the hydrocarbons have exploited . No one is sure if the oil and gas are flowing inside the pipe or outside the casing in what is called the annulus -- the space between the pipe and the rock wall of the hole . Or the flow could be through both . Because of such uncertainties , officials plan to proceed with the relief well regardless of what happens with the static kill . The relief well is only about 4 feet laterally from Macondo , angling in gradually , with about 100 feet to go before it intercepts the annulus . What happens in the bottom kill , and how long it takes , will depend on the circumstances of the static kill . The standard plan , outlined for months , has been to send mud through the relief well , initially into the annulus . After the mud will come cement . Then the drill string will be withdrawn and a new bit will be attached , a `` mill . '' That would be used for the next stage : cutting into the steel casing of the well and repeating the mud-and-cement injection . `` Once we 've made the intercept , depending upon the status of the well , whether we still have to kill the annulus , the casing , or both , the kill procedure could take anywhere from a number of days to a few weeks , '' BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said Friday . It 's conceivable that the static kill will take care only of hydrocarbons in the central pipe and leave hydrocarbons flowing in the annulus , Allen said . `` We 're not going to be satisfied until we drill into the annulus outside that pipe , '' he said . The endgame is having reverberations on the shore . Some Louisiana officials are concerned that the government and BP will bail out prematurely in their response to the spill . Roughly 1,500 private `` vessels of opportunity '' have been enlisted to skim oil , but with the gusher clamped and oil now harder to find , there will be `` resource leveling , '' Allen said Thursday . But he said the government has put together a plan to keep the fishermen employed at least through August . `` Obviously as we transition to a point where there is not a threat of a spill , and this is all conditioned on the fact that we will have a successful static kill and bottom kill of the well , the employment of vessels of opportunity is going to necessarily have to change , '' Allen said .

Every person working on the oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico had the authority to stop action , according to the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon , if he or she considered the situation unsafe . Yet people exposed to an array of hazards refrained from demanding a halt , reflecting a pattern that extends to almost any office cubicle or industrial site . It is hard to rock the boat -- until it bursts into flames and sinks to the bottom of the ocean -- and a safety policy based on the assumption that any individual will rock the boat is likely to be flawed . Case in point : Michael Williams , a chief electronics technician on the Deepwater Horizon who displayed remarkable courage during the disaster and who brought those challenges into focus in testimony to a federal investigative board last month . He described speaking up about problems but there were limits to what he could or would do . Williams , an employee of rig owner Transocean , said he thought that the blowout preventer -- the last line of defense against a gusher -- had been damaged and that he had seen chunks of its black rubber innards ejected from the well . There was never enough time to keep up with scheduled maintenance on the rig , he said , and some parts were so old that it took a year to get replacements custom made . In addition , to avoid the nuisance of false alarms , a system meant to automatically warn the entire crew about fire or leaking gas was routinely deactivated . Meanwhile , a computer used to monitor and control drilling operations intermittently crashed , leaving the driller staring at `` the blue screen of death . '' In the middle of sensitive operations , the driller could switch chairs and move to backup computers , but if the backups failed , Williams said , the next step would be to `` abandon ship . '' Switching to a backup is not without risk , he pointed out : During the drilling of an earlier well , while the computer was out of commission for several seconds , the rig incurred a kick of gas , he said . At the government hearing in Kenner , La. , attorneys for BP , Transocean and the captain of the Deepwater Horizon pressed Williams about his power to shut down the rig . `` I want to ask whether or not you knew that you in fact not only had a right but you had an obligation to stop anything that you believed to be unsafe , '' said Kyle Schonekas , an attorney for the captain . `` You ever ask to stop operations on the rig because of the blue screen of death ? '' BP attorney Richard Godfrey asked . `` No , I did not . We had two other chairs , '' Williams answered .

BP 's Macondo well spewed 62,000 barrels of oil a day initially , and as the reservoir gradually depleted itself , the flow eased to 53,000 barrels a day until the well was finally capped and sealed July 15 , according to scientists in the Flow Rate Technical Group , supervised by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Energy . The new numbers once again have nudged upward the statistical scale of the disaster . If correct -- the government allows for a margin of error of 10 percent -- the flow rate would make this spill significantly larger than the Ixtoc I blowout of 1979 , which polluted the southern Gulf of Mexico with 138 million gallons over the course of 10 months . That had been the largest unintentional oil spill in history , surpassed only by the intentional spills in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War . The new flow rate figures came as engineers made final preparations for a `` static kill '' operation that might plug the well permanently even before a relief well intercepts Macondo at its base . BP announced late Monday that the procedure would be delayed , probably until Tuesday , because of a leak in the hydraulic control system on the well 's new cap . Macondo 's flow rate has been a major source of controversy since the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon . Early in the crisis , the Coast Guard and BP pegged the flow at 5,000 barrels a day , sticking with that figure even as outside scientists declared that it low-balled the actual rate . The flow rate team , assembled in May , tried to come up with a more solid figure . Scientists examining the surface slick as well as video taken by submersibles soon upped the estimate ; by early June , the government declared the flow to be 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day . Even the high end of that estimate did not quite do justice to Macondo when it was at full throttle in the early weeks of the crisis . The new figures reflect more data , including high-definition video , sonar measurements of the oil-gas ratio , and pressure readings in the new capping stack before , and then after , the sealing of the well July 15 . `` We may never know the exact answer . But as we get more data , you 're able to shrink the uncertainty , '' said Bill Lehr , senior scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a leader of one of the teams . The new figures indicate that the roughly 800,000 barrels of oil that BP managed to capture with its various containment strategies -- a riser insertion tool , a `` top hat , '' and flaring from a surface rig -- represented only about one-sixth of the crude that surged into the gulf over the course of nearly three months . In all , about 1.2 million barrels of oil have been accounted for , either burned , captured or skimmed off the ocean 's surface . That 's about a quarter of the new estimate for the total spill . Where the other three-quarters has gone is unclear . Some has evaporated ; some has been consumed by microbes ; but scientists remain troubled by the possibility that large amounts of oil remain underwater in cloudlike plumes . `` This further confirms that a lot of the oil is still at sea . And we just do n't know the implications of it , '' said Ron Kendall , director of the Institute of Environmental and Human Health at Texas Tech University . Kendall will testify before Congress on Wednesday about his fears that dispersant chemicals have helped much of this oil sink into deep-sea habitats . For government lawyers preparing a case against BP , this number could help calculate the maximum civil penalty BP might face for the spill . If BP is not found to have acted with negligence , the penalty would be $ 1,100 per barrel . About 4.1 million barrels escaped into the gulf , according to the new estimate , so that fine would come to $ 4.5 billion . If BP is found to have acted with `` gross negligence '' in the lead-up to the spill , the maximum penalty would be $ 4,300 a barrel , which would work out to $ 17.6 billion . `` You 've got to go in with a number , '' said David Uhlmann , a law professor at the University of Michigan and the former chief of the Justic Department 's Environmental Crimes Section . `` And I think these numbers strengthen the government 's hand , '' compared with previous estimates that produced only a range . In all , the 4.1 million barrels estimated to have polluted the gulf would be enough to fill the Pentagon to a depth of 18 feet or to fill 260 Olympic swimming pools . The entire Gulf of Mexico , by comparison , would fill 880 million Pentagons , or 973 billion Olympic pools . John Amos at SkyTruth , an organization that uses satellite imagery to study environmental problems , said that this new figure showed how far off BP and the Coast Guard were in the crucial days at the beginning of the spill . `` When the next spill happens , being in the right order of magnitude with the spill estimate is going to be important , '' he said . The well remains pressurized and dangerous , but BP and government officials hope that will change with the static kill attempt . The goal is to inject mud into the well and drive the oil back to the source rock . First comes what BP calls an injectivity test . Mud will be pumped into the well from a surface ship at a gentle rate of one barrel a minute , then two barrels a minute , then three , as engineers monitor pressures and look for signs that the rogue oil is being forced back into the source rock 21\\/2 miles below the seafloor . `` We want to confirm that we can inject the oil that 's in the well bore back into the reservoir , '' BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells told reporters Monday .

President Obama cautioned that much recovery work remains , and other officials warned that the threat from the damaged Macondo well will not be eliminated until it is `` killed '' later this month with a relief well . Moreover , federal officials said , the long-term effects of the oil spill , the worst in the nation 's history , remain to be determined . But in view of a series of early setbacks in efforts to control the blown-out well , BP 's announcement early Wednesday that it had reached a `` static condition '' came as a huge relief . The term meant that pressure inside the well was brought under control through a mud-pumping process that began Tuesday afternoon . BP called the achievement `` a significant milestone '' and said it stopped pumping mud into the Macondo well after about eight hours because the effort had been successful . `` The well is now being monitored , per the agreed procedure , to ensure it remains static , '' the company said in a statement . `` Further pumping of mud may or may not be required depending on results observed during monitoring . '' In a speech in Washington , Obama called the development welcome news . He also pointed to the report released Wednesday by government scientists who found that an estimated 74 percent of the oil has been recovered , burned , dispersed , evaporated , consumed by microbes or otherwise removed from the gulf . `` The long battle to stop the leak and contain the oil is finally close to coming to an end , and we are very pleased with that , '' Obama said at a meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Council . Obama added : `` Our recovery efforts , though , will continue . We have to reverse the damage that 's been done . We will continue to work to hold polluters accountable for the destruction they 've caused . We 've got to make sure that folks who were harmed are reimbursed , and we 're going to stand by the people of the region for however long it takes until they 're back on their feet . '' As they huddled in BP 's operations center , federal officials tried to manage expectations , saying that even if the operation known as `` static kill '' went as hoped , the well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico would not be finally plugged until it was intercepted and cemented by a relief well that crews have been drilling for three months . The federal official in charge of the oil spill response , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , told a New Orleans television station Wednesday that pumping mud into the blown-out well took care of the immediate threat but that the `` bottom kill '' technique involving the 18,000-foot relief well would still go ahead . `` We 've pretty much made this well not a threat , but we need to finish this from the bottom , '' Allen told WWL-TV .

Although BP took a pass , the group 's advocacy arm went ahead with a campaign -- only instead of defending BP , it vilified the company as a `` safety outlier '' in an otherwise safe industry . The campaign 's Web site features dozens of images of the burning rig , oil-smeared birds and other environmental devastation from the spill . `` BP is a victim of its own carelessness , '' the group 's president , Thomas Pyle , wrote as part of the campaign 's kickoff in early July . `` The rest of us should not be . '' To backers of BP who were familiar with the discussions and spoke on the condition of anonymity , it seemed an awful lot like a shakedown . The initial proposal contained no criticism of the British oil giant or its handling of the spill . A BP spokesman declined to comment . But Pyle , previously an oil-industry lobbyist and an aide to former congressman and Texas Republican Tom DeLay , said the anti-BP message was part of a separate campaign and was not intended as retaliation . `` A lot of people were trying to lump the industry together as one cohesive unit , '' Pyle said in an interview . `` Our point was to not judge the whole industry by one incident and one actor . '' The case illustrates the murky world of advocacy-for-hire in Washington , where ideological groups wage stealth messaging campaigns with little disclosure of their funding or possible motives . Such arrangements rarely come to light since most advocacy groups are organized as nonprofits that do not have to disclose details about their donors . In another case last year , the head of the American Conservative Union , a prominent Washington advocacy group , came under fire for siding with UPS in a labor battle after rival FedEx declined a request to fund the group . The BP dispute also underscores the tensions that have flared between factions of the oil and gas industry , as Congress has debated whether to enact new drilling restrictions . The anti-BP effort , for example , is supported by the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition , which has sought to emphasize the risks of the deepwater wells that are a major part of BP 's business . The campaign operates under the name `` Save U.S. Energy Jobs , '' which is described as a project of the American Energy Alliance , the advocacy arm of IER . The group is flying in about 50 oil-industry employees to Washington for a Wednesday rally to be headlined by Sen. John Cornyn -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee . A copy of the initial campaign pitch , which was obtained by The Washington Post , laid out plans for a $ 570,000 `` energy rapid response team '' to counter criticism from `` anti-energy groups '' attempting to `` politicize the Gulf Spill . '' The two-page outline proposed a `` campaign-style war room '' to `` monitor and challenge any anti-energy rhetoric in the blogosphere , in newspapers and on television .

Engineers started the cementing operation at 10:15 a.m. EDT and completed it at 3:15 EDT . It was the second step in the `` static kill , '' in which heavy mud was first pumped into the well from the surface to stop it from leaking crude into the gulf . BP said in a statement that the static kill procedure will `` complement '' a separate effort to plug the well through a relief well that is nearing completion in a technique known as the `` bottom kill . '' Earlier , the company announced that retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander for the disaster , had authorized the cementing operation , which was under consideration following the successful effort to pump mud into the well . The development comes a day after the Macondo well became an apparently harmless hole in the seafloor , clogged with 13-pound-per-gallon gunk , and barely more of a threat to spew oil into the Gulf of Mexico than to start gushing lemonade . On the 107th day of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the well that tormented the nation had flatlined . Federal officials then green-lighted the cementing of the well , already jammed with mud , late Wednesday . Federal waters are reopening gradually to fishing . The oil slick , the once-horrific expanse of red-orange mousse and silver sheen , has largely disappeared , federal scientists said Wednesday , even though the amount of oil left is more than four times that dumped by the Exxon Valdez . The Obama administration breathed a sigh of relief , holding a midday news conference featuring top officials who claimed credit for guiding BP in getting the well under control . Officials hastened to remind the public that Macondo wo n't be incontrovertibly dead until a relief well drills into it near its base and plugs it with cement . But even the cautious Allen , the official in charge of the federal response to the disaster , called the static kill a `` fairly consequential '' event and a `` very significant step . '' About three-quarters of the nearly 5 million barrels of oil that escaped Macondo has evaporated , dissolved or been dispersed by chemicals , skimmed by boats , burned , weathered and , most important , devoured by the Gulf of Mexico 's permanent oil-eating microbial workforce , according to a study released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Interior Department . `` Mother Nature is assisting here considerably , '' said NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco . This should terminate , once and for all , the more apocalyptic scenarios for the demise of the gulf and the spread of oil to Atlantic shores . There is no sign that the oil is going to ride the Loop Current onto the beaches of South Florida , the Outer Banks , Bermuda , Ireland and so on . Just a month ago , the spill was an uncontrolled calamity : Macondo mocked the technological skills of the world 's petroleum engineers , and oil was slathering birds and turtles and tar-balling hundreds of miles of coastline . The turning point came when BP put a new tight-fitting cap on the well July 12 and closed the valves three days later , cutting off the ugly geyser of oil that had become a dominant image of the summer . Federal scientists have said that vigilance would be called for even after the static kill procedure worked , which , according to BP in a 2 a.m. announcement , it did .

A few hours after BP 's well was declared virtually dead , the Obama administration announced Wednesday that only about 26 percent of the oil spilled in the Gulf of Mexico was unaccounted for . `` A significant amount of this , '' said Jane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , `` is a direct result of the very robust federal response efforts . '' But , in interviews , scientists who worked on the report said the figures were based in large part on assumptions and estimates with a significant margin of error . Some outside scientists went further : In a situation in which many facts remain murky , they said , the government seemed to have used interpretations that made the gulf -- and the federal efforts to save it -- look as good as possible . `` There 's a lot of ... smoke and mirrors in this report , '' said Ian MacDonald , a professor of biological oceanography at Florida State University . `` It seems very reassuring , but the data are n't there to actually bear out the assurances that were made . '' The government 's accounting of the spilled oil , called an `` oil budget , '' was announced Wednesday at the White House . It appeared to answer the most troubling question : Of the 4.9 million barrels -LRB- 205.8 million gallons -RRB- that poured out of the well , only 827,000 barrels were siphoned to vessels on the surface . Where did the rest of it go ? Where there had been mystery , now there was a pie chart . It showed that 5 percent of the total oil had been burned and that 3 percent had been skimmed off the surface . An additional 25 percent had evaporated or dissolved . About another quarter had been `` dispersed '' -- broken into tiny droplets by chemicals or by the force of being blasted out of the well . The dispersed oil , Lubchenco said , `` is in the process of being very rapidly degraded naturally , and so Mother Nature is assisting here considerably . '' She said , however , that `` diluted and out of sight does n't necessarily mean benign . '' Those facts did not seem to support a statement that White House climate and energy czar Carol M. Browner made Wednesday on NBC 's `` Today '' show . An initial assessment showed that `` more than three-quarters of the oil is gone . The vast majority of the oil is gone , '' she said . At best , the report shows that three-quarters of the oil could be on its way out : It does not say that it has vanished . The remaining 26 percent or so of the oil was still unaccounted for , although Lubchenco said that did not necessarily mean it is still causing ecological harm .

And now , questions about how much of the oil is gone and how much is just unaccounted for . `` The pattern that we see here is a pattern of inadequate oversight and supervision -LRB- in government -RRB- and an industry that appears to cut corners , '' said the National Wildlife Federation 's Tim Warman , who helped write a report documenting hundreds of accidents in the oil and gas industry in the past decade . It went to the printer last month , two days before the Michigan spill began . `` The pattern suggests that we 're going to see more of them , '' Warman said .

That is n't much compared with the gulf spill , in which 4.9 million barrels -LRB- 205.8 million gallons -RRB- escaped , according to an analysis this week .

In a letter sent in response to questions from Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- , the agency responsible for ensuring the safety of seafood said that chemicals used to break up the slicks are not as dangerous to human health as the oil itself . FDA scientists do not think that the chemicals accumulate significantly in the tissue of fish and shellfish ; even if fish absorb the chemicals through gills or other ways , the fish do not retain them , Jeanne Ireland , the FDA 's assistant commissioner for legislation , wrote to Markey . That means the chemicals are not passed up the food chain to humans and are not considered a public health concern , according to the FDA . BP sprayed 1.8 million gallons of the dispersant Corexit on the surface of the gulf and , for the first time , at the wellhead a mile underwater . Dispersants were last used July 19 , four days after BP temporarily capped its leaking well . The ingredients in the dispersants were initially considered classified business information . Under a 1976 federal law , only a handful of employees at the Environmental Protection Agency were privy to the ingredients and were barred from divulging them . But under pressure from the Obama administration , Corexit 's manufacturer , Nalco Holding , agreed to disclose the ingredients to the EPA , which shared them with other federal and state agencies and then made them public . The ingredients include propylene glycol , a chemical permitted by the FDA as a food additive and used in medicines , cosmetics and toothpaste ; 2-butoxyethanol , which is found in cleaners , liquid soaps and cosmetics and quickly degrades in the environment ; and a proprietary form of sulfonic acid salt , which is `` moderately '' toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates but which the manufacturer says degrades quickly . In addition , Corexit contains volatile organic solvents that are made from crude oil and are not considered by the FDA to pose a public health concern because they do not accumulate significantly in the flesh of fish , according to Ireland . The FDA is not monitoring fish and shellfish for the presence of Corexit in seafood because it is not considered a health risk , Ireland said . Instead , the agency has examined gulf seafood for signs of oil contamination , which agency scientists say poses a health risk to anyone who eats the affected fish . Sensory experts working for the FDA and NOAA smelled samples of gulf fish to make sure there was no odor from oil or chemicals . If the samples passed that test , they were subjected to laboratory analysis to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , which come from oil . Some can cause cancer and other health effects in humans . In consultation with the FDA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has slowly reopened sections of gulf waters to fishing . About 24 percent of federal waters along the gulf are closed to fishing , down from a peak of about 37 percent in early June . But Markey said questions remain about the impact of the chemicals over time . `` We know almost nothing about the long-term effects of either oil or dispersants on the aquatic food chain , '' he said .

The remaining fourth , said White House energy chief Carol M. Browner , will also slowly degrade or disappear , making the risk of catastrophic contamination smaller . Could it be that President Obama overstated the severity of the spill when the leak was still gushing , calling it the '' worst environmental disaster American has ever faced '' ? He , of course , was hardly the most theatrical -- remember Cajun pundit James Carville 's on-air exclamations of , '' We 're about to die down here '' ? The lesson : In the midst of a big , unprecedented event affecting complicated systems with uncertain consequences , it 's better not to jump to superlative conclusions too soon . The same caution should accompany the apparently good news last week . The spill was so large that even a fourth left over is a huge volume of crude , some of it possibly buried in places where it could take a long time to degrade . The massive amounts dispersed in the gulf may have long-term consequences for sea life . There also may be huge amounts of natural gas and methane in the water . Though the most visible damage occurs shortly after oil spills , it takes much more time for the full effects to be known . See , for example , the persistent environmental degradation that plagues even decades-old oil spill zones , from sickly mangrove swamps in Mexico to stunted fiddler crabs in Massachusetts . Now is the time to conduct careful study of what still requires cleaning up , not to declare mission accomplished . Congress , too , must keep this in mind .

Its work in such high-visibility missions accelerated after Sept. 11 , 2001 , when Congress swept the Coast Guard into the Homeland Security Department . But the changes had the unintended consequence of lowering the profile of the Coast Guard 's vital programs related to oil . `` Priorities changed , '' a 2002 Coast Guard budget report said . Internal and congressional studies highlighted the difficulty the agency faces in balancing its many added responsibilities . `` Oil-spill issues were not at the top of the list , '' said retired Capt. Lawson Brigham , a former strategic planner for the Coast Guard . When Coast Guard inspectors board offshore drilling rigs such as the Deepwater Horizon , which exploded and killed 11 workers in April , they rely on regulations put in place three decades ago , when offshore drilling operations were far less sophisticated , records show . The Coast Guard acknowledged 11 years ago in a little-noticed disclosure that its regulations had `` not kept pace with the changing offshore technology or the safety problems it creates . '' Since the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , investigations into oversight gaps have focused on systemic problems within the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , which in recent weeks has been renamed and revamped . But the Coast Guard , which shared oversight with MMS , has largely escaped scrutiny . While the MMS inspected drilling equipment , the Coast Guard inspected rigs for worker safety . It also set standards for companies that clean up spills , and has coordinated the joint response to the spill in the gulf . Some analysts said the spill highlights the need to rethink Coast Guard priorities . In the past 35 years , Congress has handed the agency at least 27 new responsibilities , according to a tally by Rep. James L. Oberstar -LRB- D-Minn . -RRB- , chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee . `` They just do n't have enough personnel to carry out all those missions , '' said Oberstar , who favors severing the Coast Guard from the Homeland Security Department . `` That 's just not possible . '' Coast Guard officials said they did not have budget figures to compare how much is spent on oil-related programs now and before Sept. 11 , 2001 . Even current budget numbers for these programs are unclear because spending falls into two categories that encompass many other activities , including fighting invasive species and oversight of recreational boating . Marine environmental protection was allotted 2 percent of this year 's operating expenses , marine safety 8 percent . The Coast Guard said that before 2001 , the agency was organized differently . A private study in 2003 by one Coast Guard officer calculated that , before the attacks , marine environmental programs accounted for 11 percent of operating funds and marine safety accounted for 14 percent . Congressional staffers said the lack of reliable figures has complicated their efforts to ensure that vital programs are not neglected .

Not once , '' Harris said , sitting on his 73-foot-long shrimp boat beside a box filled with unused rubber boots , gloves and coveralls . `` What a waste . '' Harris is a part of BP 's Vessels of Opportunity program that promised to turn out-of-work fishermen into a powerful task force , skimming and scooping up oil before it reached the shores of Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana and Florida . At its peak , the program dispatched 3,200 boats at an average cost of $ 2,000 a day . In recent weeks , with a successful capping operation containing the spewing well , the oil company has scaled back to about 1,400 vessels . Fishermen involved in the program and the company that runs it both say the effort -- costing $ 450 million so far -- has been fraught with problems . Much of the money doled out by BP probably went to opportunists rather than to commercial fishermen and charter boat operators whose livelihoods were disrupted by the spill . Harris and dozens of other fishermen said in interviews with The Washington Post that the amateur effort , which included laying and maintaining boom , failed to prevent oil from reaching the beaches , marshes and islands near their homes . BP officials acknowledged that payments as high as $ 100,000 might have gone to recreational boat owners and others who enrolled multiple boats in the program and quickly seized an opportunity to cash in . But the officials said that it took time to identify problems and make needed reforms . `` When a response of this size gets pulled together that quickly , things fall through the cracks , '' BP spokesman George Gigicos said . Boat sales spiked in states around the gulf . And even though fishing was banned in as much as 40 percent of the water , officials saw a double-digit rise in demand for fishing licenses in three gulf states in April through July over last year 's totals , according to data analysis done for The Post by wildlife officials in the four affected states . In Alabama , license sales shot up 66 percent ; in Mississippi , they rose 30 percent ; and in Louisiana , they went up 13 percent . In late June , more than two months into the program , BP began asking participants for proof that their licenses had been issued before the oil spill , company officials said . The company also started a rotation system in mid-July that officials said they hope will pull in fishermen who have been passed by . `` I 've been waiting by the phone for three months . I 've heard nothing . I 'm still not in , '' said Jerry Walker , who fishes for kingfish and red snapper in Louisiana . `` I 've been a fisherman for 40 years . I make 100 percent of my living from fishing . These guys out on the water , I 've never seen any of them before in my life . '' Gigicos said : `` It did take some time to weed out the recreational vessels and the out-of town-vessels . It was n't perfect at first . '' He added , `` But for a while , our motto was ` All hands on deck . ' We needed everyone we could get out there . '' Fishermen and harbor chiefs describe the program 's early days as chaotic and unproductive . Coast Guard planes flew overhead and spotted oil , but their crews were unable to communicate with the rag-tag bands floating beneath them . Repeatedly , boat owners in the program said in interviews that they thought they were part of a `` show . '' `` The entire task force was on different radio frequencies , '' said Michael White , harbor chief in Long Beach , Miss. `` I had to surf through 15 channels to find someone . From a distance , it looked good to have all those boats out there , but it was a mess . '' At the height of the program , participants thought their boats would be equipped to skim oil from the surface of the gulf waters . Retired Coast Guard Adm.

As beach cleanup is scaled down , the fate of all the oily trash created and collected along the Gulf Coast is causing a raging debate that BP and federal officials are trying hard to curb . `` We 're getting all kinds of complaints from people , '' said Burnell Tolbert , president of the NAACP branch in nearby Lafourche Parish , a staging area where more than 2,500 tons of waste has been deposited . People want to know what is in those trash bags , where they will end up and if the workers handling the oily trash are safe , he said . The answers are leaving important groups unsatisfied . One coastal county threatened to sue BP if it continues to put trash from the spill in a local landfill . Not wanting to get into a tussle with the residents , the company relented , diverting the trash to other landfills . Others are arguing that too much of the trash is going to low-income and minority communities . The oil from BP 's rig explosion in April has already created more than 45,000 tons of garbage -- the solid oil and all the materials used to gather it -- and much more oily liquid waste . The trash is being shipped every day to nine landfills that store household garbage and non-hazardous industrial waste in communities across Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida . The Coast Guard , the Environmental Protection Agency and BP are `` working hand in hand '' to manage all that trash -- and are reaching out to community groups to try to allay fears that chemicals from the oil-soaked material could seep into the groundwater drinking supply , said BP spokesman Scott Dean . The federal government issued a 34-page plan directing BP to recycle and reuse as much trash as it can and to post information about the trash it is collecting online . -LRB- So far about 50 tons of trash has been recycled , according to BP . -RRB- The government also has asked the company to start holding meetings with the communities around the landfills . Still , contractors working for BP bag tons of trash daily . From Grand Isle alone , anywhere between eight and 16 dump trucks a day carry trash to landfills throughout Louisiana . The oily water is processed for refining . From the isle , waste is trucked to places such as Venice , La. -- a small strip of land surrounded by bayous in the southernmost reaches of the state . The big landfill there -- with its rolling hills of decaying metal and household trash -- has already received 2,800 tons of oily waste , according to BP . ' A slap in the face ' Kindra Arnesen , who lives about four miles from the landfill , sent her children to live 200 miles inland because she 's worried about all that the oil spill has left in its wake . `` I grew up being told not to even throw a Coke bottle in the bayou , '' she said .

The conflict flared Thursday when Transocean fired off a scathing letter accusing BP of hoarding information and test results related to the Deepwater Horizon blowout that killed 11 people , including nine Transocean employees . Signed by Transocean 's acting co-general counsel , Steven L. Roberts , the letter says that Transocean 's internal investigation of what went wrong has been hampered by BP 's refusal to deliver `` even the most basic information '' about the event . '' -LRB- I -RRB- t appears that BP is withholding evidence in an attempt to prevent any entity other than BP from investigating the cause of the April 20th incident and the resulting spill , '' the letter states , and it demands a long list of technical documents and lab tests . BP 's associate general counsel , James Neath , responded late Thursday by blasting the Roberts letter as `` nothing more than a publicity stunt evidently designed to draw attention away from Transocean 's potential role in the Deepwater Horizon tragedy . '' Neath said BP had turned over more than 100,000 documents to Transocean , and demanded , in turn , that Transocean make the results of its own internal investigation public . The stakes are high for both companies . They potentially are targets of a Justice Department criminal probe . Both have sent a string of witnesses before an investigatory panel jointly led by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -LRB- formerly the Minerals Management Service -RRB- . A presidential commission is also looking into the blowout , and BP is expected to produce its report on the accident in the coming weeks . Throughout these events , BP continues to lease two Transocean drilling rigs and a Transocean ship in the effort to plug and kill the well . The endgame has become more complicated . After extensive deliberations , government scientists and BP engineers have decided to remove the infamous blowout preventer atop the well -- if , that is , BP can assure the government that it can retrieve the massive contraption without creating new problems with the well that has been plugged since early this month . The decision to remove the blowout preventer and replace it with a new one is likely to delay until after Labor Day the final bottom-kill of the well using mud and cement from a relief well , retired Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander , said Thursday . That new well has been drilled to within a few feet laterally of BP 's Macondo well , with only about 50 feet of vertical drilling still to go . But with the final termination of Macondo close at hand , government officials and BP engineers have been hedging their bets , trying to figure out ways to minimize the risk of something going wrong at the last moment with a well that already has nearly a mile of cement in its central casing . `` We are very close to putting this well away . None of us wants to make a mistake at this point , '' Allen said . The primary concern has been that , in pushing more mud into the `` annulus '' of the well -- the narrow space between the steel casing and the rock wall of the well -- oil trapped in that space might become more highly pressurized and burst through a seal at the top of the well . That would let some oil back into the gulf , and it could potentially damage the blowout preventer , the most crucial piece of evidence for investigations into what went wrong . Before the blowout preventer is removed , BP will finish an `` ambient pressure test , '' which began Thursday morning . The blowout preventer and capping stack on the well have been flushed out and filled with seawater . The idea is to see if the pressure of seawater is enough to keep the well from flowing . Next , engineers will conduct a `` fishing experiment '' in which they will open up the capping stack and blowout preventer and try to retrieve the drillpipe that is believed to be dangling in the well . As much as 3,500 feet of drillpipe may still be in the well , BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said Thursday . Once that is accomplished , the capping stack and blowout preventer can be sequentially removed , and a new blowout preventer placed on the well .

Landrieu urged the audience to visit Louisiana . He also emphasized the need to lift the federal moratorium on deepwater drilling . He said he would discuss the issue with President Obama when he visits the gulf Aug. 29 to mark the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina 's devastating hit . The Obama administration banned such drilling after the BP oil spill disaster . Although BP has been negligent and irresponsible , he said , drilling oil is necessary to let the Gulf coast continue providing energy and food to the rest of the country . `` We are not limited to ` drill , baby , drill ' or stop drilling forever . We can do better , '' Landrieu said . `` We must drill and restore . '' The city 's transformation will be slow and dependent on resources , but Landrieu said there will be more immediate transformation in the city 's safety , schools and job market . New Orleans is also facing a $ 79 million hole in its $ 460 million budget . Landrieu said cuts have included 14 furlough days for city employees and reorganizing usage of overtime . Still , he 'd like to see New Orleans back on its feet in time for the city 's 300th anniversary in 2018 . As New Orleans builds from the ground up , Landrieu said , the city is already seeing a revival in volunteerism and nightlife . Student test scores have also gone up in the past three years .

Feinberg -- Washington 's expert in the messy business of valuing tragedy in dollars and cents -- officially takes over one of the messiest cases of his career . Feinberg , who oversaw compensation funds for victims of Agent Orange , the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the 2007 shooting rampage at Virginia Tech , was appointed by BP and President Obama to oversee claims from the oil spill . Now the job of making the Gulf Coast whole is about to shift from BP to him . On Friday , Feinberg released a `` protocol '' for parceling out emergency claims over the next three months . These were only vague guidelines , though they hinted that those closest to the oil might have the best chance of getting paid . In interviews , legal experts and Gulf Coast residents say that Feinberg 's job looks more complex than his famous work after the 2001 attacks . The spill 's impact rippled through an interconnected economy , with losses at oil-free beaches in Florida and at oyster-shucking plants along the faraway Chesapeake Bay . And even when a loss is obvious -- as with gulf fishermen -- its value might be tied up in murky counterfactuals : Who can say how many shrimp one of them would have caught ? `` None of these go swimmingly , '' Feinberg said in an interview Friday . `` There are hurdles and challenges all along the way . Human nature being what it is , people have expectations . Inevitably some people are satisfied and some are n't . It goes with the territory . You do the best you can . '' In the four months since the spill began , BP has handed claims for compensation of lost income . The oil company has received 153,974 claims as of Friday , and paid about 125,000 of those , for a total payout of $ 395 million . On Monday , all pending claims will be handed to Feinberg . These will include murkier cases where the claim originates far from the spill itself , or involves indirect impacts on groups such as beach-town real estate agents . Feinberg 's job is to parcel out $ 20 billion in BP funds , from an escrow account the company established at the insistence of the White House . Fees to his law firm will be paid out of interest payments from the $ 20 billion . The protocol issued Friday by Feinberg says that people and businesses still awaiting payment from BP must file new forms with his Gulf Coast Claims Facility before their claim will be paid . Between Monday and Nov. 23 , they can file requests for `` emergency advance payments , '' compensating for losses from the first six months after the spill . After that , Feinberg will decide on `` final '' payments . A final claim , however , will carry a procedure for releasing BP -- and perhaps other companies -- from liability . Around the Gulf Coast this week , there were worries that Feinberg 's fund would n't do enough , or that the Washington lawyer would fail to understand the complicated connections that spread the spill 's pain far and wide . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- complained about the need for his residents to file new paperwork , while Grand Isle , La. , seafood dealer Dean Blanchard said he liked Feinberg but feared he would n't come through . `` If you got six months to live , you want Feinberg to tell you '' because of his comforting manner , said Blanchard , who said he lived at `` ground zero '' for the spill 's impact . But , Blanchard said , would Feinberg understand that the weather predicted a huge year for shrimp , before the oil killed the shrimping season ? If he did n't , Blanchard might not get all of the $ 300,000-plus he still needs for unpaid bills . `` I figured out what ` ground zero ' means . That means zero money for Dean , '' he said . Further from the well , the questions multiplied . In Alabama , fishermen said it would be unfair if those who worked for BP 's cleanup , providing `` Vessels of Opportunity , '' had their pay subtracted from their spill compensation . `` You 're out there in a 121-degree heat index , pulling boom or skimming or scooping or picking up tar balls , and they 're going to take that away from you , '' said Avery Bates of the Organized Seafood Association of Alabama . In St. Pete Beach , Fla. , a resort company that never saw a drop of oil has tallied $ 1.7 million in lost revenue -- reasoning that news reports about oil in the gulf scared people off . That will go in Feinberg 's queue , along with a request from faraway Weems , Va. . There , on a Chesapeake Bay tributary 800 miles from the gulf , W.E. Kellum Seafood had come to rely on oysters from the gulf . The oil spill cut its supply . Now , after receiving only a small payment from BP , it is waiting on Feinberg to cut the firm a check .

The government had ultimate authority ; BP had the technology to plug the Macondo well . Something known as the National Contingency Plan called for a `` unified command '' in which government officials would issue orders and make pronouncements but BP would do the most crucial work and be the `` responsible party . '' Who was in charge , really ? The well kept gushing ; everyone looked bad . Reporters asked top officials why the government did n't simply take over . But we 're in charge already , the officials said . The fact is , the two sides formed a team , weird as that might be at times . That is true today , still , with the Macondo well looking rather dead -- choked by a mile of cement -- but not yet terminated to everyone 's satisfaction . Government scientists and BP engineers have been devising a complex endgame . Before Macondo receives a conclusive dose of mud and cement at its base via a relief well , engineers want to take the old , damaged blowout preventer off the wellhead and replace it with a new blowout preventer . That will delay the `` bottom kill '' until after Labor Day , according to retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander . BP engineers and the government scientists come from different cultures . In general , the engineers want to plunge ahead , and the scientists want to go slower . `` We helped them see that there are dangers lurking here , and there and everywhere , '' Energy Secretary Steven Chu told The Washington Post . `` The Department of Energy is in charge of the nuclear arsenal ... This is no messing around . In our culture , you want to make sure that nothing can go wrong . '' The Obama administration has claimed credit for turning an uncontrolled calamity into something managed and mastered . The response to the disaster would have been different , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said after the well had been plugged with cement , had the administration not `` pushed at every step of the way '' for BP to `` do things more comprehensively and faster . '' BP has stayed clear of that debate . `` I 've got a philosophy that when you 're in the middle of the response , you stay focused on the response . When the response is over , that 's a good time to analyze how the response went and decide what could have been done better , '' Kent Wells , BP senior vice president , said recently . But the broader truth seems to be that BP and the government have overcome their natural antagonism to create a functioning partnership . The two sides had testy moments , but again and again they found a path to agreement . When Allen was asked whether a recent pressure test was conceived by the government scientists or the BP engineers , he replied : `` It 's hard to say anymore , we 've been together so long . Some of these conversations start around the coffeepot . '' The government needed BP because the company had the tools to plug the hole . BP benefited from the outsider perspective of government scientists and needed officials of the Environmental Protection Agency to run interference on such contentious issues as the use of chemical dispersants , a subject on which BP was viewed as having zero credibility . Keeping everyone moving in the same direction has been Allen , perhaps the least-excitable person in American public life . Allen said in a recent interview that his goal was to `` produce unity of effort '' and added , `` You ca n't do that by polarizing , or creating conflict , or getting caught up in a personal agenda or getting too excited about things .

Thad Allen , left , and NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco release rehabilitated sea turtles off Cedar Key , Fla. , last week . -LRB- Phil Sandlin\\/associated Press -RRB- When I was a junior officer fresh out of the Coast Guard Academy in 1971 , a crusty old warrant officer told me that an idea of mine was in the `` too hard to '' do locker . The implication was that some problems are unsolvable and thus get banished to innovation purgatory . I invoked that line last May at the memorial services for retired Chief Warrant Officer Bernie Webber , who almost five decades ago accomplished what is regarded as the greatest small-boat rescue in Coast Guard history . In February 1952 Webber and his three crewmen maneuvered a surf rescue boat over the Chatham Bar on Cape Cod in gale-force winds . They rescued 33 crew members from the stern of a tanker that had broken in half in a storm . Bernie taught us all that day how to create the art of the possible where none appears to exist , and gave 33 people back their lives . He had opened the `` too hard to '' locker . Our country encountered this sort of seemingly impossible-to-open locker on April 20 . The explosion , subsequent fire and ultimate sinking of the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon led to the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . Eleven lives were lost . This summer , we watched the uncontrolled discharge of tens of thousands of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico every day . The disaster caused economic deprivation and put at risk an entire way of life . A `` fail-safe '' system had failed ; there was no human access to the source of the oil . Despite the mobilization of countless resources from the start , the response was criticized by some as inadequate and feeble . Much as Tip O'Neill told us about politics , it turns out that all oil spills are local . Yet four months later , the landscape and seascape have changed . We now know that 53,000 barrels were likely escaping each day from the well , but the well was capped on July 15 . And while nearly 5 million barrels were released into the gulf , we are beginning to understand what happened to it . We also know we mobilized the largest public - and private-sector disaster response in this nation 's history . This summer we did things that have never been done before : We employed 7,000 vessels of opportunity , a waterborne militia that has no precedent . We took control of the air space in the Gulf of Mexico to improve flight safety and more effectively employ air surveillance from the same base that defends North America from air attack . We mobilized the largest number of oil skimmers and deployed more containment boom than ever before in our country . In the process , emergency regulations authorizing the relocation of response equipment from across the country were issued in a matter of days . It was more than just marshaling forces on the water and on the shore . Nearly every agency of the government was involved , and not only the ones you would expect , such as the Coast Guard , the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , but also the Defense Department , the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Service , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and others . We stood up a special science team , led by Energy Secretary Steven Chu , who oversaw every technical aspect of the well-kill efforts . The science team also got us a precise flow rate and an oil budget that estimates where the oil went . Led by the president , the first lady and the vice president , administration officials have made more than 75 trips to the region ; all had responsibility for some portion of our response . We responded with government effort at all levels that moved beyond the tactical issue of oil on the water to address socioeconomic effects , public health , long-term environmental impact , and responsive near-term emergency services and support . Again , we have done things on a scale with no precedent . Did we learn things along the way ? We should have done some things sooner , like taking control of the airspace and transitioning from boom to skimmers . Is there more work to do ? Our estimates suggest a quarter of the oil that leaked could still be in the water . What 's left is breaking down , but that does n't mean it is n't a threat , and we wo n't stop going after it until it 's gone . Do laws and regulations need to be revised ? Do we have all the answers to long-term effects to the environment from the oil spilled or dispersants used ? Not yet , and we should not add to the cost of this spill by failing to learn these things . It has n't always been pretty , but we have opened the `` too hard to '' locker . We are poised to finish this response and move to long-term recovery . It has been one of the more consequential exercises in adapting the elements of national power together with local government and the private sector to deal with problems of unprecedented complexity . No one is claiming victory or `` mission accomplished '' at this point , nor should we . We should , however , recognize what has been done .

MMS did not write the rule . As it had dozens of times before , the agency adopted language provided by the oil industry 's trade group , the American Petroleum Institute , and incorporated it into the Federal Register . MMS received two favorable public comments about the regulation : one from the Offshore Operators Committee , an industry group , and the other from BP . The regulation stated : `` BP , a large oil and gas company , expressed the importance of this rule and how they have been involved with MMS and industry to develop the industry standard . '' The fact that BP - which has come under withering criticism for how it managed mounting pressure in the Macondo well - took partial credit for crafting the rule is not surprising . MMS has adopted at least 78 industry-generated standards as federal regulations , American Petroleum Institute records show . MMS 's acquiescence stemmed from the unusual relationship it had cultivated with industry . Directed by law to `` meet the nation 's energy needs , '' the agency pursued that mission by declaring itself publicly and formally as industry 's partner . Top officials and front-line workers routinely referred to the companies under their watch as `` clients , '' `` customers '' and especially `` partners . '' As the relationship became more intertwined , regulatory intensity subsided . MMS officials waived hundreds of environmental reviews and did not aggressively pursue companies for equipment failures . They also participated in studies financed and dominated by industry , more as collaborator than regulator . In the face of industry opposition , MMS abandoned proposals that would have increased costs but might have improved safety . The story of how a little-known federal agency became an extension of the industry it oversaw spans three decades and four presidents . It began in 1982 with a major change in the way the nation managed its natural resources , picked up pace with initiatives to streamline bureaucracy in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations , and ended after the April 20 BP blowout with the Obama administration 's abrupt decision to undo the partnership . Few in positions of power in Washington paid close attention to MMS and the hard-to-understand world it was charged with regulating . When they did , it was often to pressure the agency to increase the money it earned from leases it sold and the production that followed . Over its 28-year history , MMS grew to become one the government 's largest revenue collectors , after the Internal Revenue Service . As oil and gas companies took their drilling operations into deeper and riskier waters , MMS had to rely on its corporate partners ' expertise . Along the way were warning signs of the partnership 's imbalance , but the industry 's track record of no major accidents provided a comfort level that proved deceptive . Industry innovation , as it often does , had outrun and overpowered the government 's regulatory prowess , with disastrous results . They were partners , but they were not equals . James G. Watt , the man who created MMS , came to Washington in 1982 with a mission : to alter the way the government managed its natural resources . Coming off the hostage crisis in oil-rich Iran and gas shortages on the home front , he vowed to `` mine more '' and `` drill more . '' Nearly three decades later , the lawyer known for his sharp mind and oversized glasses says in an interview from his home in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , that he `` would n't change one decision .

Petroleum-eating bacteria - which had dined for eons on oil seeping naturally through the seafloor - proliferated in the cloud of oil that drifted underwater for months after the April 20 accident . They not only outcompeted fellow microbes , they each ramped up their own internal metabolic machinery to digest the oil as efficiently as possible . The result was a nature-made cleanup crew capable of reducing that reduced the amount of oil amounts in the undersea `` plume '' by half about every three days , according to research published online Tuesday by the journal Science . The findings , by a team of scientists led by Terry C. Hazen of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California , help explain one of the biggest mysteries a mystery of the disaster : Where has all the oil gone ? `` What we know about the degradation rates fits with what we are seeing in the last three weeks , '' Hazen said . `` We 've gone out to the sites , and we do n't find any oil , but we do find the bacteria . '' The species dominating the digestion of the oil is a newly discovered one , Hazen said . The findings point to a different conclusion from that drawn by readers of a study published last week , also in the journal Science . That research by scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute found no reduction in the oxygen content of the gigantic oil plume , suggesting that microbes were consuming the oil very slowly . The Berkeley team study published Tuesday also indicates indirectly that dispersants used to break the wellhead stream of oil into a mass of submicroscopic particles might have speeded the cleanup . By increasing the surface area between oil and water , the dispersants seem to have provided the deep-sea microbes greater access to this unusual food source . Alan Mearns , a senior staff scientist in the emergency response of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , called the Berkeley team study `` critical to the understanding of the fate of what remains in the Gulf . This study shows that microbes are quickly degrading some components of subsurface oil found in the deep ocean without creating hazardous dead zones . '' Some of the spill 's 206 million gallons of oil has come ashore , some has sunk into bottom sediments , and a little is still a floating froth . But the mile-wide , 650-foot-high oil cloud of oil that for months drifted 4,000 feet underwater seems to have disappeared in the six weeks since the well was plugged . The plume 's whereabouts has been a contentious matter . In tThe Woods Hole study , scientists described finding an undersea oil cloud June 23 to 27 similar to the one Hazen and his colleagues found between May 25 and June 2 - which was similar to one found soon after by people from the Monterey cents Bay Aquarium Research Institute .

Some time after the plumbing problem was discovered , technicians used a work-around method to try to activate the proper ram . That effort also failed to contain the well . The blowout preventer is a stack of heavy equipment that sits on the bottom of the ocean and serves as the last line of defense against a gusher . The preventer on BP 's Macondo well failed , leading to months of contamination in the gulf . BP owned the well and directed the drilling operation . The rig and the blowout preventer were under contract from Transocean . The two companies have been trying to deflect responsibility to each other . A log kept by Thierens recorded his bewilderment that the blowout preventer had been modified and noted that he had immediately met with Transocean engineer William Stringfellow Jr. and others working to choke the well : `` When I learned this news I lost all faith in this BOP stack plumbing . Billy Stringfellow , clearly emotional told me ` this stack is plumbed wrong ' , '' Thierens wrote . The plumbing issue affected efforts to jump-start the preventer using underwater robots but not the initial effort to trigger the preventer from the burning rig .

They go wall to wall in a Hilton hotel conference room , sitting at long tables that face the outnumbered investigators assigned to find the cause of the April 20 Deepwater Horizon disaster . The thermometer may be hitting 100 outside , but the room is kept perfect for the men and women in power suits , many from Washington , Chicago , New Orleans and Dallas . The investigation , a joint operation by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , is supposed to help the government determine what went wrong and recommend reforms . But the hearings have largely been taken over by lawyers for the major players in the disaster - including BP , rig owner Transocean and the contractor for the cement job , Halliburton - who are trying to prepare for what are sure to be many civil trials to come . They are generally civil to one another , but their clients have conflicting interests , with billions of dollars at stake and a Justice Department probe shadowing everything . `` The 900-pound gorilla in the room is the criminal investigation , '' said Pat Fanning , the attorney for one of the top Transocean managers on the rig . Testimony this week has focused on usual suspects : the construction of the well and maintenance of the blowout preventer . But who 's to blame , what piece of equipment or procedure proved fatally deficient , or to what degree the calamity could have been foreseen are issues the lawyers will likely tangle over for years to come . In a new twist , BP has declared that a Halliburton employee , Jesse Gagliano , who warned that the cement job on the Macondo well might not function properly , should have stopped the operation outright if he had real doubts about safety . Gagliano testified Tuesday that he told BP engineers on April 15 that if BP proceeded with the cement job as designed , it would have a gas-flow problem . Three days later , he wrote that , with only seven centralizers to center the casing , `` this well is considered to have a SEVERE gas flow problem . '' Gagliano said he and the BP engineers worked together , late into the night of April 15 , trying to resolve the problem . He recommended that BP use 21 centralizers to keep the casing properly positioned . But even though an additional 15 were flown to the rig , BP chose not to use them . The cementing job proceeded with six . Under cross-examination by BP lawyer Rick Godfrey , Gagliano acknowledged that in some documents , as well as during several conference calls with BP and Transocean managers , he did not cite the gas-flow potential or raise other alarms . `` BP had made their decision , '' Gagliano said . `` They had decided not to follow my recommendation . '' After he testified , BP released a pointed statement : `` If Halliburton had significant concerns about its ability to provide a safe and high-quality cement job in the Macondo well , then it had the responsibility and obligation to refuse to perform the job . To do otherwise would have been morally repugnant . '' News , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

Investigators cited a 2003 letter to Wells from the federal Minerals Management Service that blasted BP for `` incomplete planning , poor communication , insufficient knowledge or training , and a lack of effective supervision . '' Wells , who has been a prominent company spokesman for the technical response to the Macondo gusher , defended BP 's safety culture . `` We do n't jeopardize safety for cost , '' Wells testified . The investigators for the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -LRB- the successor agency to MMS -RRB- , who for four months have been searching for the cause of the April 20 Deepwater Horizon disaster , did not appear convinced . They asked Wells to read aloud passages from the 2003 MMS letter . At that time , Wells was a BP executive working for the shallow-water drilling operation in the gulf . Two incidents , including a blowout that caused a rig fire , had prompted an internal BP investigation , but MMS wrote that BP had blamed the equipment involved , and the contractor , rather than taking full responsibility . `` This appears to indicate that BP does not regard its required oversight of contractor operations to the level of accountability MMS desires , '' the letter states . The circumstances of the incidents `` have raised questions about the ability of BP to safely conduct drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico . '' Capt. Hung Nguyen , the board 's co-chairman , cited the 2003 incidents , a 2005 explosion at a BP facility in Texas City , Tex. , that killed 15 workers , and the Deepwater Horizon blowout , and said , `` That tells me there 's a trend there about the safety culture of BP . '' Wells said the company reformed safety practices after the earlier incidents . Texas City , he said , was `` a devastating event for us . '' ... In BP , it 's had a dramatic impact . We tried very diligently to show there 's not a conflict between safety and cost . Never should cost get in the way of doing something safely . '' For months the investigators have been concerned that it is unclear who was in charge of the Deepwater Horizon in the days and hours leading up to the April 20 explosion . BP 's senior `` company man '' on board , Ronald Sepulvado , left the rig April 16 to attend blowout-preventer classes and had only a 30-minute overlap with his replacement , Robert Kaluza . Kaluza , who has been subpoenaed but has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination , had limited experience on the Deepwater Horizon . He was involved in the fateful decision late April 20 to continue to take heavy mud out of the well and replace it with lighter seawater , despite questionable pressure-test results . Sepulvado , meanwhile , has testified that he had turned off his cellphone and did not check e-mail after leaving the rig .

BP PLC told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that it spent a total of $ 93 million on advertising from April to the end of July . The company says the money was intended to keep Gulf Coast residents informed on issues related to the oil spill and to ensure transparency about its actions . The increased spending was largely targeted at TV , newspapers and magazines . A small portion was directed to the Internet . BP said it aired fewer TV spots between April and July than during a similar period last year , but a greater percentage were on national TV and for 60 seconds instead of 30 seconds . Rep. Kathy Castor -LRB- D-Fla . -RRB- , who requested the report on BP 's spending , said Wednesday that she was disappointed that the company has spent more money `` polishing the corporate image '' than on helping Gulf Coast states recover from the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill . BP said it has made $ 89.5 million in grants to Florida , Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana to promote tourism since the spill . `` It feels like BP is overdoing it '' with its advertising , which has focused heavily on states directly affected by the oil spill , Castor said . `` It 's really making people angry . Every day , you get up and see these full-page ads in every newspaper and the TV ads . It 's really ticking people off . '' Scott Dean , a spokesman for BP , said large companies such as BP spend hundreds of millions each year to communicate about their activities and products . So far , the money spent on advertising is a relatively small proportion of BP 's total expenditures of about $ 6.1 billion relating to the oil spill , Dean said . Castor said the Gulf region was just coming out of the recession when the Deepwater Horizon blowout occurred . She called the oil spill `` a real shot in the gut '' for many businesses that depend on tourism , from hotels and restaurants to charter boat operators . BP 's ad campaign - in which U.S.-based employees vow to clean up and restore the Gulf Coast - appears to be having some effect . An Associated Press poll shows that the company 's marks for handling the oil spill more than doubled between June and August , rising to 33 percent approval among those surveyed from 15 percent in June . About 66 percent of those surveyed continue to disapprove of BP 's performance , down from 83 percent in June . `` Their ad campaign polishing the corporate image is going off like clockwork , '' Castor said . `` I wish they would do a better job of actually addressing the economic damage to my state and small-business owners .

The fire began near an oil storage tank on top of the platform about 80 miles south of Vermilion Bay , La. , while 13 workers were painting and water-blasting , forcing them to evacuate as flames engulfed the facility , according to Mariner Energy , the platform operator . A dozen of the workers were able to don brightly colored survival gear known as `` Gumby suits . '' Clinging together in the water for two hours , they drifted about a mile before they were rescued by the Crystal Clear , a supply vessel that rushed over from a rig about 25 miles away . The blaze was extinguished in the late afternoon . It did not appear that the fire triggered a crude oil leak like the one that occurred after the April 20 blowout of BP 's Macondo well . That blowout , about 200 miles east of the Mariner platform , caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history and has forced BP to set aside billions to clean up the environmental damage and compensate gulf businesses and residents . A Coast Guard official initially said that Mariner Energy , which has a history of fires and safety violations , reported an oil sheen 100 feet wide and a mile long . But Patrick Cassidy , director of investor relations for the company , later said that automated equipment on the platform had shut down its seven producing wells and that `` in an initial flyover of the facility , no oil sheen was seen on the water . '' Over the past week , the platform , in the Vermilion block 380 , had been producing 1,400 barrels a day of crude oil and 9.2 million cubic feet a day of natural gas . Nonetheless , with the Gulf Coast still reeling from the massive BP spill , the fire brought new calls for tougher regulation just as the oil industry and the White House were hoping that public concerns would abate . House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry A. Waxman -LRB- Calif. -RRB- and two other top Democrats on the committee sent a letter to Mariner Energy chief executive Scott D. Josey demanding a briefing by Sept. 10 . Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- issued a statement saying the incident shows `` that much is left to be done to keep America 's workers and waters safe from those risks . '' The Mariner Energy fire also occurred as the oil industry has been battling to stop tougher regulations in the wake of the BP accident . The American Petroleum Institute is planning to hold rallies nationwide next week to urge the Obama administration to lift its moratorium on deep-water drilling and to pressure Congress to back away from new tax and liability measures . Oil industry executives stressed the differences between the new incident and the BP blowout , but the differences also underline the magnitude of regulating the industry . The blowout that sank the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 occurred at the bottom of an exploration well in water a mile deep . Thursday 's fire began on top of a production platform in about 320 feet of water . There are just under three dozen deep-water exploration rigs in the Gulf of Mexico but thousands of shallow-water production wells . The timing of the fire overshadowed positive developments on Thursday related to the BP spill . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reopened 5,130 square miles of fisheries . NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco said it was `` another signal to tourists that the northern gulf is open for business . '' Separately , BP removed the capping stack on the Macondo well , a prerequisite for retrieving the blowout preventer that failed . Like the BP well , the Mariner Energy platform was staffed almost exclusively by workers from oil service firms . Mariner 's Cassidy said that only one of the 13 was a Mariner employee . Unlike BP , Mariner is a relatively small , independent oil and gas company . Once part of Enron , it was caught up in the financial scandal that sent Enron into bankruptcy in 2001 . A group of private equity firms led by Acon , a firm with offices in Washington , bought Mariner in March 2004 and took it public later . The company has been exploring in the gulf since 1996 , and at the end of 2009 had interests in nearly 350 federal offshore leases , with more than 110 of those in development . The company has participated in more than 35 deep-water projects . It effectively doubled the size of its operations in 2006 , when it acquired Forest Oil , including the Vermilion field . In April , Apache Energy agreed to acquire Mariner , whose shares then more than doubled . The acquisition has not been completed . On Thursday , Mariner shares fell 60 cents , or 2.57 percent , to $ 22.75 a share on a day when the broader stock market rose . According to Bloomberg News , the largest shareholder is John Paulson , a hedge fund manager known for shorting subprime mortgage derivatives through Goldman Sachs before the housing market collapse . He owned 9.7 percent of the firm at the end of June . In its 2008 annual report , Mariner said that the Vermilion 380 field was its largest in the gulf 's Outer Continental Shelf . The platform was damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008 and production was shut down for most of 2009 . Thursday 's fire is a new setback . `` We saw the fire from 20 miles away , smoke from it , '' said Dan Shaw , captain of the Crystal Clear supply boat that rescued the platform workers . As they got closer , the boat 's four-man crew saw a Coast Guard helicopter hovering over the 13 workers , a few of whom waved . Shaw said that 12 were wearing survival suits . They stayed in a pack and helped the one man without a suit . Shaw said his boat pulled alongside the group , in three-foot swells -LRB- `` a little bit lumpy , '' he said -RRB- , and a crewman hauled the 13 aboard one by one . They were dropped off at another rig about seven miles away , where they were picked up by helicopters for the trip to land . `` They were pretty calm . They were pretty tired , though . They 'd been treading water for a couple hours , '' Shaw said , speaking by satellite phone from the boat .

The 450-ton device was removed Friday afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico floor and attached to a long section of pipe that will be used to haul it 5,000 feet to the surface , according to a statement from retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the federal government 's point man on the BP oil spill . Allen said it would take 24 to 36 hours for the device to reach a rig called the Q4000 . The removal of the blowout preventer had been delayed because of high waves in the gulf , which would have put extra strain on the pipe ; it was carrying about 1 million pounds . When it is brought to shore , the device will undergo the mechanical equivalent of an autopsy . Federal investigators will take the blowout preventer apart as they try to determine why it failed to shut off the well after the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig April 20 . If the device was poorly maintained - or altered in a way that made it less effective - that could contribute to a finding of `` criminal negligence '' against BP or one of the contractors working on the rig . The investigation could also find that improperly attached pipes shot up into the device during the blowout , jamming it open . The BP well has not leaked oil since July 15 , when remote-controlled submarines sealed shut a mechanical `` cap '' that had been installed on top of the blowout preventer . The well was then filled with cement from the top . Because of that , officials said , both the blowout preventer and the cap could be removed without more oil leaking . Now , federal officials said , they plan to install a new blowout preventer . They also plan to proceed with the long-awaited `` bottom kill '' next week , sealing off the well thousands of feet below the sea floor . Also Friday , the federal government reopened 3,114 square miles off the Florida panhandle to fishing , following seafood testing , officials said . Seventeen 17 percent of U.S. gulf waters remain closed , down from 37 percent during the height of the spill . BP said it has spent $ 8 billion on the spill , including the costs of cleaning up the oil , capping the well and paying compensation claims . It has also set aside $ 20 billion for claims in an escrow account , under the supervision of Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg . And the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement - the successor to the beleaguered Minerals Management Service - said it was launching an investigation into a fire at another offshore facility Thursday . The fire , at Mariner Energy 's Vermilion 380 production platform , caused 13 crew members to jump overboard . Federal officials did not release details Friday about the cause . All of the crew members were rescued unhurt , and there was no significant oil spill from the damaged platform . A Coast Guard overflight Friday noted only a `` light rainbow sheen '' on the water , believed to be oily residue washed overboard during fire-fighting .

BP 's internal report on the disaster emphasizes `` shared responsibility . '' -LRB- U.s. Coast Guard Via Associated Press -RRB- BP rolled out the results Wednesday of a four-month internal investigation into the causes of the April 20 blowout of its Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , spreading blame among its contractors and giving a glimpse of the defenses it might deploy in public and in court . The much-anticipated report asserted that a `` complex and interlinked series '' of failures - of equipment , engineering and judgment - led to the surge of oil and gas that exploded on the deck of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , killing 11 people , sinking the rig and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history . The report was written by a team of 50 internal and external experts led by the company 's head of safety and operations , Mark Bly , and the rollout Wednesday morning at a hotel in downtown Washington was labeled a `` technical briefing . '' But the document inevitably carries a heavy public relations element as well as legal and financial implications for BP . It arrives as the Justice Department is weighing whether to bring charges of criminal negligence against BP that could sharply increase the cost of the spill for the London-based oil giant and provide fodder for private lawsuits . In addition , there is legislation in Congress that would effectively strip BP of the right to drill in the Gulf of Mexico . The company is haggling with the Obama administration over what pieces of collateral to offer while it is financing the $ 20 billion escrow fund that will be used to pay claims . And BP 's main partner in the well , Anadarko Petroleum , has declared that it wo n't pay its share of the cleanup costs and claims because it views BP 's well design and actions as reckless . The BP report makes the case for `` shared responsibility , '' saying that `` no single factor '' caused the blowout . It points to multiple failures by its contractors in maintenance , equipment and planning . The investigation found fault with the recipe Halliburton used in its cement , with the flaps on a Weatherford International barrier device known as a float collar , and with the condition of hydraulic lines and batteries that might have sapped power from the blowout preventer made by Cameron International and operated by Transocean , making it impossible to clamp and cut through steel piping . `` Transocean was solely responsible for operation of the drilling rig and for operations safety , '' the report says in an appendix . `` It was required to maintain well control equipment and use all reasonable means to control and prevent fire and blowouts . '' The report also said Transocean and BP rig leaders jointly `` reached the incorrect view '' on well tests in the crucial hours before the explosion . And Bly said BP needs to reexamine the way it oversees work by its contractors . Yet the report absolves BP 's widely criticized well design . It says the path that oil and gas followed as they escaped from the well meant that the well 's casing and design - matters that could otherwise implicate BP - were not factors in the disaster . Instead , it says that if any one of eight failures of equipment or decision-making had not taken place , the blowout would not have happened . The report not only offers new details and analysis of what went wrong , it also represents a bold declaration that BP is not going to assume more than what it considers its share of the blame for the accident . The report did not say how far up the BP corporate ladder the well problems went , and no employee was named or punished . In a news release , BP chief executive Tony Hayward , who has barely spoken publicly since his disastrous congressional testimony in June , did not offer anything resembling a mea culpa .

That 's not how it reads . The company that owns the lease to the Macondo well identified eight critical failures that led to the blowout and explosion that sunk the rig . Of those , Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- argued , only partially exaggerating , BP takes explicit responsibility for only half of one . Investigators reckon that the disaster began with an inadequate cement seal ; the cement `` slurry '' that oil services contractor Halliburton used did not prevent oil and gas from entering the well . An anomalous pressure test indicating that the well was n't sealed should have alerted rig workers , including BP 's . But they misinterpreted the results . Once oil and gas began surging to the surface , BP says , workers from rig owner Transocean should have taken different steps to contain them . Finally , Transocean 's blowout preventer failed to shut off the flow . Critically , BP insists that its much-criticized well design was n't a problem . That 's angered Transocean , which also points out that BP declined to run a `` cement bond log '' to test the integrity of the cement job . Which is to say , other ongoing investigations must assess BP 's account . The thrust of the narrative is n't necessarily wrong . The accident probably did result from a series of errors that ca n't be assigned to one actor . This makes sense , since the concurrent failure of redundant safety systems does n't lend itself to neat explanation and easy assignment of blame . Even so , the report has to be understood in light of the company 's possible legal liability , a question that it avoids addressing , and the popular perception that this was `` the BP oil spill . '' At least as far as the latter is concerned , it 's worth remembering that BP had the responsibility to successfully monitor the operations onboard the Deepwater Horizon , including the cement job . The report admits this . As The Post 's Joel Achenbach noted , what BP 's investigators do n't do is give a full explanation of motivation : Were BP and its contractors rushing the job to save money ? For that , for answers to the legal liability question and for confirmation of BP 's narrative , the public will have to wait for independent investigations to conclude , including the presidentially chartered inquiry and a Justice Department probe . Outstanding investigations also must more fully examine the role of government regulators .

But BP 's voluminous report on the causes of the April 20 explosion in the Gulf of Mexico on the Deepwater Horizon rig does not include information brought to light in other investigations highlighting actions that might save time or money . One example involves BP 's use of a gooey chemical mixture in the well during a pivotal pressure test that preceded the blowout . The report says that the mixture could have clogged a line involved in the test , masking the fact that hydrocarbons were flowing into the well . The material that went into the mixture - more than 400 barrels of products called Form-A-Set and Form-A-Squeeze - was left over on the rig after the well drilling . The material was designed to plug leaks , such as cracks in rock formations . Under environmental protection standards , if BP used the leftover material in the well , it could then dump the product directly into the gulf instead of transporting it to shore for disposal as hazardous waste , Leo Lindner , a drilling fluid specialist for contractor M-I SWACO , testified at a federal hearing in July . During the April 20 pressure test , BP used it as a `` spacer '' to separate seawater from dense drilling fluid called `` mud '' in a column of fluids pumped into the well . `` They did n't want to have to dispose of them , '' Lindner said of the leftover Form-A-Set and Form-A-Squeeze .

BP 's Macondo oil well is physically incapable of leaking another drop , according to the head of the U.S. government 's response effort . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen said Friday that this discovery was made after a `` relief well '' finally broke through into the Macondo well more than 17,000 feet below the Gulf of Mexico floor . `` The well presents no further threat of discharge , '' Allen said . But just to be sure , BP plugged it a little bit more . About 4 p.m. Friday , authorities began the long-awaited - and now , rather anti-climactic - `` bottom kill , '' filling in that empty space with cement . The cement should be set by Saturday afternoon , Allen said , and a final pressure test will allow the declaration of death . After the American people spent the summer watching the fearsome oil well spill , Allen said this last step was as much for our benefit as it was for the gulf 's . He said the intent was `` psychologically , for people in the gulf to understand that there is a stake in the heart of this beast . '' BP 's well spent about three months repelling all attempts to kill it - eventually spilling 4.9 million barrels , or 205.8 million gallons , into the gulf . Then , it spent the next two months dying : The well was sealed off July 15 , and cement was forced down its central pipe in a so-called `` static kill '' in early August . Through it all , a rig in the gulf was slowly drilling down to provide the final nail in its coffin . The relief well 's progress was slowed by passing storms - which made the gulf too choppy - but also by the depth of its target . Drilling began on the gulf floor a mile down and continued for another 2.4 miles into the earth . Finally , on Thursday afternoon , the drill hit its target , a seven-inch shaft . It opened a hole into the space between the shaft 's wall and the outer layer of pipe . There was no camera recording it , but engineers could learn about the outer space around the Macondo well pipe by studying fluid that rose from the other well 's drill pipe . When no oil came up , they knew that the Macondo well was plugged at its source . That was a good thing for the gulf . But it could also be a good thing for BP 's legal case , because it could be a signal that the blowout was not caused by a problem with BP 's design for the well 's pipes .

The flow rate of the blown-out well sparked great controversy at the height of the crisis . The Coast Guard initially pegged the leak at 1,000 barrels a day , then upped that to 5,000 barrels , using both government and BP estimates . But the actual rate initially was 62,000 barrels a day , according to scientists in the government-backed Flow Rate Technical Group . A persistent question is whether BP and the Coast Guard calibrated their initial response plans , at the surface and at the sea floor , to handle the smaller amount of gushing oil . Representatives of both , appearing Monday at a commission hearing at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel , denied that they made such a mistake , saying they went all-out with every available resource . `` We literally threw everything at it , '' said Doug Suttles , BP chief operating officer for exploration and production . Coast Guard Capt. Edwin Stanton echoed those remarks . But Graham said at the news conference that the commission has information suggesting that some of the deep-sea technology used to fight the leak , such as the `` top hat '' containment cap , was premised on a smaller flow . There was also new information on how the erroneous flow estimate came to be early in the crisis . Ian MacDonald , a Florida State University physical oceanographer , testified Monday that BP 's Regional Oil Spill Response Plan , a 567-page document dated 2008 that covers the Gulf of Mexico and is famous for its provision for saving walruses that do not live in the gulf , contains an incorrect statistical formula for estimating the size of a spill . The formula in the BP plan underestimates the thickness of black oil on the surface of the sea by a hundredfold , MacDonald said . As a result , BP 's `` best guess '' for the leak as of April 27 was 5,768 barrels , close to the 5,000-barrel estimate initially produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . MacDonald made headlines early in the crisis when he said that his own scrutiny of satellite images of the slick produced a leak estimate of 26,000 barrels a day minimum . He told reporters Monday that he did not take evaporation into account , and thus the real flow had to be higher yet . MacDonald said that most of the oil remains in the gulf . This oil `` is a highly durable material that resists further dissipation , '' MacDonald concluded . Referring to the spill as a kind of uncontrolled experiment , he wrote in his prepared testimony that there could be long-term damage to productivity and biodiversity in the gulf : '' -LRB- W -RRB- e must remember that this experiment was performed on an ecosystem that was already badly damaged '' by overfishing , coastal runoff and low oxygen levels . Doug Inkley , senior scientist with the National Wildlife Federation , said in a written statement citing MacDonald 's findings , `` From Day One , BP and the government have lowballed the volume of the oil in the water and minimized the current and future impacts of this disaster .

Graham pressed on : Why was there a gap between what BP said it would do and what it could actually deliver in a spill ? Suttles : `` It 's hard for me to go back in time and understand what people were thinking at the time . '' He said no one anticipated a well that would flow for weeks on end at `` significant rates . '' Now , however , the company has systems that have been developed since the April 20 blowout that could be applied to other deep-water wells . Graham : `` Do you think that now your company can live up to the permit representations that it made as to its ability to respond ? '' Suttles : `` I think what 's been clear is that we have demonstrated that we can contain uncontrolled flow in this particular well ... What we need to do is see about how adaptable is that current capability to all the situations across the Gulf of Mexico . '' Suttles at one point conceded that little investment had been made by the industry in developing technology for fighting spills . `` Some of the tools and techniques available to use were the same ones available 20 years ago , '' Suttles said . A top administration official said Monday that drilling is unlikely to resume immediately because of new safety requirements devised by regulators since the April 20 blowout . `` Even when the moratorium is lifted , you 're not going to see drilling going on the next day or even the next week , '' said Michael Bromwich , head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement . Such remarks signal , potentially , an early lifting of the moratorium , which is set to expire Nov. 30 . Bromwich plans to deliver a report with recommendations on deep-water drilling regulations later this week , and that could set the stage for the administration to reopen the deep gulf to the kind of exploratory drilling that went awry on the Deepwater Horizon .

Dudley , an American who formally takes over the London-based oil giant Friday , also said he would elevate the company 's safety chief , Mark Bly , the author of the recent report on the Macondo well blowout , and give him broader powers over the company 's worldwide operations . Andy Inglis , BP 's head of global exploration and production , will leave the company at the end of the year and lose his seat on the company 's board of directors effective Oct. 31 . A graduate of Cambridge University , he joined BP 30 years ago . The moves are the first management changes since chief executive Tony Hayward announced in late July that he would step down effective Oct. 1 . They are designed to address widespread criticism of BP for failing to identify or punish key decision makers in the blowout . `` These are the first and most urgent steps in a program I am putting in place to rebuild trust in BP - the trust of our customers , of governments , of our employees and of the world at large , '' Dudley said in a statement . BP has also come under criticism for the Bly report , which a senior executive from another major oil company , speaking on condition of anonymity to protect his business relationships , said was `` devoid of the human factor . '' The human factor played a key role , experts and oil executives say , because senior people on the rig , including BP and Transocean employees , failed to respond to multiple signs that oil and gas were leaking into the well after it was supposed to have been sealed . Bly will report directly to Dudley , and his safety division will have employees embedded in all of BP 's operations , the company said . Inglis will be replaced by three executive vice presidents : Mike Daly heading exploration , Bernard Looney in charge of development and Bob Fryar responsible for production . Together with Andy Hopwood , who becomes executive vice president for strategy and integration , they will join an expanded top management team reporting directly to Dudley .

On Friday , 11 weeks after the runaway well was capped July 15 , Allen announced that the `` national incident command '' was being dismantled .

METAIRIE , LA. - The BP oil spill cleanup is winding down , but the lawyers are just warming up . The gusher of litigation might not be capped for years . At a Holiday Inn near the freeway here , a conference room was packed Tuesday with some big lumber from the legal profession . The lawyers represented oil giant BP , Transocean , Halliburton , Cameron , Anadarko , Weatherford , Dril-Quip , M-I Swaco , Sperry Sun and some of the survivors of the Deepwater Horizon disaster . This is the latest set of hearings by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , which have been investigating the April 20 blowout that killed 11 people . The marine board will write a report and make recommendations for improved safety and regulations . For the lawyers , this is all material for the trials and lawsuits yet to come . More than 300 lawsuits reportedly have been filed against BP , but that 's only one part of the legal story . The companies involved with the Deepwater Horizon disaster are likely to sue one another , though so far they 've mostly battled via news releases and stinging quotes from the corporate communications departments . Meanwhile , the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation . `` There are the injury-death cases ; there 's the stockholder cases ; there 's the environmental cases ; there 's the economic loss cases ; and all the government cases , '' said lawyer Ronnie Penton , who has multiple clients who have filed suit against BP and who specializes in injury-death litigation . `` It could go on for 10 years , '' said Kyle Schonekas , attorney for the sunken rig 's captain , Curt Kuchta of Transocean . Schonekas provided the day 's highlight-reel performance . The co-chairman of the investigative panel , Coast Guard Capt. Hung Nguyen , had been asking many witnesses about Kuchta 's actions immediately after the explosion , focusing on whether Kuchta was fully in command of the situation . Finally , Schonekas leapt to his feet and loudly declared , `` This is nothing more than an effort , continually by Captain Nguyen , to character assassinate my client . '' He then made a motion to have Nguyen recuse himself because of his `` bias . '' Nguyen did not respond . The board member running the proceeding , retired federal judge Wayne Andersen , quickly denied the motion . There were other squalls in the windowless Magnolia Room on this unseasonably cool day in New Orleans . At one point in the morning , Nguyen chided Transocean , the rig 's owner , for what he said was a persistent unwillingness to produce witnesses and documents . Nguyen directed a Coast Guard aide to place five enlarged documents on an easel at the front of the room . Nguyen said the documents indicated that senior Transocean executives knew that some company rigs had questionable safety records . `` To me , Transocean has not been responsive to the requests of this board , '' Nguyen said .

'' The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released four `` working papers '' Wednesday that said the administration 's response was marked by confusion about the spill rate , slowing the federal effort immediately after the oil exploration well blew out April 20 . The commission staff 's preliminary papers also said that Obama 's Office of Management and Budget later delayed a report by government scientists that would have included a `` worst-case '' estimate of the rate of the spill , weeks before the government revised its own official estimates upward . The reports delivered a harsh assessment of the administration 's later contention that most of the spill was `` gone . '' They point to comments by Carol M. Browner , Obama 's climate and energy czar , who in a television interview mischaracterized a report as saying that three-quarters of the spill had disappeared . The White House responded Wednesday by saying that confusion about numbers had not hindered its response to the spill . The federal effort `` was full force and immediate , and the response focused on state and local plans and evolved when needed , '' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration head Jane Lubchenco and OMB Acting Director Jeffrey Zients said in a statement . Moreover , an OMB spokesman said that the agency was not trying to hide the gravity of the spill and that NOAA 's report , which was focused on the spill 's shore impact , was sent for revisions for reasons having nothing to do with the flow rate . `` The issue was the modeling , the science and the assumptions they were using to come up with their analysis . Not public relations or presentation , '' said Kenneth Baer , OMB 's spokesman . `` We offered NOAA suggestions of ways to improve their analysis , and they happily accepted it . '' The White House added that senior government officials were publicly clear about how bad the spill might get : `` In early May , -LRB- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar -RRB- and Admiral Thad Allen told the American people that the worst-case scenario could be more than 100,000 barrels a day . In addition , BP reported in 2009 that a blowout of the Deepwater Horizon -LRB- MC 252 -RRB- could yield 162,000 barrels of oil a day . '' But transcripts show that Salazar and Allen , who oversaw the government 's disaster response , were referring to a more catastrophic type of blowout that never occurred , while BP 's 2009 figures were hypothetical and not based on observations after the spill began . The commission 's analysis raises questions about two key promises of the Obama administration - that its response to the spill would reflect its commitments to rigorous science and to government transparency . `` Federal government responders may be correct in stating that low flow-rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations , '' said one of the commission 's working papers . `` Even if responders are correct , however , loss of the public 's trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem .

Case studies are all well and good , but the presidential group 's reports of what went wrong with the decision making amid the government 's response read like one of the most instructive business case studies I 've seen in a long time . The working papers , released Oct. 6 , reveal a poorly managed response , a delay of the release of information about the spill 's worst-case scenario , and confusion about the severity of the spill . They offer a rare comprehensive look at decision-making in a crisis that is immediate , highly detailed and even harsh in its assessment . The average case study is none of those things . Among the findings of the commission : agencies differed over how to describe the spill publicly as its immensity became better understood ; studying the fate of the spilled oil was not `` peer reviewed , '' as some officials had stated ; and a `` lack of regulatory guidance '' contributed to the confusion . But it is the decision-making problems that will resonate most with leaders , no matter whether they lead a corporate office , a government agency or a non-profit organization . The `` Decision-Making Within the Unified Command '' report places significant blame on a circumvented command structure , in which `` inter-agency groups were activated but later marginalized '' while top agency chiefs , who were often political appointees , `` remained very involved in the response and took over addressing key issues . '' While that might have helped with image management , the report notes , it injected politics where it was n't needed . `` Such involvement may have increased accountability , and helped to make controversial decision-making more transparent , but it also made the decisions more subject to criticism and delay on political grounds , '' the report notes . Likewise , the established response teams became , as the working papers call them , `` report-to '' bodies rather than `` decision-making '' teams . That bypass of the traditional structure made it confusing to the public and to responders where authority lay . In the flap over using dispersants to clear the oil , for instance , political appointees who had not been part of earlier analyses were suddenly making decisions despite a lack of knowledge . In other words , the government suffered from the classic traps of micro-management and too much centralization . As the report states , `` much of the unified command structure is designed to push issues down to the most local level at which they can be addressed . Having strong agency head participation tended to elevate decisions that might have otherwise been addressed closer to the source of the question , '' where , presumably , the amount of knowledge was greater . A weakened presidency , heightened national political tensions and the magnitude of the spill all contributed to decision-making meddling from higher-ups . But any organization in crisis often faces the same risk : top executives want to look like they 're taking swift action , when really the best course might be simply letting go . The temptation for leaders to wade in -- no pun intended -- and micro-manage during a crisis blurs decision-making structures , confuses front-line workers and slows down action as everyone waits to see what the higher-ups want now that the traditional process has been shattered . In a crisis , leaders would be wise to remember that the best way to burnish their image as a take-action chief is to get the crisis solved .

As dismal as all of this is , it seems to me it REALLY operates -LRB- whether `` wittingly '' or not makes no real difference -RRB- as a diversionary deflection of attention AWAY from what is perhaps the GREATEST actual damage of the whole fiasco -- which is all the METHANE released into the environment as a consequence of the gusher that took three months to finally cap . The `` whole ` nother dimension '' of this spill that DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PICKED UP ON IN THE GENERAL POPULAR CONSCIOUSNESS -- and I m afraid that IT SURELY OUGHT TO BE . I refer to all the METHANE that PRESSURIZED the flow of this gusher to the extent of having DRIVEN that whole spill of 4.9 million barrels of oil . I have heard one figure stated that 40 % of that was methane -LRB- and no , I don t know whether that was by weight or by volume -- or whether at those pressures and temperatures it even makes any difference -RRB- . I point out to people that methane -LRB- CH4 -RRB- is a VERY `` EFFICACIOUS '' GREENHOUSE GAS ! -LRB- meaning , of course , that IT TOO , just like the CO2 about which many folks now generally understand , operates like a `` blanket '' that `` holds in '' the energy of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun , photons of which EASILY PASS THROUGH the atmosphere COMING IN , but then interact with the atoms of the Earth that they eventually strike and end up driving rebound re-radiation of LOWER FREQUENCY photons of INFRA-RED energy . To THESE , such gases are OPAQUE , so that the resulting `` heat '' energy CAN NOT THEN RE-RADIATE FREELY BACK OFF OUT INTO SPACE -- so it `` PILES UP '' , and THE EARTH GETS HOTTER ! -RRB- But CO2 is NOT THE ONLY such `` greenhouse gas '' ; METHANE is evidently MUCH WORSE than CO2 ! Furthermore , lest people imagine that it too -LRB- like the OIL -RRB- has been dispersed into the water , BE ADVISED : METHANE IS NOT WATER-SOLUBLE ! Presumably however much of it has been released I WOULD THINK MUST HAVE BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER AND , except for perhaps 10 % or so of everything that was burned off , MUST HAVE NOW GONE OFF INTO THE AIR !! `` We '' LONG ago already realized that this stuff -LRB- being FLAMMABLE , and indeed EXPLOSIVE -RRB- needed to be `` disposed of '' . And years ago one would see FLARES burning in the vicinity of oil refineries -- which at least served to `` convert '' methane into carbon dioxide , which IS NOT flammable and explosive . We do n't do THAT any longer -LRB- at least not on LAND , in `` developed '' countries -RRB- ; rather `` we '' CAPTURE the stuff . -LRB- It is USEFUL AS A FUEL ! -RRB- And indeed , nowadays every lousy LANDFILL is outfitted with a system of gas-collection wells to CAPTURE the methane that is inevitably given off in the course of the decomposition of complex organic material . -LRB- I have seen one figure suggesting that where methane IS FLARED to CO2 the relative benefit vis - - vis the greenhouse effect is as much as 96 % . So do the math ! With respect to computation of a tons of CO2 emitted EQUIVALENT , the efficacy ratio MUST BE ABOUT 25 TO 1 !! -RRB- But EVIDENTLY NOBODY EVEN BOTHERS TO THINK ABOUT THAT ! BP originated in 1908 as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a British corporation whose name was changed to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company . With exclusive rights to extract , refine , export , and sell Iran 's rich oil resources , the company reaped enormous profits . Mohammed Mossadeq , the prime minister signed legislation , to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company . The British government was horrified and imposed an economic embargo on Iran . When this failed to bring the Iranians to heel , the British government sought to arrange for the overthrow of Mossadeq . The CIA was placed in charge of an operation , including fomenting riots and other destabilizing activities , to overthrow Mossadeq and advance oil company interests in Iran . Start with the simple truth that the government at every level is not prepared to deal with the sort of event we saw in the Gulf . To have those assets available would have required taxing energy companies and we know how that would have worked : not at all . Unlike the Katrina fiasco , government was not charged with being the responder to the Macondo spill . Was the administration superb in how it did respond ? No , but there is n't a simple check list to follow in such situations . As for the deal struck with BP , of course it has its benefits for BP , but that does not mean that it did not give those with claims some traction in how they will be compensated . I 'm weary of all this enemy-finding . Why ca n't we figure out that we are all in this together and just argue about real differences of how to improve our nation rather than ranting at each other ? Obama placed his entire Administration at the disposal of the bloody British propaganda machine . The Keystone Kop Brigade was led by Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen . Allen made former FEMA Director Michael Brown look like a genius and the hero of Katrina , with help from Lisa P. Jackson of the EPA , Ken Salazar of the Dept. of the Interior and Jane Lubchenco of NOAA . The working papers , released Oct. 6 , do not reveal a poorly managed response , a delay of the release of information about the spill 's worst-case scenario , and confusion about the severity of the spill . This was the worst political cover-up since Watergate . Shortly after the well explosion killing 11 oil workers , BP began applying vast quantities of chemical dispersants . By mid-July , BP had released almost two million gallons of the deadly dispersant Corexit with the blessings of the EPA . Other CPAs have checked the math . It is abridged to fit this space . When I first learned of the `` settlement '' BP agreed to this morning at the White House , I could n't believe any Company would agree to the terms , particularly the agreement to compensate rig workers laid off because of the Obama ban on drilling . But then I learned that the $ 20 billion escrow fund will be funded over 4 years with only $ 7 billion paid out in 2010 . Since Oil Companies focus principally on cash flow , I started analyzing the cash flow aspects of the settlement . I feel quite certain the BP 's US operations are conducted through a US subsidiary which files a US tax return for operations conducted under this legal umbrella . First of all , based on the announcement , BP 's funding of the escrow account is voluntary . There apparently is no legal basis for enforcement . However , generally accepted accounting principles -LRB- GAP -RRB- requires BP to book the $ 20 billion accepted liability in the year incurred - 2010 . As such BP can claim a $ 20 billion deduction on its US 2010 tax return and collect refunds from the US government of some $ 7 billion in 2011 , either on its 2010 tax return or through loss carry backs to 2005 through 2009 , obtaining tax refunds paid in those years . BP will pay no quarterly dividends for Q2 - Q4 2010 saving some $ 7.5 billion in cash flow . About 40 % of these dividends are paid to US residents or some $ 3 billion . If this income is distributed to taxpayers , the US government revenues will be reduced by at least 15 to 35 % of the taxable amount . So let 's analyze the cash flow impact on BP in 2010 : Escrow funding -LRB- $ 7,000,000,000 -RRB- Meanwhile the US government 's cash flow will look like this : Net unfavorable cash flow -LRB- $ 8,000,000,000 -RRB- So now BP is going to be in a net favorable cash flow position until sometime in 2012 when it should be clearer what its exposure is , putting it in a good position -LRB- i.e. without any net cash outflow -RRB- to decide whether to fold its US operations through a bankruptcy . The liability for the balance of the escrow will be unsecured with no preference over other creditors , so the balance of the $ 20 billion may never be paid . In the interim you can believe that there will be no advances to or investment in the US opoperations by its parent and every opportunity will be taken to repay any amounts owed to the parent . In the meantime , BP can claim credit for being a responsible Corporate citizen and will have put a stop , albeit perhaps only temporarily , to the daily pillorying by the media and politicians .

The spill is estimated at more than 4 million barrels -LRB- 168 million gallons -RRB- , not 4 million gallons . At BP , safety vs. cost-saving Investigator Jason Mathews says a review found that BP employee evaluations documented ways they had saved the company money . -LRB- Patrick Semansky -RRB- METAIRIE , LA. - There 's been a lot of talk about the `` safety culture '' at BP in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . Now , federal investigators are probing what looks to them like BP 's save-money culture . At a federal hearing this week , an investigator revealed that BP 's top manager on a drilling rig is given a performance evaluation that includes the category `` Every Dollar Counts and Simplification . '' Of 13 employee evaluations reviewed by investigators , 12 had documented ways they had saved the company large sums of money , typically six-figure amounts , and one had put together a spreadsheet showing that he could account for $ 490,000 in savings , said Jason Mathews , an investigator for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , which is conducting the joint inquiry with the Coast Guard . BP witnesses have acknowledged this week and in previous hearings that oil drilling is a business , and costs have to be taken into account . But they 've said safety always comes first , and they denied compromising safety to save money . The government this week raised the question of whether BP took incremental shortcuts because it felt rushed to finish the problem-plagued Macondo exploration well , a job costing BP about a million dollars a day . Simply leasing the Deepwater Horizon rig from Transocean was costing $ 525,000 a day . Eleven people died when the mile-deep well blew out April 20 , and more than 4 million gallons of oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico in the nation 's worst offshore oil spill . One document introduced into evidence this week showed that the Macondo job , originally projected as a $ 96 million operation , was on track to cost $ 58 million more than anticipated . BP kept track of estimated completion dates for drilling jobs , and tried to figure out where the rig could go next so that it could stay active and have minimal down time . E-mails discussed by attorneys this week showed that BP hoped to squeeze in a quick job in May - plugging a well called Nile - before tackling a more complex job at another site , the Kaskida well , that might take six months . Mathews asked John Guide , the BP well team leader for the Macondo job , whether cost-consciousness colored decisions involving safety . `` No sir , '' Guide answered . He added : `` It is a business , so yes , there is consideration for monetary things . But like I said before , even though you could phrase it that way , safety was always the Number 1 priority . Safety was never compromised in the operation . '' Also testifying this week for the first time was a key BP engineer , Gregory Walz , the engineering team leader for the Macondo well . Walz participated in some of the most critical decisions regarding the cement job , which BP 's own internal investigation has cited as a major factor in the blowout . Notes from BP 's internal interview with Walz on July 29 were discussed at the hearing Thursday . Walz told the BP investigators that they were concerned about using only six centralizers to position the casing prior to the cement job , but thought they could mitigate any potential `` channeling '' by repositioning the centralizers and using a less-dense , nitrogen-foamed cement recipe . Walz had a `` brief discussion '' with Guide about a Halliburton model showing that there could be a `` severe '' gas flow problem in the well if only six centralizers were used , but `` they had a foamed cement slurry which was designed to protect against gas migration , '' the BP internal notes say . Walz thought that 15 additional centralizers that he 'd ordered flown to the rig had turned out to be the wrong type and would create potential mechanical problems in the completion of the well . According to the BP notes , Guide and Walz `` did not discuss stopping and ordering the correct style of centralizer . '' BP 's internal inquiry , released in September , said the 15 additional centralizers were the correct style after all . As a backup - a contingency if they had signs of a bad cement job - the BP well team decided it could run a test called a cement bond log . Walz testified that the well team followed an established `` decision tree '' when it came time to decide whether to run that test . When the first analysis of the cement job looked positive , including no signs of mud being lost in the well , Guide said in a conference call that he saw no reason to run the test , and Walz and other participants in the call concurred , according to Walz in his BP interview . BP would have had to pay a contractor , Schlumberger , about $ 128,000 to run the test that would have taken 12 to 18 hours if there had been no problems , Guide testified . But BP decided to forgo the test and the Schlumberger workers left the rig on a helicopter the morning of April 20 . `` Based on the information I had at the time , I felt we acted properly , '' Walz testified . Eleven hours after the Schlumberger workers left the rig , the well erupted .

The day 's topic was the economy , but a concerned questioner rose after the speech to ask about the thinking behind his new drilling decree . Obama 's expansive answer included a revealing aside about his confidence in the safety of offshore operations . `` It turns out , by the way , the oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills , '' the president told the questioner , a man from Charlotte . `` They are technologically very advanced . Even during Katrina , the spills did n't come from the rigs . '' It was 18 days before BP 's Macondo well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , killing 11 and leading Obama to halt new deep-water drilling under the just-lifted temporary ban - 18 days before the men calling the shots on the BP rig would demolish Obama 's assurances about the safety of extracting oil from depths no one had fathomed only 20 years ago . For Obama , it was still a time to trumpet his policy . He cast it as one forged from science and study , the product of a lengthy , robust assessment led by his interior secretary , Ken Salazar . `` This is not a decision I 've made lightly , '' the president said in his March 31 announcement at Andrews Air Force Base . `` It is one that Ken - Secretary Salazar - and I , as well as Carol Browner , my energy adviser , and others in my administration looked at closely for more than a year . But the bottom line is this : Given our energy needs ... we are going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable , homegrown energy . '' The moment was vintage Obama - emphasizing his zest for inquiry , his personal involvement , his willingness to make the tough call , his search for middle ground . If an Obama brand exists , it is his image as a probing , cerebral president conducting an exhaustive analysis of the issues so that the best ideas can emerge , and triumph . Two months later , in his June 15 speech to the nation about the blowout , Obama would fault the decision-making process he had earlier lauded as careful and collaborative . Not only had something gone wrong in the gulf , he would suggest - but something had also gone wrong at the White House , and at the Interior Department . `` I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs , '' he said , `` but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deep-water drilling to continue . '' How had this happened ? How had Obama - the man who came into office promising a rigorous , evidence-based post-partisan style of analysis - come to believe that he lacked the facts he needed to make such an important decision ? It was more than bad luck and bad timing . This article , based on dozens of interviews with people directly involved , reveals that fundamental questions were n't pursued because top administration officials generally accepted the conventional view of the industry 's safety record . They were focused on the environmental issues - how drilling and a possible spill would affect sensitive habitats - and not on the engineering risks of exploration . Few studies existed on the technological challenges involved in pursuing oil and gas in ever-deeper waters . The law required Interior Department officials to make an environmental assessment ; it did not require a comparable examination of engineering questions or safety concerns . Salazar 's 14-month review had concentrated mostly on where , not whether , exploration should be allowed . Politics factored into his recommendations as he took into account which states wanted more drilling and which would resist it .

Six months after the spill , BP 's money is changing the gulf as much as its oil Wednesday , October 20 , 2010 ; 12:55 AM VENICE , LA. -- The oil has mostly disappeared . And in southern Louisiana , things are finally looking normal - improbably , blessedly normal - six months after the largest oil spill in U.S. history . But on a truly normal evening , Acy Cooper Jr. would be out shrimping . Instead , one recent night , he was staying home , as he has done more often these days . It do n't pay me to do that when they 're going to pay my claim anyway , '' said Cooper , vice president of the state 's shrimpers association . Today , it is BP 's money , not its oil , that is most visibly altering the Gulf Coast . The company has been trying - on federal orders - to protect not just the water but the way of life there . But BP 's waterfall of cash has changed people 's lives profoundly . The oil company has already paid out $ 965 million and set aside $ 20 billion in a separate compensation fund . The money has been welcomed as a lifeline . But it has made the coast feel like an open-air economic experiment : Some hardworking fishermen think it 's in their best interest to be idle , losing market share they will need next year . And those who have n't been paid are looking for legal and illegal ways to work the system . Kenneth R. Feinberg , whom President Obama chose as compensation czar , says fishermen such as Cooper are wrong to believe he will pay them not to shrimp . They will be compensated for the time they could n't fish , but `` if a shrimper has the ability to earn a livelihood , there is no longer a need for an emergency payment , '' he said . Across the coast , Feinberg said , people are already seeing the limits of what money - even an oil company 's massive amount of money - can do to right an environmental wrong . `` I told 9\\/11 victims when they said , ` Bring back my wife , or my son or my daughter ' - ' I ca n't do that , ' '' said Feinberg , who also oversaw compensation payouts to victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . `` I ca n't compensate you in the gulf for a way of life that goes back 100 years . I can only compensate you for financial damages . '' And keeping up with that process is proving more difficult by the day . A few weeks ago , Feinberg 's fund adopted new policies that paid claims faster and more generously . The result : The rate of new claims doubled , Feinberg said . `` People see that their next-door neighbor is getting paid , '' he said . So they say , `` Why do n't we submit a claim ? '' It has been half a year since April 20 , when an explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 men . Two days later , the rig 's sinking set off a gray-brown geyser of crude oil , which eventually spewed 4.9 million barrels -LRB- 205.8 million gallons -RRB- , about 19 times more than the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 . Scientists are still trying to measure the spill 's full impact on the gulf . Little oil remains on the water 's surface , and the toll of about 6,100 birds and 600 turtles was just a fraction of the animal deaths in the Alaska spill . There are continuing concerns about what 's happening on the seafloor . But it is already clear that this was not Valdez .

The Center for Biological Diversity filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Friday , charging that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement and `` provide the public with relevant environmental information on the effects of commencing drilling . '' A group of oil and gas company representatives met with top Interior officials a day earlier to lobby for faster offshore drilling permitting along with the creation of a new Ocean Safety Institute under the Interior Department that would be a public and private partnership and focus on rig safety , spill containment and spill cleanup . The American Petroleum Institute , Chevron , Transocean , Exxon Mobil , Conoco Phillips , BP , Shell Oil , Diamond Offshore and Hercules were represented . Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said they met `` to discuss strategies for further developing and making available blowout containment capabilities moving forward , '' but did not elaborate beyond that . James W. Noe , senior vice president and general counsel of Hercules , a leading shallow-water drilling company , said he and his colleagues were concerned that without adequate industry input , government officials would create drilling rules that would pick `` winners and losers . That 's not a model that works . '' Noe added that despite Salazar 's decision Oct. 12 to end the moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf , federal officials were not approving permits fast enough . The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement has issued half a dozen permits for drilling new shallow-water wells in the past couple of weeks , bringing the total number of new well permits to 13 since the April 20 Macondo blowout , which is only one more than had been issued in April alone prior to accident . `` The industry 's not dead . But there 's only so much fiddling around you can do on existing wells , '' Noe said , adding , `` We 've seen several hundred layoffs , but not the massive layoffs we feared . '' Faced with complaints , Noe said BOEMRE Director Michael Bromwich had said there were only 10 new well permits pending . But Noe said that 's because of a backlog of exploration and development plans that have not been approved . The number of those awaiting action was 69 as of Aug. 17 , he said , and since then BOEMRE has stopped releasing figures . Each of those plans includes about three to five wells . At the same time , Interior is facing a legal challenge from the Center for Biological Diversity , which questions whether Salazar adequately evaluated the environmental risks involved in deepwater drilling when he lifted the moratorium last week . At the time of the announcement , Salazar declared that the new well permitting and workplace safety rules the government had adopted recently had `` significantly reduced those risks '' associated with deepwater energy exploration . The brief seeking an injunction of the policy challenges those assumptions , saying , `` the secretary has not cured serious underlying problems that contributed to the April 20 , 2010 blowout of the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , and massive oil spill , namely , excluding drilling plans from environmental review . Therefore , the Secretary is repeating the same errors in allowing risky drilling to proceed without analyzing the significant environmental effects .

The presidential commission investigating the mammoth oil spill said Thursday that the cement mixture repeatedly failed lab tests before the April 20 blowout . Halliburton later issued its own statement , dismissing some of those lab tests as preliminary or irrelevant but also adding - without explanation - that the cement mixture ultimately used on the well did not undergo the complete battery of safety tests . As early as February , Halliburton was getting poor results in lab tests of the recipe for the cement it was planning to use , according to evidence collected by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling . Three separate tests suggested that the mixture would be `` unstable , '' according to a commission staff letter released Thursday . Halliburton notified BP by e-mail about only one of the tests before the well explosion , according to the commission . The two companies went ahead with the cementing job anyway . Its failure became the first in a cascade of factors leading to the accident . The results of a fourth Halliburton test - the only one indicating that the cement slurry might have been able to contain the high-pressure pool of oil and gas at the bottom of the Macondo well - were not available until the night of April 19 at the earliest and perhaps not until after the cement was poured , the commission staff said . The oil spill commission is sifting through the events leading to the April 20 explosion , which killed 11 workers , sank the Deepwater Horizon and triggered a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The cement at the bottom of the exploratory well was supposed to have provided a seal until a production facility could be built . The reason for the cement job 's failure has been a matter of dispute for months . Halliburton has pointed at BP ; BP has challenged Halliburton . Halliburton late Thursday night issued a statement disputing the commission staff 's letter , calling the February tests `` preliminary '' and saying that `` final well conditions were not known at that time . '' Halliburton added that the first of the April tests was `` irrelevant '' because of errors at the lab , and it said that , contrary to the commission letter , BP was informed of that test . The news spooked shareholders ; Halliburton 's stock closed at $ 31.68 a share , down nearly 8 percent . BP said it had no comment . The commission letter reiterated that the cement was just one contributor to the disaster . `` Cementing wells is a complex endeavor , and industry experts inform us that cementing failures are not uncommon even in the best of circumstances , '' the commission letter says .

The document , obtained by the journalism group ProPublica , shows that as of Oct. 1 , at least 148 BP pipelines on Alaska 's North Slope received an `` F-rank '' from the company . According to BP oil workers , that means inspections have determined that more than 80 percent of the pipe wall is corroded and could rupture . Most of those lines carry toxic or flammable substances . Many of the metal walls of the F-ranked pipes are worn to within a few thousandths of an inch of bursting , according to the document , risking an explosion or spills . BP oil workers also say that the company 's fire and gas warning systems are unreliable , that the giant turbines that pump oil and gas through the system are aging and that some oil and waste holding tanks are verging on collapse . In an e-mail , BP Alaska spokesman Steve Rinehart said the company has `` an aggressive and comprehensive pipeline inspection and maintenance program , '' which includes pouring millions of dollars into the system and regularly testing for safety , reliability and corrosion . He said that although an F-rank is serious , it does not necessarily mean there is a current safety risk . Rinehart added that the company will immediately reduce the operating pressure in worrisome lines until it completes repairs . `` We will not operate equipment or facilities that we believe are unsafe , '' he said . Rinehart did not respond to questions about what portion of its extensive pipeline system was affected or whether 148 F-ranks were more or less than normal , except to say that the company has more than 1,600 miles of pipelines and does more than 100,000 inspections a year . In 2006 , two spills from corroded pipes in Alaska placed the company 's maintenance problems in the national spotlight . At the time , BP temporarily shut down all transmission of oil from the North Slope to the continental United States , cutting off about 8 percent of the nation 's oil supply , while it examined its pipeline system . Photos taken by employees in the Prudhoe Bay drilling field this summer , and viewed by ProPublica , show sagging and rusted pipelines , some dipping in gentle U-shapes into pools of water and others sinking deeply into thawing permafrost . Marc Kovac , a BP mechanic and welder , said that some of the pipes have hundreds of patches on them and that BP 's efforts to rehabilitate the lines were not funded well enough to keep up with their rate of decline . `` They 're going to run this out as far as they can without leaving one dollar on the table when they leave , '' Kovac said . BP Alaska 's operating budget is private , so the picture of its maintenance program is incomplete . But documents obtained by ProPublica show that BP has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into maintenance and equipment upgrades on the North Slope since the 2006 spills . In 2007 , BP 's maintenance budget in Alaska was nearly $ 195 million , four times what it was in 2004 , according to a company presentation . In 2009 , $ 49 million was budgeted to replace and upgrade systems that detect fires and gas leaks alone . Despite the investment , workers say that the capabilities of equipment of all types continue to be stretched and that maintenance plans set years ago remain incomplete . BP employees told ProPublica that several of the 120 turbines used to compress gas and push it through the pipelines have been modified to run at higher stress levels and higher temperatures than they were originally designed to handle . They also said giant tanks that hold hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic fluids and waste are sagging under the load of corrosive sediment and could collapse .

In this waterfront city , where many lost their livelihoods to the summer of oil , a mixture of relief and melancholy greeted the news Tuesday . A financially healthy BP means jobs and compensation , but residents still reeling from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history are waiting for some good news of their own . BP said that costs related to the April 20 oil spill dragged down its third-quarter profit by more than 60 percent . The London-based company earned $ 1.79 billion from July through September , compared with $ 5.3 billion a year earlier . But the fact that BP returned to profits at all , coming after a loss of $ 17.2 billion in the second quarter , indicated the company 's operations remain solid despite the spill . `` That 's real good news they 're making money because at least we know they have the ability to pay us over a long period of time because we 've still got a lot of problems , '' said shrimp processor Rudy Lesso , whose Biloxi , Miss. business is down about 25 percent because much of the public is still afraid to eat Gulf seafood . BP has set up a $ 20 billion compensation fund to pay victims of the oil spill , cutting roughly $ 1.7 billion in checks so far . But the process has been slow and cumbersome for struggling Gulf coast residents . BP 's third-quarter performance fell well short of the industry norm . All the other major oil companies , except Chevron , have reported stronger third quarter profits thanks to higher oil and gas prices . The company 's $ 40 billion estimate for its overall spill response was $ 7.7 billion higher than its previous estimate provided during its second-quarter results released this summer , largely due to unanticipated additional expenses . The company had already spent $ 11.2 billion responding to the spill by the end of September . None of that , however , kept BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley from delivering a rosy prognosis . `` What I can report today is that BP is now in recovery mode , '' Dudley said Tuesday from London . At one point he talked about how the situation looks without the spill - an unthinkable leap for Gulf residents . `` Putting aside the incident ... the BP group as a whole delivered a strong business performance throughout the quarter in terms of both financial and safety performance , '' he added . Ewell Smith , head of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board , said people forget that oil and fishing have for decades `` worked side by side '' in the Gulf region .

Bartlit Jr. , were doing work for Halliburton , a contractor for BP . At the time of the hearing , the law firm 's Web site also listed Halliburton under the heading `` Representative Clients . '' But the firm 's managing partner , Sidney N. Herman , later said that the firm has not done any work for Halliburton `` for at least five years . '' ` Culture of complacency ' at BP set stage for oil spill , commission chief says Tuesday , November 9 , 2010 ; 9:09 PM Monday was a relatively good day for BP in the glare of oil spill inquiries . Tuesday was a bad day . Drilling experts and corporate rivals testifying before a presidential oil spill commission blasted BP Tuesday for decisions about the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that might have removed obstacles to the April 20 blowout that led to the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill . BP 's final well designs were `` deficient in detail , '' said Steve Lewis , a drilling engineer with Seldovia Marine Services , who later added that the `` the operational detail in my mind was totally deficient '' and `` totally inadequate . '' Shell Oil 's chief well scientist Charlie Williams said his company typically uses three to five plugs when temporarily abandoning a well . And John Rogers Smith , associate professor of petroleum engineering at Louisiana State University , said the way BP replaced drilling mud with seawater was `` not prudent . '' The commission 's co-chairman William K. Reilly opened the day saying that a `` suite of bad decisions '' revealed `` a culture of complacency '' at BP as well as its main contractors Transocean and Halliburton . He concluded the day saying that the deepwater drilling disaster was the result of systemic problems , not isolated ones . The renewed criticism of BP came one day after Fred H. Bartlit Jr. , the general counsel of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , seemed to absolve BP of allegations that it let cost worries trump safety concerns . Bartlit said Monday that `` to date , we have not seen a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety . '' The commission members backpedaled from that assessment and even Bartlit sought to explain himself . Reilly said that the commission staff `` did not ascribe motive to any of those decisions . '' Bartlit said the commission was still investigating and could draw inferences about whether time - and money-saving measures had increased risks on the Deepwater Horizon , where 11 workers died in the April 20 explosion . But the question of motive - whether BP was rushing to finish a costly and tardy well - hung over the entire day . A representative of a plaintiffs ' attorney group noted that several lawyers at Bartlit 's firm are doing work for Halliburton . Lewis said he had seen copies of internal BP communications suggesting that the London-based oil giant was worried about finishing the Macondo oil well and moving the drilling rig to Kaskida , another Gulf of Mexico location , where a BP lease would expire by May 16 if certain work were n't done there . `` They had commitments to wells , regulatory commitments , that were required to maintain in the one case a viable lease that required well work , '' Lewis said . Commission staff attempted to rebut Lewis later . Bartlit said that `` we have more facts than Mr. Lewis '' and that `` it does not appear to us that there was a rush to get to another lease . '' Commission sources and those close to BP later added that by early April BP had weighed the option of dropping a plan for work that was originally to have been done after Macondo but before Kaskida . That intermediate job would have permanently plugged the Nile well , not far from Macondo , and would have taken about a month .

The interim report from the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council says that a variety of failures `` indicate the lack of a suitable approach for anticipating and managing the inherent risks , uncertainties , and dangers associated with deepwater drilling operations and a failure to learn from previous near misses . '' The report , set for Wednesday afternoon release but reported by the Wall Street Journal , draws largely on evidence that has already emerged in the course of other inquiries into the April 20 blowout at the Macondo well . The blowout killed 11 people aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , which caught fire and sank , triggering the enormous oil spill . The committee of academics appears to have been taken aback by the education and training levels of people on the rig . The chairman of the committee is Donald C. Winter , professor in the University of Michigan 's Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering . `` Personnel on the Deepwater Horizon were mostly trained on the job , and this training was supplemented with limited short courses , '' the report said . `` While this appears to be consistent with industry standard practice and current regulations cents it is not consistent with other safety-critical industries such as nuclear power or chemical manufacturing . '' Like the presidential oil spill commission , the National Academy of Engineering took aim at the cementing job on the Macondo well . It pointed out that there had been a loss of drilling mud in the hole , indicating probable fractures in the rock that would weaken any cementing job . It noted that the well design complicated the drilling operation , especially given that there were multiple hydrocarbon zones . It also criticized the failure to run one kind of cement test and the failure to pay any attention to bad results from another test of the cement . With regard to rig workers ' failure to determine why a critical pressure test failed , the report says their conduct `` suggests a lack of onboard expertise and of clearly defined responsibilities '' and `` a lack of management discipline that is inconsistent with the stakes involved . '' That pressure test should have detected faults in cement designed to seal the well . "}, {"uid": "4", "dct": "2010-11-17", "dates": [null, null], "text": "What BP should have done This morning a committee of the National Academy of Engineering released its interim report on the BP oil spill -LRB- here 's the pdf of the report -RRB- . It 's written in committee-speak and is a little chewy at key moments , such as when it addresses whether BP traded safety for dollars . There 's a general -LRB- and rather obvious -RRB- message to the oil industry and to government regulators that they need to upgrade their personnel , their training and take more seriously the hazards of drilling holes in the deep sea . Here 's a key passage that gives you a flavor of the report : The often-made assertion at the MBI hearing -LRB- a joint investigation of the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -RRB- that safety was never compromised suggests that the risks that are an inherent part of engineering processes in this and many other industries were not fully recognized . As it appears from the testimony that many of the pivotal choices made for the drilling operation and temporary abandonment of the well were likely to result in less cost and less time relative to other options , the committee will be examining the use of a separate path of reporting and oversight employed elsewhere to ensure that decisions made in the interest of cost and schedule do not unreasonably compromise safety . Lurking in that paragraph is a key insight . The line about no-tradeoff of safety and cost carries a footnote to the testimony of John Guide , the Macondo well team leader , who worked at BP 's Houston office . As the committee notes , the well team leader `` was responsible for cost and schedule in addition to decisions affecting the integrity and safety of the well . '' So he 's always got two things in mind : efficiency and safety . And they tug against each other , inevitably . Doing that extra cement test ? Waiting around for parts to be delivered ? How long do you wait for the cement to cure before going on to the next step ? Should you speed things up by doing simultaneous operations -LRB- say , offloading mud to a supply boat while doing a pressure test on the well -RRB- even if that complicates the monitoring of the well ? Go back to that paragraph , and the line about `` the risks that are an inherent part of engineering processes in this and many other industries were not fully recognized . '' Here 's one way to translate that into English : This is dangerous stuff ! The only truly , 100 percent safe thing to do is not drill at all ! But of course , there 's reality . We use a lot of oil in the USA . We 're addicted to it . It has to come from somewhere . If you want domestically produced oil you have to go where the oil is , such as the Gulf of Mexico . And there 's a lot of oil in the deep water . Here 's the fact , though : Even if you build the case that we need offshore drilling , and even if you believe we need offshore deep-water drilling , you could still argue that we did n't need the Macondo well . BP could have -- and arguably should have -- abandoned the Macondo well . Not temporarily abandoned , which is what it was doing on April 20 when the well blew out and the Deepwater Horizon turned into an inferno . BP was converting the exploratory well into a production well and was going to plug it with cement and let an oil platform produce the oil later on . But BP had the option -- and considered the option , according to witness testimony in October -LRB- I ca n't put my finger on it but I remember it , and it got some press -RRB- -- of saying , in effect , `` This well is a nightmare -- and we quit . '' The Gulf of Mexico is a hard place to drill in general -LRB- it is famously `` overpressured '' and gassy -RRB- , but this well had special challenges . A quick primer : Wells are drilled using heavy `` mud '' that serves multiple functions , from cooling the drilling bit to circulating out the chips of rock to , most importantly , helping control the well and keeping it from blowing out . But the mud has to be the right weight . If it 's too heavy , it can escape into the reservoirs down there in the rock . If it 's too light , it 'll get bullied by the hydrocarbons . There 's something called the pore pressure and something called the fracture gradient and what you ideally would like to see in a well is a big difference between the two . But this well had a narrow window in which to operate . The mud weight had to be very precisely adjusted . This morning I talked to Mark Zoback , one of the NAE committee members . Zoback , a professor of geophysics at Stanford , said , `` The cement job may have been doomed from the beginning . '' He pointed out that there were five reservoirs or `` sands '' down in the Macondo well , with differing qualities and pressures . The top sand was a brine sand , for example , and it had greater pore pressure than the sands with oil and gas farther down . The BP team tried to cement the whole suite of sands in a single job , with a single cement density , and that was a recipe for failure , Zoback said . `` It may have been ill advised to try to cement off all five of these sands in one operation because they had to thread the needle with respect to the pressures , '' he said . They could have tried other cement strategies , other well designs , other tests . They could have done a lot of things differently . And it might have worked . And Macondo might be sitting there neatly plugged with cement , waiting in the gulf for someone to drill it again and pull out all that oil . But I keep thinking of something that Shane Roshto , one of the 11 men killed in the blowout , said to his wife , Natalie , at home before returning to the Deepwater Horizon : `` Mother Nature does not want to be drilled there . '' Thanks for answering a bunch of the questions I had about about that oil well . This is the first I 'm hearing about the five different sands and the problem of cementing them . It 's also pretty fascinating to learn that the entire cementing operation might have been doomed from the git-go . I confess I have n't followed all the stories as closely as I might , but for me this is the first I 'm hearing of the '' `` This well is a nightmare -- and we quit '' theme . We 've known from the beginning BP was shutting the well down ... but with the understanding it was for later production by somebody else . There was no `` we quit ; it has beant us '' aspect to it -LRB- not that I saw , anyway -RRB- . It really shades the perspective quit a bit . And the Roshto quote indicates some of the people on the weel knew it . Ca n't wait for your book to come out . While I am sure the loss of revenue from their lease for that area will cost them something in the long run , perhaps it 's for the best that they just walk away . Turtle domes , diapirs -LRB- not to be confused with diapers -RRB- , and canopies . Interesting that the story in the Wall Street Journal came out 13 hours ago , and the NYT published yesterday -LRB- but no interview with Zoback in Palo Alto -RRB- ... Note , too , that this interim report -LRB- final report due in June -RRB- by the National Academy of Engineers also pointed a lot of blame at the federal Minerals Management Service . Funny that that 's not mentioned in Joel 's write-up . Once it was apparent that the BP leadership was going to change , he would have blocked all actions until the new team took over . Think of all the money they would have saved . Even fracking , mentioned in the article I linked to below in terms of drilling for natural gas , was a plot element in last week 's CSI episode -- also a concern in Texas , as the article points out . Who did I run into or what did I read about the huge increase in drilling activities , increase in propery values , scramble for housing , going on just to the southwest of us ? I think the team should be called `` Washington Pass-the-Bucks . '' There 's the obvious animal reference . The double entendre , given that Congress appropriates monies , plus the do-nothingness of the institution . Comprehensive energy policy or immigration reform , anyone ? Did anyone catch his interview this week on Morning Joe . Of course , they changed the subject on him to the political situation , rather than letting him talk about the two disasters that occurred in his state under the management of two different administrations . He had a lot to say about federal ineptness , and Jindal 's comments about the more recent one definitely caught my attention . Hard to get excited about a book from speculative press members who write that the Gulf spill may be carried by currents up the Atlantic seaboard . Or the irrational public that did not book rooms in the Sunshine State , prompting frivolous lawsuits against BP . Do you think the speculation led to the irrational behavior ? I 'm having enough problems with speculative reporting by the Patriot Ledger in Quincy regarding those old bones turned up in 1999 in Scituate -- not to mention the corresponding reports compiled by the state government ! And tell me why it is that Salazar has lifted the ban on offshore drilling but BOEMRE refuses to issue any permits ? That 's strange , is n't it ? And have any of us changed our oil consumption behavior ? Sometimes you are dealing with situations which get out of hand very quickly . Little projects you do n't think are a big deal erupt into things where people are running around looking for the shot-off valves . My last plumbing project was several years ago . I replaced both of the shower valves in our house one summer while our son was at scout camp . That way we only needed one bathroom usable at a time . At each phase , I shut off and drained the house but I had to have a restart plan to get service back even if the project was n't quite done . ` You can never have too many valves ' is a good motto . That is as long as leaky valves are n't your problem . I do n't quite get though why the well should have been shut down permanently earlier . The over-budget part does indicate it was n't their best work , but was it that bad earlier ? Cassandra , I 'm with you on the Mother Nature quote . laloomis , I thought the complaint about the Hill was that they were doing too much . Now they 're Do-Nothings ?

In other words , it is doomed . But it does have the virtue of being true . Sometimes the secret in any complex endeavor is to recognize and respect the limits of one 's knowledge . This has been called the courage of uncertainty . Alas , as we all know , in many , many cases the last thing powerful people want to hear is the phrase `` I do n't know . '' When this happens the temptation to find somebody else who can exploit the ambiguity to support the position they find pleasing can be overwhelming . And from this comes much mischief . One afternoon in June 2009 , Gov. Sarah Palin was sitting in the Washington office of her friend Fred Malek , whom she met through McCain during the 2008 campaign . She was listening to the former White House aide to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford map out logical next steps to her political career . Focus on amassing a good record as governor , he advised her . Run for a second term . Develop some policy expertise . Do some extensive overseas travel . Generate some good will by campaigning for fellow Republicans . Malek told me that he could tell that this was n't what Palin wanted to hear . Here 's the problem , she replied impatiently : I 've got a long commute from my house to my office . I do n't have the funds to pay for my family to travel with me , and the state wo n't pay for it , either . I ca n't afford to have security at my home -- anybody can come up to my door , and they do . Under the laws of Alaska , anybody can file suit or an ethics charge against me , and I have to defend it on my own . I 'm going into debt . Numerous decisions to proceed toward abandonment despite indications of hazard , such as the results of repeated negative-pressure tests , suggest an insufficient consideration of risk and a lack of operating discipline . The decisions also raise questions about the adequacy of operating knowledge on the part of key personnel . That is about the most severe beat-down I have ever read in a formal report . I do n't see how that could have been accidental ; she must have made a checklist or something . I wonder if Malek ever told her not to worry too much about shopping for a new dress . Or to make nice with Lisa Murkowski . It 's rare to see `` they were careless and ignorant '' in such a document . In Our Fair City taking care of business in the waning days of my mayoralty . Two terms of working on being more empathetic is paying off . I can kind of , sort of , see some merit in Palin 's resignation . Of course that could just be confidence that her successor could n't possibly be anything but better . Did notice the annihalation detector in the diagram though , that amuses me so some reason . Looking back , in sense he was melding Hoyle 's `` steady state '' theory with the opposite of the Big Bang , the `` Big Crunch '' . Do n't know that I could have made a good petroleum drilling expert . I wonder how much of Brazil 's huge , alluring , and difficult oil fields will prove undrillable , or at least not-prudently-drillable . Bj n Lomborg 's column is n't all bad , but his best guess about sea level rise seems to be far lower than what the experts are suggesting , which is on the order of planning for as much as 5 feet rise over the next 90 years . His comments about Tokyo 's defenses against subsidence are appropriate , but perhaps more in the context of preserving New Orleans under present-day conditions than about the future . Tokyo 's flood defenses make the `` improved '' defenses of New Orleans look unfit for areas inhabited by human beings . The Netherlands has an excellent national plan for adapting to rising sea level . While much of the Netherlands ' water management has roots in traditional practices , the national plan is a matter of extremely sophisticated engineering and environmental planning . Doing something similar for Chesapeake Bay would be an immense undertaking . The Everglades are unsalvageable , except to the extent that restoring natural water flow can According to geologist Harold Wanless of the University of Miami , the southern Florida metro area -LRB- specifically Miami and Ft Lauderdale -RRB- ca n't be protected by levees because the underlying rock is too porous . Wanless thinks we need to be planning for radical shrinkage of the urban area and its eventual demise -LRB- aided by decreased rainfall and nastier hurricanes as the land area shrinks -RRB- . Despite the thicket of inane comments on Lomborg 's column -LRB- and David Brooks -RRB- , modeling works . It 's easy to lie with models , fool yourself with models , lead others astray , whatever . But making mathematical models is essential to economics , population biology , running electricity grids , planning highways , drilling for oil , and any number of other things essential to making modern society work . Much modeling requires only high school algebra and access to Microsoft Excel , which gives the functionality of matrix algebra . He will be missed . in the cementing operation .

But the cementing job is to inject some cement between the casing , a sturdy steel tube , and the local geology . The cement job fills the gap between the outer casing and the drilled surface . As the hole is drilled down this small interspace might , or might not , be filled with cementing matter . It 's rarely cemented all the way down . The cementing technique and the cement itself will vary depending on the local geology -LRB- or sands , as the oil people say -RRB- , as the outer steel casing does n't vary . The Macondo goes through alternating layers of salt and shale for about 2 miles deep ; surely the cementing job will face different challenges depending on where it 's at . Pressure of the product and type of geology\\/sand must be important in choosing the cementing technique for the segment at hand . It seemed worth finding the original , so here it is .

Beat him at what ? Her voice alone defeats me . I take great satisfaction in the fact that she 's the Repugs ' worst nightmare ... reflected well here by Ann Telnaes ' animated cartoon -- Did anyone espy the meteor showers last night ? I thought about setting my alarm for 3:00 am to take a look-see but did n't since I 've not slept a whole night through in the last few months . Would n't you know ? For the first time I slept over eight hours straight ! \\* grinning at major breakthrough \\* Holding several of you close in my heart today ... slyness , Cassandra 's daughter , TBG and sister . In her wildest dreams she does n't see that ! She probably thinks that if she wins , the ability would be implied . Patti Smith won the National Book Award for nonfiction . Franzen not only did n't win the fiction award , he did n't even make the final cut . Andy Borowitz hosted the event for the second year in a row : I said last year that publishing was a sinking ship , Mr. Borowitz said . I believe that publishing is still very much in the process of sinking . Publishing is a Carnival cruise ship . It s on fire , the toilets don t work , but we are surviving day to day on Pop-Tarts and Spam . I still do n't believe Palin wants to be president ; I think she 's learned her lesson that governing means actually doing the work . But she has also learned another lesson all too well : that she can make millions by keeoing her `` brand '' and her face out front , AND , even more important , the incredible strokes to her ego by being the Queen Bee , the kingmaker , the powerbroker , the `` face '' of the Tea Party , that entire package . So yeah , sure , she can freely and joyously say she can beat Obama . It 's no longer a political statement -LRB- or even a delusion -RRB- ; rather , it is simply a necessary part of her schtick , her pitch , her sales presentation . This is n't Palin 's politics ; this is Palin 's marketing . She 's not channeling Lee Atwater ; she 's channeling Billie Mays . And not only that , she has about another year and a half of this befofre she has to finally get serious , figure out her best exit strategy -LRB- `` for the good of the party , I reluctantly withdraw ... blah blah -RRB- and become kingmaker when she endorses somebody else . That 's a year and a half of marketing , of selling , of speaking fees and book sales and appearances . Ai n't no freaking way she 's gonna give any of that up , or sit down and shut up . It 's money , people , money . She 's a publicity crack addict who gets well paid for her addiction . Always good to see bear news , even if the news is not particularly good . We are late getting ice here as well , though it is mostly humans who suffer when lakes are late in freezing . It delays the start of ice fishing and the attendant commerce . John McCain is at an age where you 'd think he 'd at least be considering how he wants to be remembered , if indeed he is remembered much at all . How do you explain that ? Palin 's voice is like fingernails on a black board . As usual RD , you cut to the heart of the matter - winning vs. governing - perfect ! SciTim , may your friend find new stars for the angels to play with . Hope everyone remains sniffle-free . Around here we seem to have a norovirus outbreak , especially in the schools . One week until ` Merikan Thanksgiving . Where has the time gone ? All the errors accrued by not cementing each zone separately could have been remedied . One difficulty for the layman and me has been a lack of access to the records of other wells nearby . Obviously those records are trade secrets and I understand that . I think a clearer picture would emerge of the engineering issues and how `` standard practices '' working in that geological area had emerged . As I understand it , those sands and the intervening strata are geologically younger than other fields . The sand grains are only loosely cemented in the sandstones . This fact does not make the drilling uncontrollable . It means , just as has been said , that each zone needs special attention , individual focus , when encountered . Methods to do that have long been known and widely used . Even if the well had cost twice as much , the profit would have still been substantial . That 's a fact . Tell us what is with , etc. .

Something has to be done about that ; I just have n't figured out what . I really do n't get the whole thing , but then I 'm not a Telnaes fan .

Had a hard time sleeping as the odor crept upstairs to the top floor . Off to take my sister to chemo today . She lives an hour south of here and has her infusions in Richmond , so there 's some good time spent together , like sisters like to have , not just in the infusion room , but the car , too . Time flies by when you 're with the ones you love . Keeping a good thought . Yoki-hope it 's not too late to fax mucho macho .

Off to Tampa for a long Thanksgiving break so later gators . Hug a gator for me . Road trips are kinda fun no matter what the circumstances .

I 've got to download some books from Audible for the car-ride to Atlanta and back next week . I 'm leaning towards the new Bill Bryson book . I only wish people who think Beck is for real would watch the clip and have their eyes opened - yeah , I know , wishful thinking . Time for a small rant : I have caller ID and never answer the phone if I do n't know who is calling . Over the last two or three weeks the March of Dimes has called here at least three times a day , every day . It always rings three times before stopping so it never goes to voicemail . The last call was five minutes ago . I have never had so many calls from a solicitor , not even the politicians can beat this for persistence and annoyance . Do charities not get the message that repeatedly calling me is going to make me less likely to contribute to them ? I am tempted now to pick up next time they call and give them a contribution that they will not like ! We have n't given anything to them for years and years yet we still get a call about once a month , usually early on a Saturday morning , asking if we will have anything for them that week .

The interim report from the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council says that a variety of failures `` indicate the lack of a suitable approach for anticipating and managing the inherent risks , uncertainties , and dangers associated with deep-water drilling operations and a failure to learn from previous near misses . '' The report , released Wednesday , draws largely on evidence that has already emerged in the course of other inquiries into the April 20 blowout at the Macondo well . The blowout killed 11 people aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , which caught fire and sank , triggering the enormous oil spill . The committee of academics appears to have been taken aback by the education and training levels of people on the rig . The chairman of the committee is Donald C. Winter , professor in the University of Michigan 's Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering . `` Personnel on the Deepwater Horizon were mostly trained on the job , and this training was supplemented with limited short courses , '' the report said . `` While this appears to be consistent with industry standard practice and current regulations ... it is not consistent with other safety-critical industries such as nuclear power or chemical manufacturing . '' Like the presidential oil spill commission , the National Academy of Engineering took aim at the cementing job on the Macondo well . It pointed out that there had been a loss of drilling mud in the hole , indicating probable fractures in the rock that would weaken any cementing job . It noted that the well design complicated the drilling operation , especially given that there were multiple hydrocarbon zones . It also criticized the failure to run one kind of cement test and the failure to pay any attention to bad results from another test of the cement . `` The cement job may have been doomed from the beginning , '' Mark Zoback , a professor of geophysics at Stanford and member of the National Academy of Engineering committee , said in an interview . He pointed out that there were five reservoirs or `` sands '' down in the Macondo well , with differing qualities and pressures . The top sand was a brine sand , for example , and it had greater pore pressure than the sands with oil and gas farther down . The BP team tried to cement the whole suite of sands in a single job , with a single cement density , and that was a recipe for failure , Zoback said . `` It may have been ill-advised to try to cement off all five of these sands in one operation because they had to thread the needle with respect to the pressures , '' he said . With regard to rig workers ' failure to determine why a critical pressure test failed , the report says their conduct `` suggests a lack of onboard expertise and of clearly defined responsibilities '' and `` a lack of management discipline that is inconsistent with the stakes involved . '' That pressure test should have detected faults in cement designed to seal the well . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that this `` science-based analysis of what went wrong in the lead-up to the blowout will help guide our continuing efforts to raise the bar for safety and oversight of offshore oil and gas operations , and will be of assistance to other ongoing investigations .

One of the reports written for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling said that federal agencies consistently spent less than they were authorized to spend on improving cleanup technology . In addition , two of the five biggest oil companies - Conoco Phillips and Chevron - spent no money at all in the past 20 years on developing better in-house ways to clean up after a spill . Two companies spent only modest amounts , and BP 's response was unclear on whether it spent money on cleanup technology . Exxon Mobil , which suffered a spill by the Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska in 1989 , told the commission that its investments in oil spill containment and cleanup technology amounted to about $ 60 million over the past 20 years . Citing phrases used in an industry report , the draft reports said that `` neither boom design and construction , nor the ` principles behind skimming systems , ' nor the ` basics of mechanical recovery systems , ' have significantly changed . '' It added , `` Existing response equipment was not up to the challenge of such a large spill . '' In a second report , the commission staff said that although BP was able to come up with spill control techniques `` in a compressed time frame , '' it added that `` those impressive efforts ... were made necessary by the failure to anticipate a subsea blowout in the first place . '' The commission staff urged the commission members to adopt a series of recommendations including that the government hire its own petroleum engineering experts ; improve techniques for getting a quick , accurate estimate of the flow of oil in a spill ; order better diagnostic tools be installed on blowout preventers ; and ensure that smaller companies drilling offshore exploratory wells have insurance or partners with the financial capability of responding to any disaster in the future .

Feinberg is in charge of handing out $ 20 billion of BP 's money , but he 's finding that it is n't easy . But not everyone is buying into his plan . Last Friday , a senior Justice Department official sent a letter to Feinberg warning of `` concerns '' over the pace of the claims process , the `` overbroad '' release forms for settlements , and the need for `` additional transparency . '' The letter said `` the success of the GCCF must be judged by whether the people of the Gulf feel fairly treated . '' Earlier this month , Alabama Gov. Bob Riley -LRB- R -RRB- called Feinberg 's claims process `` extortion , '' and outgoing Alabama Attorney General Troy King issued a `` consumer alert '' warning people that Feinberg `` works for BP . '' Feinberg was named by President Obama , though BP is paying him and four other lawyers at his firm $ 850,000 a month to run the fund . Plaintiffs attorneys are also wary . `` It seems silly at this point , when we do n't know what the long-term environmental effects are going to be , '' said one lawyer who said he did n't want to comment publicly until he has seen details of Feinberg 's offers . `` Why are they essentially ... coming just before Christmas and flashing some money in front of people 's eyes and trying to get them to waive their rights ? That 's not the optimal situation . '' As of Nov. 18 , the BP claims fund made $ 1.88 billion of emergency payments to 86,728 individuals and 31,271 businesses . Feinberg and his team have rejected 56,197 claims . Feinberg received a total of 400,516 of damage claims , but only 8,055 of them were for final settlements . As a result , Feinberg has agreed to make `` interim '' payments , which will be reviewed every three months instead of every six months . Now gulf coast residents and businesses face this dilemma : If they want to hang on to their rights to sue BP and other companies , they can keep getting payments from Feinberg 's fund that will be reviewed , and possibly terminated . If they are ready to take lump sums for all present and future damages , they have to sign away their right to sue the London-based oil giant later . `` If I were a private lawyer , I would recommend that my clients take the money now , '' Feinberg said recently . He said `` finality is a virtue . '' Moreover , with fisheries and coastlines reopening for business , in a year or two damages might appear smaller than they do today . If the emergency payment program is any indication , coming up with final settlements wo n't be easy . Feinberg has made a career out of running big funds , such as the one for victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . He has relied on legal techniques to calculate payments designed to shortcut lengthy litigation . The Exxon Valdez case is the poster child of what can happen otherwise : it dragged on for 20 years , a big settlement was slashed on appeal , final payments were modest and many plaintiffs died before receiving anything . Although $ 20 billion might seem like enough to go around , Feinberg wants proof of damages , and that proof is n't clear-cut . A chiropractor says business is slow because there are n't as many people fishing . The Plaquemines Parish government is providing forms on which people write their names and a dollar figure with no backup documents ; they declare that they deserve money `` due to the hardship caused by the oil spill . '' Claims have also come from beer distributors and dentists . Florida restaurant and lodging businesses say they suffered because tourists were frightened off by predictions - incorrect as it turned out - that oil would reach their shores . Feinberg has been battling plaintiffs ' lawyers over the question of `` proximity , '' meaning how close to soiled coastlines is close enough for payments . Feinberg and his team - he has 3,000 people reviewing claims - have also unearthed 1,200 cases of alleged fraud . For a fee , a ring of more than a dozen boat owners and a tax preparer allegedly drew up and distributed fake documents to people who falsely claimed to be deckhands . One woman allegedly stole the identity of her dead sister so she could file a claim . Several individuals fabricated documents showing they owned gift shops that did n't exist . A person who was already in prison during the oil spill filed a claim for lost earnings . Lawyer Mike Papantino , in a September interview , said that the escrow fund should have been bigger . But when asked whether he 'd rather take $ 20 billion now versus litigating for a decade for $ 60 billion , he said he would rather take the money now . `` I want things to recover here . I 'd love to see it work for $ 20 billion , '' he said .

After the sale , BP will be most of the way toward its goal of selling as much as $ 30 billion in assets by the end of 2011 to help cover spill costs and bolster cash holdings to assure investors and lenders of the oil giant 's financial stability . The sales are expected to reduce BP 's assets by 10 to 15 percent . The price of the Argentina operations fell $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion short of what many analysts expected . Nonetheless , the latest sale of what is considered a non-core asset for BP demonstrates the huge scale of the London-based oil firm 's operations . In addition to asset sales , BP is raising more than $ 2.5 billion a quarter for spill costs from the suspension of its dividend . BP announced Sunday that it would sell its 60 percent interest in Pan American Energy 's oil and gas operations in Argentina to Bridas Corp. , which already owns the other 40 percent . BP acquired the interest when it bought Amoco in 1999 . Since then , BP has revived output from the aging Argentine fields , which now produce about 100,000 barrels of oil a day and 450 million cubic feet of natural gas per day . The vast bulk of that production comes from one field , Cerro Dragon , about 900 miles south of Buenos Aires . But Argentina 's tax policies have diminished the attractiveness of operating there , analysts said . Bridas was founded by the Bulgheroni family of Argentina . In May , the China National Offshore Oil Corp. , which has been expanding its worldwide operations , bought 50 percent of Bridas for $ 3.1 billion . CNOOC 's deep pockets helped make the BP sale possible ; it will provide much of the cash for the transaction . The price CNOOC paid earlier this year for its share of Bridas led many analysts to believe that BP would get more for its interests . The CNOOC purchase of Bridas implied a value of $ 15.5 billion for the entire Pan American Energy operation . That would have translated into a price of $ 9.3 billion for BP 's share . The sale does not include Pan American 's operations in Bolivia . `` Today 's agreement further demonstrates both the high quality and attractiveness of the assets throughout BP 's global portfolio and also the company 's ability to meet our significant financial commitments arising from the Gulf of Mexico tragedy , '' BP chief executive Bob Dudley said in a statement . At the end of the third quarter , BP had incurred costs of $ 11.6 billion as a result of the oil spill , not counting the $ 3 billion first installment it had paid into a $ 20 billion escrow fund . Even after those payments , the company had nearly $ 13 billion in cash and $ 17 billion of bank facilities it could draw down . The company expects the total cost of the oil spill to ultimately reach $ 40 billion . Dudley said BP would seek to sell other assets that might be `` strategically more valuable to others than to BP . '' Under the terms of the agreement , Bridas will pay BP a cash deposit of $ 3.53 billion , with the balance of the proceeds due on completion of the sale , which is expected to be completed by Dec. 28 . In China , CNOOC announced that it would join with Bridas 's Argentine shareholders to provide $ 4.94 billion , or 70 percent , of the purchase price . The remaining 30 percent will be covered by loans , or additional cash contributions if necessary . As of Dec. 31 , 2009 , BP 's 60 percent interest in Pan American accounted for 917 million barrels of oil equivalent reserves , about 5 percent of the company 's overall reserves . Production from Pan American accounted for 3.6 percent of BP 's global output .

The lawsuit accuses BP and other firms of violating federal regulations and failing to prevent the April 20 explosion and fire , which destroyed the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig . It seeks civil penalties under the Clean Water Act and a second federal statute for cleanup costs and widespread damage to the environment . Although the Justice Department did not spell out an amount , legal experts said the case could expose the companies to tens of billions of dollars in fines , under civil environmental laws . Justice officials emphasized that the filing - on the day of a deadline for civil filings - is a first step and that aggressive civil and criminal probes into the disaster are continuing . `` Even though the spill has been contained , even though it is no longer the focus of round-the-clock news coverage and the subject of front-page headlines , '' said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. at a news conference Wednesday , `` the department 's focus on investigating this disaster , and preventing future devastation , has not wavered . '' Scott Dean , a spokesman for London-based BP , said the government 's filing in federal court in New Orleans was expected and `` does not in any manner constitute any finding of liability or any judicial finding that the allegations have merit . '' He said the company - whose stock price dropped sharply during Holder 's announcement , then partially recovered by day 's end - is cooperating with all government inquiries . Other companies involved in the spill and named in the lawsuit affixed much of the blame on BP . Brian Kennedy , a spokesman for Transocean , which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig to BP , said : `` Responsibility for oil and natural gas discharged from a well lies solely with the well 's owner and operator ... Transocean is indemnified in this matter . '' John Christiansen , a spokesman for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , a minority owner of the well , said the company was `` not involved in the operations or decisions that occurred on the drilling rig . '' MOEX Offshore , another minority owner , said in a statement that it had `` no authority or responsibility to direct activities on the Deepwater Horizon . '' The Justice Department civil probe is on a parallel track with a criminal investigation that Holder said is `` very serious . '' Law enforcement officials and other sources have said the criminal investigation is focusing on BP , Transocean and engineering giant Halliburton , which was in charge of cementing the well . Sources said the FBI and other investigators are examining whether , in addition to violating environmental laws , company officials made false statements to regulators , obstructed justice or falsified test results for devices such as the rig 's failed blowout preventer . Another line of inquiry , sources said , is whether the companies ' cozy relationship with federal regulators contributed to the disaster . Halliburton , which has declined to comment on the investigation , was not named in the civil lawsuit . The suit is expected to become part of broad civil litigation pending in U.S. District Court in New Orleans . Nearly 400 lawsuits against BP and other companies - filed on behalf of fishermen , environmental groups and others in the Gulf of Mexico region - have been consolidated before the same judge . Justice Department officials said their participation will give them access to documents and other materials handed over in pretrial discovery , which will aid the government 's broader civil and criminal probes . Officials said the timing of their filing was related to Wednesday 's deadline set by the judge . The 27-page document says the companies failed to use the safest drilling technology and to maintain equipment `` necessary to ensure the safety and protection of personnel , equipment , natural resources , and the environment . '' It offers little evidence for those assertions , but officials said additional grounds - and defendants - could be named later . Roger Marzulla , an environmental lawyer who headed the Justice Department 's environment division in the Reagan administration , said it appeared that `` the government got rushed by the court 's deadline . They filed as generic a complaint as possible and figured ` we 'll sort it all out later . ' '' Experts said the legal standard to prove liability under the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act - the other law under which the government sued - is low . `` You just have to show that an event occurred and that a particular entity or person is responsible , '' said William Carter , a former federal environmental prosecutor . `` Anything short of an act of God - a lightning bolt hitting something - and that person is going to be responsible for the cleanup . '' Under the Clean Water Act , if the government can prove that BP or other companies engaged in `` gross negligence , '' each firm could be fined up to $ 4,300 per barrel of oil spilled . Nearly 5 million barrels were spilled into the gulf , according to federal estimates . `` Tens of billions of dollars is certainly a legitimate prospect here , '' Marzulla said .

Brian Kennedy , a spokesman for Transocean , which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig to BP , said : `` Responsibility for oil and natural gas discharged from a well lies solely with the well 's owner and operator ... Transocean is indemnified in this matter . '' John Christiansen , a spokesman for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , a minority owner of the well , said the company was `` not involved in the operations or decisions that occurred on the drilling rig . '' MOEX Offshore , another minority owner , said in a statement that it had `` no authority or responsibility to direct activities on the Deepwater Horizon . '' The Justice Department civil probe is on a parallel track with a criminal investigation that Holder said is `` very serious . '' Law enforcement officials and other sources have said the criminal investigation is focusing on BP , Transocean and engineering giant Halliburton , which was in charge of cementing the well . Sources said the FBI and other investigators are examining whether , in addition to violating environmental laws , company officials made false statements to regulators , obstructed justice or falsified test results for devices such as the rig 's failed blowout preventer . Another line of inquiry , sources said , is whether the companies ' cozy relationship with federal regulators contributed to the disaster . Halliburton , which has declined to comment on the investigation , was not named in the civil lawsuit . The suit is expected to become part of broad civil litigation pending in U.S. District Court in New Orleans . Nearly 400 lawsuits against BP and other companies - filed on behalf of fishermen , environmental groups and others in the Gulf of Mexico region - have been consolidated before the same judge . Justice Department officials said their participation will give them access to documents and other materials handed over in pretrial discovery , which will aid the government 's broader civil and criminal probes . Officials said the timing of their filing was related to Wednesday 's deadline set by the judge . The 27-page document says the companies failed to use the safest drilling technology and to maintain equipment `` necessary to ensure the safety and protection of personnel , equipment , natural resources , and the environment . '' It offers little evidence for those assertions , but officials said additional grounds - and defendants - could be named later . Roger Marzulla , an environmental lawyer who headed the Justice Department 's environment division in the Reagan administration , said it appeared that `` the government got rushed by the court 's deadline . They filed as generic a complaint as possible and figured ` we 'll sort it all out later . ' '' Experts said the legal standard to prove liability under the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act - the other law under which the government sued - is low . `` You just have to show that an event occurred and that a particular entity or person is responsible , '' said William Carter , a former federal environmental prosecutor . `` Anything short of an act of God - a lightning bolt hitting something - and that person is going to be responsible for the cleanup . '' Under the Clean Water Act , if the government can prove that BP or other companies engaged in `` gross negligence , '' each firm could be fined up to $ 4,300 per barrel of oil spilled . Nearly 5 million barrels were spilled into the gulf , according to federal estimates . `` Tens of billions of dollars is certainly a legitimate prospect here , '' Marzulla said .

The commission said that the April 20 blowout at BP 's Macondo well was not inevitable , but rather a failure of management in which officials from all three firms ignored critical warning signs and failed to take precautions that might have delayed the completion of the well but also might have averted the environmental disaster . In a chapter released from the final report due out next week , the commission said : `` The blowout was not the product of a series of aberrational decisions made by rogue industry or government officials that could not have been anticipated or expected to occur again . Rather , the root causes are systemic and , absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies , might well recur . '' The document provided a detailed account of the missteps that led to the spill , but most of the details have been revealed in other reports or investigations so far . It recounts fateful decisions by all three major corporate actors , including the failure to use enough centralizers to keep the pipe in the middle of the well , choices about the type of steel pipe used , and failure to heed or share test results suggesting that the cement used to seal the well could fail . In the case of the failure to use enough centralizers , the report said that `` the evidence to date does not unequivocally establish whether '' that was a `` direct cause '' of the blowout , but the commission said that it `` illuminates the flaws in BP 's management and design procedures , as well as poor communication between BP and Halliburton . '' The commission report also cited a Dec. 23 , 2009 , North Sea incident on one of Transocean 's rigs , which the commission said was an `` eerily similar near-miss '' to what happened at the Macondo well . Though Transocean told the commission the incident was irrelevant , the commission said , `` The basic facts of both incidents are the same . Had the rig crew been adequately informed of the prior event and trained on its lessons , events at Macondo may have unfolded very differently . '' William K. Reilly , co-chairman of the commission appointed by President Obama , said that the commission had concluded that the blowout reflected `` a more pervasive problem '' within the oil industry . `` Given the documented failings of both Transocean and Halliburton , both of which serve the offshore industry in virtually every ocean , I reluctantly conclude we have a system-wide problem , '' Reilly said . Former senator and commission co-chair Bob Graham stressed the failure of regulators . He said , `` The Macondo blowout was the product of several individual missteps and oversights by BP , Halliburton and Transocean , which government regulators lacked the authority , the necessary resources and the technical expertise to prevent . '' The Interior Department issued a statement saying that it has `` already identified , acknowledged , and spent months working aggressively to reform '' offshore drilling . It said it would `` continue to make the changes necessary to restore the American people 's confidence in the safety and environmental soundness of oil and gas drilling and production on the Outer Continental Shelf . '' Last May , President Obama appointed Reilly and Graham to oversee the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling and gave them a January 2011 deadline to submit a report . Unlike Congress , the Justice Department or other probes , the oil spill commission lacked subpoena power but still sought to uncover the reasons for the disaster . It also criticized federal regulators and some Obama administration members for their response to the spill . But the most detailed descriptions in the chapter released Wednesday were of communications and decisions by BP , Transocean and Halliburton . `` The immediate cause of the Macondo blowout was a failure to contain hydrocarbon pressures in the well , '' the report said . `` Three things could have contained those pressures : the cement at the bottom of the well , the mud in the well and in the riser , and the blowout preventer . But mistakes and failures to appreciate risk compromised each of those potential barriers , steadily depriving the rig crew of safeguards until the blowout was inevitable and , at the very end , uncontrollable . '' The report highlighted a series of decisions that led to time-saving and cost-saving measures when alternatives were available . Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- said the report showed `` that the underlying profits-over-safety pathology may be in temporary remission , but not fully cured . '' The report said , `` Most of the mistakes and oversights at Macondo can be traced back to a single overarching failure - a failure of management . '' BP said it supports the commission 's efforts and `` is working with regulators and the industry to ensure that the lessons learned from Macondo lead to improvements in operations and contractor services in deepwater drilling . '' It said that it has already `` instituted significant changes designed to further strengthen safety and risk management . '' Transocean , meanwhile , sought to place blame with BP and regulators . `` Consistent with industry standards , the procedures being conducted in the final hours were crafted and directed by BP engineers and approved in advance by federal regulators , '' the company said in a statement . `` Based on the limited information made available to them , the Transocean crew took appropriate actions to gain control of the well . They were well trained and considered to be among the best in the business . '' Halliburton issued a statement sharply criticizing the presidential commission and BP . It blamed BP for failing to run a cement bond log test , which it called `` the only means to test the integrity of the cement bond . '' It said `` had BP properly interpreted the negative tests , the tests would have revealed any problems with the cement job . '' The company also reiterated disputes about the commission 's description of February and April lab tests of cement mixtures as failures , and asserted that Halliburton 's engineer on the Deepwater Horizon rig had received notice of satisfactory test results . Halliburton also accused the commission of having `` selectively omitted information we provided to them .

We 've turned our minds and diaries to 2011 , but nature does n't abide by the Gregorian calendar . What 's going on with the nearly 5 million barrels , or 207 million gallons , of oil that leaked ? Will the gulf ever be oil-free again ? No , but the vast majority of the oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill is already gone , according to a final government report released last month . That report , along with several experts contacted by the Lantern , provides a detailed picture of the oil spill and its aftermath . Trying to remove all oil from the gulf would be a Sisyphean task . Every year , oil tankers , drilling platforms and boats spill more than 310,000 gallons of oil into the gulf . But even if we halted human activity in the gulf , natural seeps from the sea floor would still send 42 million gallons of oil into gulf waters each year . These seeps actually prevented the BP spill from being an even worse disaster . The gulf has more natural seeps than any other body of water in or around North America . Because of this constant supply of hydrocarbons , there is always a healthy population of bacteria floating around the gulf looking for more food . When BP 's well blew out , these tiny creatures went into a feeding frenzy . -LRB- The lack of natural seeps , and oil-eating bacteria , is one of the reasons that Alaska 's Prince William Sound has been slow to bounce back from the Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989 . -RRB- Bacteria are far more reproductively agile -LRB- so to speak -RRB- than mammals , which take years to adjust their population size to changes in food supply . Within 24 hours of the spill , the number of oil-eating bacteria around the wellhead had grown tenfold . Under the right conditions , bacteria can degrade spilled oil remarkably quickly . Fortunately , conditions in the Gulf of Mexico are quite friendly to oil-gobbling bacteria , and the overwhelming majority of the BP oil was recaptured , burned off , evaporated , flushed out by ocean currents or eaten by bacteria by the end of July , just two weeks after BP managed to seal off the well . Because the bacteria and cleanup crews worked so quickly and the spill is now so diluted , it 's impossible to say exactly what percentage of the original oil is still around , but it 's a small fraction . When will every drop of the spilled oil be gone ? It 's hard to say . A gallon of oil contains a wide variety of compounds . Even hydrocarbons , the basic building blocks of oil , come in thousands of varieties . Different types of bacteria feed on different kinds of hydrocarbons , and some work faster than others . In addition , a single bacterial cell does n't take in a drop of hydrocarbon , fully digest it and excrete carbon dioxide and water . It 's more of a team effort , with several intermediate compounds being passed between hungry microbes . Bioremediation experts talk about half-life , by which they mean the time it takes for the bacteria to break down half of the oil . If you can keep cutting the amounts in half , you 'll never get to zero , but you 'll quickly get to inconsequential concentrations . Those last few molecules of hydrocarbons - the chemical compounds in oil that cause most of its health risks - are n't particularly important when they 're diluted in the gulf 's 643 quadrillion gallons of water . Researchers have used a bunch of fascinating strategies to measure biodegradation rates , both in the open water and in the laboratory . For example , they have set so-called bug traps - saturated beads of oil that attract bacteria - in the gulf . They watch which bacteria make their way to the oil and how long it takes them to break it down . By most estimations , the right colony of bacteria can break down oil so quickly that within six days the hydrocarbons are undetectable using the best available instruments . Between July and August , researchers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory took 170 samples of gulf water , starting at the wellhead and following the oil 's likely path away from it . They could n't find any spilled BP oil , which means the concentration was less than two parts per billion . -LRB- These researchers and others have developed techniques to `` fingerprint '' oil , so they can tell fairly accurately whether oil found in the gulf came from the BP well or elsewhere . -RRB- Another team of researchers , from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , reported that underwater plumes of oil - that is , oil that had n't reached the surface - may be breaking down at a slower rate . But these researchers have n't found many plumes in the last six months , suggesting that they probably are n't having a significant ecological impact at this point . It 's too soon to declare a happy , green ending to this story . We do n't really know how the chemicals that bacteria release after eating oil will affect human and animal health . Some of them are known to mimic testosterone and estrogen . It 's possible , although somewhat unlikely , that these compounds hamper endocrine functions at exceedingly low concentrations . Another concern is oil that has been trapped in sediment . Bacteria in open water work much more efficiently than their mud-based cousins , because the latter have less access to oxygen and nutrients . That 's one of the many reasons the spill response was so focused on preventing the muck from making landfall . The bacteria in marshlands and other coastal areas are still breaking down oil . Recovery workers are experimenting with techniques to help them along , for example by using aeration tubes to pump in oxygen and nutrients . And although the oil mostly disappeared several months ago , an untold number of fish , aquatic mammals and birds died in the disaster . It will probably take generations before their populations return to pre-spill levels . If only mammals could reproduce like bacteria .

William K. Reilly , the commission 's other co-chairman , emphasized that it would be a mistake to focus just on the three companies involved in last year 's accident . `` The solution to the problem has to be industry-wide . '' Graham , who along with Reilly will testify before both the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Natural Resources Committe e on Jan. 26 , said he hoped the `` searing impact '' of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and its aftermath would `` override an ideological preference for less government , less government intrusion and less government cost '' that could impede legislative action . Both Louisiana Sens. Mary Landrieu -LRB- D -RRB- and David Vitter -LRB- R -RRB- endorsed the panel 's recommendation that 80 percent of the Clean Water Act fines and penalties linked to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill go to environmental restoration . Landrieu said it would give `` added ammunition '' to a proposal that already has White House support . But in a sign of how the two parties remain divided on how to regulate drilling , Landrieu said the report found a path forward for deepwater drilling while Vitter criticized it for failing to do so . `` The report could have easily said ` end of deepwater drilling , ' but it does n't , '' Landrieu told reporters in a conference call . `` I think that 's the really big takeaway - that this commission , having examined a horrible incident that occurred , has basically concluded that deepwater can be done safely . '' In an interview , Vitter said he was concerned the report `` did n't make any statement , any observation about the gulf still almost being shut down , nine months after the fact .

Several influential Republicans said Tuesday they would oppose measures that could curb domestic exploration . Rep. Doc Hastings -LRB- R-Wash . -RRB- , chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources , said in an interview that any new funding for federal oversight `` should come from the existing revenues that are created by offshore drilling '' rather than new industry fees . Rep. Fred Upton -LRB- R-Mich . -RRB- , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee , warned in a statement : `` Neither this nor any investigation should be used as political justification for a pre-determined agenda to limit affordable energy options for America . '' Sen. Mary L. Landrieu -LRB- D-La . -RRB- said `` the really big takeaway '' of the report was that the commission `` examined a horrible incident that occurred -LRB- and -RRB- basically concluded that deepwater can be done safely . '' The Obama administration has already changed the way the government oversees offshore drilling . It has created an investigations-and-review unit to probe wrongdoing within the agency as well as the petroleum industry ; separated leasing revenue collection from safety , environmental and regulatory enforcement ; and temporarily stopped issuing '' categorical exclusions , '' which exempt drilling proposals from detailed environmental reviews , as it evaluates the entire procedure . Reilly , who said this overhaul is `` not enough , '' briefed Obama , several Cabinet secretaries and the rest of the commission members Tuesday . The president did not specify which recommendations he would adopt , Reilly said , and urged the panel members `` to engage industry support for some of these recommendations . '' Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- , who helped lead a probe of the BP spill on the Energy and Commerce Committee , said Tuesday he will introduce legislation encapsulating the commission 's recommendations along with some provisions that passed the House last year but failed to move in the Senate . Sen. David Vitter -LRB- R-La . -RRB- said he thought one factor would determine whether Congress passed an energy bill that could include some of these reforms : `` It 's really going to be the price at the pump , and that 's heating up again . '' Any such bill , he suggested , would not curb offshore drilling . Environmental groups immediately protested that the recommendations do not go far enough , and industry groups argued that the government should stop standing in the way of offshore drilling and production . While calling for tougher government regulation , the commission also called for the oil and gas industry to establish a `` self-policing '' organization that would set and enforce safety standards . In addition , it endorsed a system used in the North Sea that calls on drilling companies to assess the risks involved in a particular well and tailor their operations accordingly . University of Maryland law professor Rena Steinzor , president of the Center for Progressive Reform , said such deference to the companies would be `` tragedy compounded , '' adding , `` If there ever was an industry that did n't deserve to write its own plans , it 's this one . '' The panel recommended boosting the liability cap on oil spills , which is $ 75 million for environmental and economic damage , though the commissioners could not agree on a specific number . BP has said that it would disregard the cap . The commission 's report said that Interior should also include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the decision-making process about where and how to conduct oil and gas leasing . If Interior officials were to reject NOAA 's recommendations , they would have to say in writing why the action would be in the national interest . "}]
