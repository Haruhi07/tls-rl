The initiative aims to lower salt content in food and restrict the promotion of alcoholic drinks . Leading supermarkets , fast food firms and drinks companies have signed pledges to co-operate in `` Responsibility Deal '' commitments with the Department of Health . Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the pledges were part of the government 's `` bold new approach to public health , '' avoiding new legislation and relying on self-policing by industry . `` We know that regulation is costly , can take years and is often only determined at an EU-wide level anyway , '' Lansley said . Health groups like the British Heart Foundation and the British Liver Trust have largely stayed away from the program , arguing it is soft on the food and drink industry and lacks the teeth to ensure companies stick to their promises . Supermarket ASDA said it would remove all alcohol promotions from the front of its stores from April , while Morrisons said it will provide a minimum of 50 special price offers every week on fresh fruit and vegetables . Fast food outlets including McDonald 's , Pizza Hut and KFC pledged to remove harmful trans-fats from their meals and to include calorie labeling , the health department said . Drinks firms Diageo and Carlsberg will support alcohol awareness campaigns and develop a new sponsorship code on responsible drinking . Other pledges include reducing salt in food and putting clear unit-labelling on 80 percent of alcohol by 2013 . Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation said they would not join the scheme until there was more robust monitoring of the commitments . `` We are disappointed that the Responsibility Deal is not more ambitious in its vision as many of the pledges replicate existing standards , '' said Diabetes UK chief executive Barbara Young . Six health organizations fighting alcohol abuse announced on Monday they were boycotting the program . Alcohol Concern said the scheme was `` the worst possible deal for everyone '' seeking to curb drinking abuse .

The operator of the quake-crippled plant said workers were trying to put out the blaze at the building housing the No. 4 reactor of the nuclear facility in Fukushima , 240 km -LRB- 150 miles -RRB- north of Tokyo . Experts say spent fuel rods in a cooling pool at the reactor could be exposed by the fire and spew more radiation into the atmosphere . Japan 's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said two workers were missing after blasts at the facility a day earlier blew a hole in the building housing the No. 4 reactor . In the first hint of international frustration at the pace of updates from Japan , Yukiya Amano , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , said he wanted more timely and detailed information . `` We do not have all the details of the information so what we can do is limited , '' Amano told a news conference in Vienna . `` I am trying to further improve the communication . '' The U.S. Department of Energy said it had sent a team of 34 people to help Japan with the crisis . Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan on Tuesday urged people within 30 km -LRB- 18 miles -RRB- of the facility -- a population of 140,000 -- to remain indoors , as authorities grappled with the world 's most serious nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986 . Officials in Tokyo said radiation in the capital was 10 times normal at one point but not a threat to human health in the sprawling high-tech city of 13 million people . Toxicologist Lee Tin-lap at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said such a radiation level was not an immediate threat to people but the long-term consequences were unknown . `` You are still breathing this into your lungs , and there is passive absorption in the skin , eyes and mouth and we really do not know what long-term impact that would have , '' Lee told Reuters by telephone . Winds over the plant will blow from the north along the Pacific coast early on Wednesday and then from the northwest towards the ocean during the day , the Japan Meteorological Agency said . Fears of trans-Pacific nuclear fallout sent consumers scrambling for radiation antidotes in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Canada . Authorities warned people would expose themselves to other medical problems by needlessly taking potassium iodide in the hope of protection from cancer . The nuclear crisis and concerns about the economic impact from last week 's earthquake and tsunami hammered Japan 's stock market on Tuesday . The Nikkei index fell as much as 14 percent before ending down 10.6 percent , compounding a slide of 6.2 percent the day before . The two-day fall has wiped some $ 620 billion off the market . Authorities have spent days desperately trying to prevent the water which is designed to cool the radioactive cores of the reactors from evaporating , which would lead to overheating and the release of dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere . `` The possibility of further radioactive leakage is heightening , '' a grim-faced Kan said in his address to the nation on Tuesday . `` We are making every effort to prevent the leak from spreading . I know that people are very worried but I would like to ask you to act calmly . '' Levels of 400 millisieverts per hour had been recorded near the No. 4 reactor , the government said . Exposure to over 100 millisieverts a year is a level which can lead to cancer , according to the World Nuclear Association . The plant operator , Tokyo Electric Power Co. , pulled out 750 workers , leaving just 50 , and a 30-km -LRB- 19 mile -RRB- no-fly zone was imposed around the reactors . There have been no detailed updates on what levels the radiation reached inside the exclusion zone . A Reuters reporter using a Geiger counter showed negligible levels of radiation in the capital late on Tuesday . Despite pleas for calm , residents rushed to shops in Tokyo to stock up on supplies . Don Quixote , a multi-storey , 24-hour general store in Roppongi district , sold out of radios , flashlights , candles and sleeping bags . In a sign of regional fears about the risk of radiation , China said it would evacuate its citizens from areas worst affected but it had detected no abnormal radiation levels at home . Air China said it had canceled some flights to Tokyo . The U.S. Navy said some arriving warships would deploy on the west coast of Japan 's main Honshu island instead of heading to the east coast as planned because of `` radiological and navigation hazards . '' Several embassies advised staff and citizens to leave affected areas in Japan . Tourists cut short vacations and multinational companies either urged staff to leave or said they were considering plans to move outside Tokyo . German technology companies SAP and Infineon were among those moving staff to safety in the south . SAP said it was evacuating its offices in Tokyo , Osaka and Nagoya and had offered its 1,100 employees and their family members transport to the south , where the company has rented a hotel for staff to work online . `` Everyone is going out of the country today , '' said Gunta Brunner , a 25-year-old creative director from Argentina preparing to board a flight at Narita airport . `` With the radiation , it 's like you can not escape and you ca n't see it . '' `` WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ? '' Japanese media have became more critical of Kan 's handling of the disaster and criticised the government and the nuclear plant operator for their failure to provide enough information on the incident . Kan himself lambasted the operator for taking so long to inform his office about one of the blasts on Tuesday , Kyodo news agency reported . Kyodo said Kan had ordered TEPCO not to pull employees out of the plant . `` The TV reported an explosion . But nothing was said to the premier 's office for about an hour , '' a Kyodo reporter quoted Kan telling power company executives . `` What the hell is going on ? '' Nuclear radiation is an especially sensitive issue for Japanese following the country 's worst human catastrophe -- the U.S. atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 . There have been a total of four explosions at the plant since it was damaged in last Friday 's massive quake and tsunami . The most recent were blasts at reactors Nos. 2 and 4 . Concern now centres on damage to a part of the No. 4 reactor building where spent rods were being stored in pools of water outside the containment area , and also to part of the No. 2 reactor that helps to cool and trap the majority of cesium , iodine and strontium in its water . Before Tuesday 's explosion the temperature in Number 4 reactor 's cooling pool was 84 C , higher than normal due to a lack of electricity after the quake , said Hidehiko Nishiyama , chief spokesman of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency . Since then the temperature had been rising and there was a possibility that it was boiling , he said . It would take 7-10 days for the water to boil away , leaving the spent fuel rods exposed to the air , said Kazuya Aoki , a director for safety examination . As long as the spent fuel rods were covered with water there should be no leak of radioactive material from them , he said . Officials were considering options including using helicopters to pour water into the reactor pool , though the openings created by the explosion were on the north and west sides of the reactor , making it difficult to access from above . VILLAGES AND TOWNS WIPED OFF THE MAP The full extent of the destruction from last Friday 's 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the tsunami that followed it was becoming clear as rescuers combed through the region north of Tokyo where officials say at least 10,000 people were killed . Whole villages and towns have been wiped off the map by Friday 's wall of water , triggering an international humanitarian effort of epic proportions . A 6.4-magnitude aftershock -- a significant earthquake in its own right on any other day -- shook buildings in Tokyo late on Tuesday but caused no damage . About 850,000 households in the north were still without electricity in near-freezing weather , Tohuku Electric Power Co. said , and the government said at least 1.5 million households lack running water . Tens of thousands of people were missing . Hiromichi Shirakawa , chief economist for Japan at Credit Suisse , said in a note to clients that the economic loss will likely be around 14-15 trillion yen -LRB- $ 171-183 billion -RRB- just to the region hit by the quake and tsunami . The earthquake has forced many firms to suspend production and global companies -- from semiconductor makers to shipbuilders -- face disruptions to operations after the quake and tsunami destroyed vital infrastructure , damaged ports and knocked out factories . `` The earthquake could have great implications on the global economic front , '' said Andre Bakhos , director of market analytics at Lec Securities in New York . `` If you shut down Japan , there could be a global recession .

The findings of the `` Fair Pay Review '' are designed to halt a decade-long trend which has seen pay at the top of the public sector grow faster than pay levels at the bottom . Prime Minister David Cameron asked Will Hutton , a left-leaning commentator and former head of the Work Foundation , to conduct the review last year . Scrutiny of high-earning executives has intensified ever since the government was forced to bail out the banking sector with public funds . Most public anger has been directed at bank chief executives , labeled `` fat cats '' in the media , but top-earning public sector chiefs have not been immune . In an interim report last December , Hutton set out a case for a maximum pay multiple that would keep the pay of top executives bound to what their staff earned , with a 20:1 ratio the maximum . In Tuesday 's final report , Hutton moves away from this idea . Instead he proposes that public sector executives place at least 10 percent of their salary at risk in an `` earnback '' scheme , which can only be reclaimed if targets are met . If targets are exceeded , the same proportion could be earned as a bonus . `` I am recommending that all public service executives are required to place an element of their basic pay at risk , to be earned back each year through good performance , '' Hutton said . The report also recommends that public bodies publish , and justify , the multiple of chief executive to workforce median pay -- a step it argues should also be adopted by the private sector . `` Organisations delivering public services should publish their pay multiples each year , and disclose and explain executive pay and how it relates to job responsibilities and individual performance , '' Hutton said . The government , eager for a framework to curb what Hutton has called an `` arms race '' - like scramble to increase remuneration for high-earners , is likely to welcome the recommendations . But Unison , Britain 's largest trade union , said the review did not go far enough . `` The focus on top pay is a missed opportunity . To really boost fairness in the public sector , and our society as a whole , we need to tackle low wages -- not just income inequality , '' Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis said .

N -RRB- is increasing the sources of capital it taps as it gears up to raise its next buyout fund , the company said at its first ever investor day on Tuesday . KKR , which raised an $ 18 billion global buyout fund in 2006 , is just starting to raise a new North American-focused fund with a target size of $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion . Private equity firms raise capital that they typically use to buy companies , turn them around and sell for a higher price , returning the profit to the investors that supplied the capital . The credit crisis limited dealflow and made raising capital for new funds hard , as investors were less willing and able to commit capital to new funds . The harder fundraising environment has caused funds have to search out new investors . Nuttall said that KKR , which has 350 fund investors or `` limited partners , '' is working on adding more . Arch-rival Blackstone Group -LRB- BX . N -RRB- has more than 1,300 , a source close to the company said . `` It is incumbent on us -- and we will do this in the next fundraise that we are in process of doing for North America -- to find other sources of capital that are not invested in us , '' co-founder and co-Chief Executive George Roberts said . More money is being attracted to the alternative investment space , increasingly from new investors , co-founder and co-CEO Henry Kravis said . KKR said it has more than $ 11 billion of `` dry powder , '' or capital available to invest , and sees potential deals around the world . `` We believe that is incredible capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see in private equity around the globe , '' said Alexander Navab , KKR 's co-head of North American private equity . Leveraged buyouts -- the debt-fueled deals private equity is known for -- have been increasing in the past year as financing for deals has become easier to find . KKR said North America is attractive for private equity , with improved credit markets and `` generally reasonable '' equity valuations . The company 's European head said KKR sees opportunities in France and the financial services sector . In Asia , KKR cited opportunities in China and said Japan looks attractive from a pure valuation point of view . It is seeking large transactions in markets such as Australia , Singapore , Korea , Japan and India . KKR 's $ 11 billion includes $ 3.5 billion of uncommitted capital remaining in its 2006 fund , which will probably prove one of the strongest of its vintage , said Michael Michelson , co-head of North American private equity . KKR also raised more than $ 1 billion for a China fund in record time for the firm , Navab said . However , its European Fund II is valued at 93 percent of cost , which KKR described as `` disappointing -LRB- but -RRB- an improvement on 2009 . '' Roberts said KKR probably paid too much for a couple of deals , which was `` probably why Europe II is still not performing '' as it thinks it should . In November Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher suggested that a bubble is forming in private equity , with cheap debt fueling high-priced deals in an echo of the torrid days of LBOs before the subprime credit crisis cut off financing in 2007 . KKR remains focused on buyouts even though it has expanded over the past few years into areas such as real estate and capital markets . `` Private equity is our heritage , our core business , and we 've been able to build a number of businesses around it , '' Scott Nuttall , global head of capital and asset management , said at the event , which was attended by about 100 investors . KKR said it was confident its new long-short team would be in the market soon and raise significant capital over time . Last October , KKR hired nine members of Goldman Sachs Group Inc 's -LRB- GS . N -RRB- proprietary trading team . `` Buyout king '' Kravis , who co-founded KKR nearly 35 years ago , said he and co-founder Roberts think about succession issues every day but added that their stepping down , `` I hope is in the distant future . '' KKR has a deep bench of potential successors , Kravis said . KKR listed on the New York Stock Exchange on July 15 , joining rival Blackstone Group LP -LRB- BX . N -RRB- , which made its debut in 2007 . Shares of KKR fell 4 percent to close at $ 16.59 on the New York Stock Exchange . Other large private equity firms such Carlyle Group CYL . UL and Apollo Management APOLO . UL are also likely to go public . Apollo is expected to set terms soon for an IPO of up to $ 500 million , sources told Reuters late on Monday . Private equity firms going public have sometimes been questioned by investors concerned about whether their interests will be aligned . Roberts said that forward-thinking investors realize that `` over the next five years the other established private equity firms will be public in one form or another ... this is a trend and is probably in their best interests as well .

Opponents of the current libel laws say they make it too easy for the rich and powerful to bring cases in Britain -- or to use the threat of expensive action to stifle free speech . `` London has become the world 's libel capital . Foreign claimants with insignificant connections with this country use our courts to silence critics , when accused of activities such as funding terrorism and dumping toxic waste in Africa , '' Anthony Lester , a barrister who has championed libel reform , wrote in the Times newspaper . The first draft of a bill put forward by ministers on Tuesday proposes reforming current laws to allow courts to strike out trivial claims , and making it harder to bring to court overseas claims that have little connection to Britain . It also includes a new public interest defense and recommends a single publication rule , so that repeat claims for libel could not be made every time a publication is accessed on the internet . `` For too long our outdated libel laws gave made it easy for the powerful and the wealthy to stifle fair criticism , '' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said in a statement . `` We can not continue to tolerate a culture in which scientists , journalists and bloggers are afraid to tackle issues of public importance for fear of being sued . '' Scientists and academics in particular argue the current law allows powerful corporations to use the threat of civil action to suppress debate , and some argue that corporations and public bodies should be prevented from suing for libel altogether . The draft bill did not recommend this and ministers said they focussed on changing the `` inequality of arms '' that prevents the poor from suing over defamation or from publishing freely without fear of being unable to mount a defense against cases brought by the wealthy . The proposed bill did not include provisions over internet publication . Minister of State Lord McNally said he expected a three-month consultation , which now follows publication of the first draft , would help to refine laws in this area .

That , at least , is what the world s autocrats are learning from the example of Bashar al-Assad , the president of Syria . First , his wife , Asma al-Assad , was the subject of a glowing profile in the March issue of the U.S. edition of Vogue , which described this rose in the desert as the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies and reported on the wildly democratic principles that govern family life chez Assad . Now , the Harvard Arab Alumni Association has organized an event in Damascus , under the patronage of Mrs. Assad , who was scheduled to deliver a keynote address on Thursday . On Wednesday , the day before the planned Harvard alumni event , security officers beat and detained a group of nonviolent demonstrators who gathered to call for the release of the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 political prisoners in the country . On its Web site earlier this week , the Harvard Arab Alumni Association highlighted its connection with the dictator s wife : We are greatly honored to hold our Arab World Conference under the esteemed patronage of Her Excellency Mrs. Asma al-Assad , The First Lady of Syria , and are privileged that Her Excellency will deliver the conference s keynote address . A thought-provoking , inspiring and tireless leader and advocate , the First Lady s address will certainly be the highlight of our event . The Web site was enthusiastic about Mrs. Assad s role in Syrian national life and the connection between her work and that of her husband s regime : In her role as Syria s first lady , Her Excellency Asma al-Assad applies her experience , energy and influence to her country s social and cultural development . Her role reflects the significant economic , political and social change that is happening in Syria today . Asma al-Assad s work supports that of President Bashar al-Assad by fostering the emergence of a robust , independent and self-sustaining civil society . According to a Human Rights Watch report released in January , the Syrian authorities were among the worst violators of human rights in the world in 2010 , torturing their opponents , imprisoning lawyers and violently repressing ethnic Kurds . Human Rights Watch said it had credible reports that security agencies arbitrarily detained dissidents and criminal suspects , held them incommunicado . It also said that those detained were subjected to ill - treatment and torture . Nadim Houry , the senior researcher on Syria and Lebanon for Human Rights Watch , said the prominent role for Mrs. Assad was part of a general charm offensive . He took particular issue with the Harvard Arab Alumni Association Web site s reference to the first family s support for independent civil society . This is definitely crossing the line , he said . There is nothing independent and nothing self-sustaining about what the government is doing with civil society in Syria . Richard N. Haass , president of the Council on Foreign Relations , said he was surprised that Syria which effectively occupied Lebanon for almost 30 years , allied itself with Iran and aided groups like Hamas had faced less scrutiny than other local dictatorships . It is ironic that it has escaped , for the most part , criticism , Dr. Haass said . The Harvard Arab Alumni Association s Web site includes a disclaimer describing itself as an independent , not-for-profit organization and stating : Nothing that is published by the HAAA should be taken to represent the opinions or endorsement of Harvard University , the President and Fellows of Harvard College , or the Harvard Alumni Association . According to the program , six people with Harvard affiliations were scheduled to speak at or moderate sessions at the daylong event , including the Harvard Guest Address , one of three keynote speeches , to be delivered by Jorge Dominguez , Harvard s vice provost for international affairs . In an e-mail , John Longbrake , a Harvard spokesman , said that the Harvard Arab Alumni Association was an independent organization but that we are supportive of any alumni group that hosts a conference encouraging open dialogue and the exploration of ideas . In his talk , Professor Dominguez will be highlighting Harvard s engagement in the Arab world and discussing the value of freedom of inquiry and why liberty of the mind builds a democratic society , Mr. Longbrake wrote . The positive references to the Syrian government in a conference with Harvard involvement provoked intense debate among U.S. political scientists this week , with one e-mailing a colleague to say it was shocking and disgusting . But others said the event highlighted how hard it was to strike precisely the right balance between engaging authoritarian regimes and appearing to legitimize them . To me , the real challenge is to navigate simultaneously working with governments and civil society , said Anne - Marie Slaughter , a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University . UPDATE : I had e-mailed Harvard Professor Jorge Dominguez on Wednesday asking for his thoughts on the Harvard Arab Alumni Association event , but my deadline passed before we had an opportunity to connect . Subsequently Professor Dominguez sent me the following e-mail outlining the subject of his keynote speech . What follows is not a response to my column since he has not yet had a chance to read it , but rather a bit of supplementary information . `` I spoke this morning on several themes . One is Harvard s long engagement with the Arab world , which started with the teaching of the Arabic language sporadically since the late 17th century and regularly since an endowment for that purpose was established 75 years ago . Similarly , Harvard s library resources in Arabic are approximately 270,000 volumes , which makes it the largest research university library collection in Arabic materials in the world . Moving closer to the present , I noted that we ve increased the number of students from the Arab world from 47 to 96 over the past decade , and discussed how the University s admissions and financial aid policies span the world . Harvard is the best university in the world for a poor person . `` I went on to discuss the meaning of education . Some examples are case-based student-focused learning of the type evident in case discussions in our professional schools -LRB- business , law , public policy -RRB- . There is no right or wrong answer to such discussions but , rather , a vigorous analysis of varying approaches . `` Then , I illustrated my own understanding of a liberal education in terms of a course I teach , in which in each lecture I present an argument and deliver it as persuasively as I can , only to have it contradicted in subsequent lectures where the lecture is also delivered as persuasively as I can . I noted that in exams and papers I never ask for the right answer because each student must be able to formulate two answers . I described how competition between ideas and interpretation is a key to free inquiry in any society , and how the liberty of the mind , open to the world , is both the most effective way to learn about citizenship as well as professional life , and to construct a democratic society . Finally , I turned to research in various endeavors that Harvard faculty and students carry out in various parts of the Arab world . `` I closed by praising the Harvard Arab Alumni Association for bringing the discussion to a city in the Arab world , to build on the value of freedom of inquiry and competition between ideas and interpretations through the manner in which they built the conference program . There were several panelists per panel and a vigorous moderator who kept the dynamics going and prevented ossified speeches . Each session had a good chunk of time for many questions and comments where , of course , the recent developments across the Arab world were raised and addressed . The HAAA deserved praise , therefore , for bringing vigorous debate to a discussion in an Arab city about problems in the Arab world , presumably a value many of your readers may share as well . '' The only thing being discussed is that there was an assassination and Syria was involved in it . How come Syria is in Lebanon in the first place ? Why did the US welcome Syria in Lebanon in 1976 ? Why did George Bush I support Syrian presence and domination and influence in Lebanon in 1991 as part of his campaign against Iraq ? Why did the US support the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 ? Why did the US support Israel s 22 year occupation of parts of Lebanon , an occupation in violation of Security Council resolutions ? All these topics , and many others , are missing from the discussion . In fact , the general principle is that anything that places US actions in a questionable light is omitted , with very rare exceptions . So if you blame something on an enemy , then you can discuss it , and Syria , right now is the official enemy . That doesn t necessarily mean that the charges against Syria are wrong . It just means that everything else is omitted . The problem for the US is that Syria is not a subordinate state . There are a lot of serious criticisms you can make about Syria , but the internal problems of that country are of no special concern to the US , which supports much more brutal governments . The problem with Syria is that it simply does not subordinate itself to the US program in the Middle East . Syria and Iran are the two countries in the region that have not accepted US economic arrangements . Thank you for saying what needed to be said Noam . I am guessing there were many other comments similar to yours that were removed by moderators because their names did n't have marquis billing . Watching recent events throughout the Arab world and it is plain to see that U.S. puppets are largely excluded from any meaningful regime changes while the US and it 's corporate allies encourage the ones that displace socialist revolutionary regimes like Libya 's . Syria and Venezuela will be next , while Egypt 's ongoing dictatorship will be allowed to remain , along with Bahrain , Yemen , Jordan and every other pliable client state . Newscorp and Reuters need to stop playing along with corporate spin and read a few good books by yourself and William Blum to get some perspective . Well , the real problem with Syria is that does n't even come close to observing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Being that it is truly `` Universal '' , it is not biased towards the US economic arrangements or any other US issue . States do n't have to be `` subordinate '' to the US to follow the UDHR . They do n't have to agree with the US on military or economic policy . Actually the opposite is the case , when countries move to observing the UDHR they tend to be in less conflict with their neighbors , less antagonistic towards the `` western world '' . It is not a surprise that when Venezuela moved from generally observing the UDHR to a gross violator of the UDHR they also became antagonistic of the US . When they get democracy back & resume observing the UDHR they will likely be more friendly with the US . That does n't mean they will be subservient to the US . BTW , which governments that are `` more brutal '' than the Baath regime does the US support . I realize under Obama 's `` reach out to genocidal maniacs '' policy , he was trying to cuddle up to Syria but now Sadam has gone it is hard to see a worse regime in the Middle East . At least Hizbollah builds hospitals . Firstly , I greatly envy those who had Professor Dominguez for a college professor . I hope his students realize their good fortune . Secondly , as demonstrated by Iraq and Afghanistan , the expenditures of military might , vast sums of wealth and diplomatic energies result in only a modest effect on entrenched social and political forces . Selectively promoting changes in political leadership in a few countries that are ripe for the process will likely promote a gradual positive change in the regimes that remain ; America 's current endeavors are likely to eventually yield better results than war at a much lower cost .

Security Council voted on Thursday to authorise a no-fly zone over Libya and `` all necessary measures '' -- code for military action -- to protect civilians from Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . Here are some questions and answers on the no-fly zone . WHEN WOULD ANY OPERATION START ? Diplomatic sources in France , which favors more aggressive action against Gaddafi , say military action could come as soon as Friday and could include France , Britain , possibly the United States and one or more Arab states . But a U.S. military official said no immediate U.S. action was expected following the vote . It is unclear exactly how long it would take to arrange the military operations needed to enforce the no-fly zone . Last week , the head of U.S. Joint Forces Command said the Pentagon could implement a no-fly zone ` within a couple of days . ' But on Thursday , U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz said it would take `` upwards of a week . '' WHAT FORCES WOULD BE INVOLVED ? Gulf or Arab League countries have warships and fighter aircraft , but have shown little capability to deploy those forces outside their region and Gulf countries are distracted by the crisis in Bahrain . Schwartz , speaking to the U.S. Senate on Thursday , said there were `` nations within the Arab League with capable air forces that under the right circumstances might be brought to bear . '' Diplomats have said that among Arab League members , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar may be prepared to take part in enforcing a no-fly zone . If the United States chose not to get involved , Britain and France probably have the military capabilities to mount a limited no-fly zone or maritime exclusion zone . NATO nations , whatever the arrangement , might ask for the use of air bases in Italy . An Italian government source told Reuters on Thursday that Italy was ready to make its military bases available to enforce a no-fly zone . But U.S. officials believe the Pentagon , with its extensive air and sea assets , would do the heavy lifting . WHAT EQUIPMENT MIGHT THE PENTAGON USE ? The United States , if it decides to enforce a no-fly zone , would likely be required to pull air assets from Europe and the United States , officials say , and possibly even from Iraq and Afghanistan . Some commanders fear that could tax a military already stretched by two wars and , now , aid efforts in Japan . `` There are limited intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance assets , '' Schwartz said . The United States would likely use bombers and fighter planes , possibly including F-16s , F-15s and F-22s , to strike ground targets , Schwartz said . It would also deploy surveillance planes , aerial refuelling planes , satellite communication equipment and aircraft capable of jamming Libyan communications . WOULD IT BE EFFECTIVE IN STOPPING GADDAFI ? As time passes , fewer people believe a no-fly zone would be decisive on the ground . Government forces have relied mainly on artillery barrages followed by advances by tanks and other ground forces to drive back rebels , and NATO warplanes flying over Libya might be unable to protect civilians on the ground . In a sign of reservations within the U.S. military , Schwartz said a no-fly zone alone would not be sufficient to reverse the momentum of Gaddafi 's troops . It would be a major challenge to enforce a no-fly zone over all of Libya , with a land area some 35 times that of Bosnia , where NATO implemented a no-fly zone in the early 1990s . Officials might choose to set up a more limited area around the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi , using a smaller number of combat and support aircraft . WHAT EQUIPMENT DOES GADDAFI HAVE ? Last week , U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Gaddafi had about 80 operational aircraft -- a mix of helicopters , transport aircraft and fighter jets . Schwartz said there were `` multiple tens of combat aircraft '' and helicopters numbering in the `` low hundreds '' that had been flying `` tens '' of sorties a day . But Libyan aircraft , which Clapper said relied on visual rather than computer targeting , is far less sophisticated than the planes and helicopters flown by U.S. counterparts . The International Institute for Strategic Studies , a London-based think tank , estimates Gaddafi has as few as 40 fixed-wing aircraft and the bulk of his air force 's equipment is obsolescent in Western terms . WOULD THE FOREIGN FORCE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT AIR DEFENSES ? There is some disagreement about this . Defense Secretary Robert Gates says it would be necessary before U.S. aircraft could mount patrols over Libya . Opponents of the no-fly zone say that would be an act of war . Others believe pre-emptive strikes against Libya 's outdated Soviet surface-to-air missiles would not be needed and NATO warplanes could wait until Libyan radar `` locked on '' to them . Clapper said Libya had the second largest air defense system in the Middle East , with about 31 surface-to-air missile sites and a large number of portable surface-to-air missiles .

The demonstrators also set ablaze the main courts complex and two phone company branches . One of the firms , Syriatel , is owned by President Bashar al-Assad 's cousin Rami Makhlouf . `` They burned the symbols of oppression and corruption , '' an activist said . `` The banks nearby were not touched . '' Assad , who has strengthened Syria 's ties with Shi'ite Iran as he sought to improve relations with the United States and strike a peace deal with Israel to return the Golan Heights , is facing the biggest challenge to his rule since he succeeded his late father , Hafez al-Assad , 11 years ago . He has sent government officials to try to placate Deraa but thousands rallied to demand an end to emergency law in the southern city , on the third consecutive day of protests against Syria 's ruling Baath Party . `` No , no to emergency law . We are a people infatuated with freedom , '' marchers chanted , despite the arrival in Deraa of a government delegation to pay condolences to relatives of victims killed by security forces in demonstrations there this week . Security forces fired tear gas at the protesters . Around 40 people were taken to be treated for gas inhalation at the main Omari mosque in the old city , residents said . `` The mosque is now a field hospital . The security forces know they can not enter the old city without spilling more blood , '' one resident said . Syria has been under emergency law since the Baath Party , which is headed by president Bashar al-Assad , took power 1963 and banned all opposition . Makhlouf is under specific U.S. sanctions for what Washington regards as public corruption and has been a target of protesters chanting `` thief . '' He owns several large businesses . The protesters were in control of the old quarters of Deraa by nightfall , with heavy security presence in the rest of the city , which is near the border with Jordan . Security forces opened fire on Friday on civilians taking part in a peaceful protest in Deraa demanding the release of 15 schoolchildren detained for writing protest graffiti , political freedoms and an end to corruption . Four people were killed . An official statement said `` infiltrators '' claiming to be high ranking officers had been visiting security stations and asking security forces to fire at any suspicious gathering . Citizens should report anyone suspected of trying to fool the security apparatus `` into using violence and live ammunition against any suspicious gathering , '' the statement said . The government sought to calm discontent by promising to release immediately the 15 children , who had written slogans on walls inspired by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt . The statement was a rare instance of Syria 's ruling hierarchy responding to popular pressure . Tens of people arrested on Friday have been released , but scores more were still in jail , activists said . On Saturday , thousands of mourners called for `` revolution '' at the funeral of two of the protesters . Officials later met Deraa notables who presented then with a list of demands . It included the release of political prisoners , dismantling of secret police headquarters in Deraa , dismissal of the governor , public trial for those responsible for the killings and scrapping of regulations requiring permission from the secret police to sell and buy property . Non-violent protests have challenged the Baath Party 's authority this month , with the largest protests in Deraa drawing thousands of people . A silent protest in Damascus by 150 people this week demanded the release of thousands of political prisoners . At least one activist from Deraa , Diana al-Jawabra , took part in the protest . She was arrested on charges of weakening national morale , along with 32 other protesters , a lawyer said . Jawabra , who is from a prominent family , was campaigning for the release of the 15 schoolchildren from her home city . Another woman from Deraa , physician Aisha Aba Zeid , was arrested three weeks ago for airing a political opinion on the internet . Residents say the two arrests helped fuel the protests in Deraa , a conservative tribal region . Graffiti have appeared on school walls and grain silos in Deraa with phrases such as `` the people want the overthrow of the regime '' -- the slogan that became the rallying cry of the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions . Authorities responded by increasing secret police patrols and asking staff at schools and public departments to man their premises around the clock and by requiring IDs and registration for buyers of paint and spray cans . `` These measures only increased popular resentment , '' one Deraa resident said .

At least four people have been killed in the protests and demonstrators have set fire to public buildings in open defiance of authorities known for tolerating no dissent . Serious unrest has been confined to the southern city of Deraa , echoing to the chants of `` God , Syria , Freedom , '' but analysts say disenchantment at Assad 's rule and the exhilarating spirit of regional upheaval may fuel wider rebellion . `` It is a semi-totalitarian state ... corruption is everywhere , '' said Hazem Saghieh , columnist at pan-Arab Al-Hayat newspaper . `` All the reasons are there to expect drastic change . '' Any turmoil in Syria would have an impact well beyond its borders . Under Assad and his father before him , Syria has been Iran 's closest Arab ally , a major force in Lebanon , and a supporter of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups . The Baath Party , which seized power nearly 50 years ago , has governed under emergency laws and banned all opposition . Other grievances against authorities include the dominance of Assad 's minority Alawites over the Sunni Muslim majority , corruption , economic hardship and a rising cost of living . Assad has said Syria 's foreign policy -- hardline opposition to Israel and support for its foes Hamas and Hezbollah -- means that uniquely among Arab rulers , he is in tune with the mood of his people on one of the most resonant Arab causes . But this so-called `` Syrian exception '' may offer little protection from protesters focussed on domestic demands for more rights , jobs and better living standards . When the Muslim Brotherhood staged an armed revolt against the late Hafez al-Assad , he sent troops into Hama , killing many thousands and razing part of the city to the ground in 1982 . Such sustained repression -- the military operation in Hama took weeks and was completed before the outside world learned its full extent -- may not be an option in an era where mobile phone footage of protests reaches the Internet in minutes . `` The Syrians have shown in the past they are capable of calibrating repression with flexibility , '' said Habib Malik , history professor at the Lebanese American University . `` I think they realize what happened in Hama is not possible in today 's world , '' he said , adding that the challenge to Assad , although grave , may still be `` contained or nipped in the bud . '' Like other Arab states trying to contain dissent , Syria has reversed decisions on lifting subsidies and has raised salaries . Volker Perthes , director of the German Institute for International Politics and Security , said it could also defuse tensions in restive Kurdish regions in the northeast by implementing a pledge to grant citizenship to stateless Kurds . A diplomat in Damascus said Assad , who was elected president unopposed when his father died in 2000 , had repeatedly stalled on promised political reform and mistakenly believed that limited economic liberalisation was the key to survival . `` They have been trying to put economic band-aids on a wound gushing with the blood of frustration , '' the diplomat said . `` Bashar had the time to take pre-emptive moves and embark on genuine reform . Instead the regime is making very bad mistakes . '' Smaller , possibly coordinated , demonstrations took place after Friday prayers in the central city of Homs and the coastal town of Banias , while a crowd briefly chanted slogans for freedom inside the Ummayad Mosque in Damascus . A peaceful demonstration for the release of political prisoners was broken up in Damascus last week . But the scale of the protests in Deraa , where thousands of people have taken to the streets , suggests the real threat to Assad comes less from Syria 's scattered and weakened opposition groups than from spontaneous grassroots protest . If Libyan rebels , now backed by Western military power , make further gains in their fight against Muammar Gaddafi , Syrian protesters would be further emboldened , Saghieh said . Demonstrations could then intensify throughout the country , and few expect Assad to follow Egyptian and Tunisian presidents who eventually yielded to mass protests and stood aside . `` I think a regime like the Baath regime in Syria would not leave smoothly . It would opt for something like Libya or Yemen , '' said Saghieh . `` If it is civil war and anarchy , no one would benefit . Iranians would lose their ally , but the Israelis would have on their borders a very volatile situation , '' he said . Since 2005 , when the United States withdrew its ambassador to Damascus after the assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri , Assad has engineered a rapprochement with the West , but maintained a hard line against criticism at home . He has said he is willing to resume peace talks with Israel , insisting on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights occupied in 1967 , while continuing to position Syria as a champion of Arab resistance to Israel . `` The Syrian exception has long rested on the regime 's skill in developing a foreign policy in synch with public opinion -- a unique case in the Arab world . But popular sentiment has refocused around a host of domestic issues left unaddressed for too long , '' said Peter Harling , Damascus-based analyst with the International Crisis Group . `` Authorities currently face challenges akin to other regimes of the region , and for the time being are responding in similar fashion . The future now hinges on their ability to reinvent the Syrian exception , by staking out a credible and comprehensive vision for change , '' Harling added . `` Repression can only make a volatile situation worse .

Top generals , ambassadors and some tribes endorsed the goals of Yemen 's anti-government protesters in a glancing blow to President Ali Abdullah Saleh as he strove to withstand demands for his resignation after 32 years in power . Saleh , an important U.S. and Saudi ally in the world 's paramount oil-exporting region , has survived a civil war , tribal revolts and al Qaeda militant campaigns so far . However , the defections of major officials appeared to pose the gravest threat yet to his tenure , although some important military allies remained loyal . ' The three-month-old tide of revolt against Arab rulers seen as repressive , corrupt and unaccountable for unemployment and poverty reached Syria on Friday and gained momentum on Monday as rallies for `` freedom '' spread in the south . President Bashar al-Assad 's security forces killed four civilians in demonstrations that erupted in the southern city of Deraa on Friday , uncorking the sharpest challenge yet to his 11-year-old rule . His Baath Party has dominated Syria since 1963 . In Libya , where peaceful protests grew into insurrection within weeks , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces besieged the only major rebel city in the west and brought in human shields , residents of Misrata said , to ward off further Western air strikes meant to protect civilians . The first French and British sorties , backed by U.S. missile salvoes , at the weekend halted the Gaddafi forces ' advance on the rebels ' eastern power base of Benghazi and pounded Libyan air defenses to enforce a U.N.-declared no-fly zone . As Western forces prepared to shift from air strikes to air patrols , there was no sign of any gains on the ground by the loosely organized , poorly trained insurgents . Nevertheless , a senior official with the rebel National Council , based in Benghazi , said the rebels aimed to capture the capital Tripoli and drive out Gaddafi . He welcomed the no-fly zone but again said no foreign ground forces were wanted . International divisions over intervention in Libya flared into the open on Monday as leaders in Russia and China criticized the air strike policy which neither approved in the U.N. Security Council vote last week . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin compared the air strikes to `` medieval crusades , '' eliciting a rare rebuke from his protege , President Dmitry Medvedev , while China 's official media accused countries involved of inviting new upheaval in the Middle East . Turkey and Germany , both members of NATO , voiced further doubt and the Arab League was also divided . BAHRAIN SAYS FOREIGN PLOT FOILED In Bahrain , where the absolute Sunni Muslim monarchy has been grappling with a restive Shi'ite majority , said a foreign plot against the Gulf island state had been thwarted . The head of the Gulf Cooperation Council said interference in Gulf state affairs by Iran , the Shi'ite giant across the water from Bahrain , would not be tolerated . Confrontation between Bahraini Sunnis and Shi'ites calling for democracy has whipped up international tension in the region . About 1,000 Saudi soldiers and 500 police officers from the United Arab Emirates entered Bahrain last week to safeguard government facilities . Kuwaiti naval vessels arrived in Bahrain on Monday to help protect its waters as part of a Gulf defense pact , Bahrain 's state news agency said . Bahrain is the base for the U.S. Fifth Fleet , central to Washington 's military power in the oil-rich region . France became the first Western power on Monday to call publicly for Yemen 's Saleh to stand down . Pan-Arab TV channel Al Arabiya quoted Saleh as saying most Yemenis were with him and he would remain steadfast . A government official said the president had asked Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal to mediate in the crisis . Defense Minister Mohammad Nasser Ali said the army still backed Saleh , setting the stage for a possible standoff with those commanders who threw in their lot with tens of thousands of protesters who have taken to the street for weeks . The latest defections seemed to be sparked by Yemen 's bloody response to protests on Friday , when plainclothes snipers killed 52 protesters in Sanaa , prompting Saleh to sack his cabinet and declare a 30-day state of emergency . In Syria , hundreds of people demonstrated against the government in the southern town of Jassem , activists said , but authorities did not use force to quell the latest protest . `` This is peaceful , peaceful . God , Syria , freedom ! '' chanted the protesters in Jassem , an agricultural town near Deraa . Syrian Justice Minister Mohamad Ahmad Younis went to Deraa to try to calm emotions and open a dialogue with protesters . The authorities appeared to adopt less heavy-handed tactics , opting not to intervene against protests demanding freedom and an end to graft and repression , but not the overthrow of Assad . The Baath Party has banned opposition and enforced emergency laws since seizing power in a coup 48 years ago . The Pentagon said on Monday Libya air strikes had hamstrung Gaddafi 's might but signaled that the United States would keep the rebels at arm 's length to avoid getting mired in a messy civil conflict amid war weariness over Afghanistan and Iraq . General Carter Ham , U.S. commander leading a multinational coalition against Gaddafi , said three days of air and missile strikes had fashioned a broad no-fly zone but Western forces were not providing close air support for Libyan insurgents .

Credit : Reuters\\/Yemeni TV via Reuters TV By Cynthia Johnston and Mohamed Sudam SANAA | Tue Mar 22 , 2011 3:31 pm EDT SANAA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Yemen 's president said on Tuesday his country would descend into civil war if he were forced to quit and Washington voiced concern about instability in the Arab state that has become an al Qaeda stronghold . Seven weeks of unrelenting anti-government protests and defections among the ruling elite have piled pressure on Ali Abdullah Saleh , a U.S. ally against radical Islamist ambitions in the Arabian peninsula , to step down immediately after 32 years in power . But an aide said he would leave office only after organizing parliamentary polls and establishing democratic institutions , by January 2012 -- a declaration the opposition promptly rejected . `` Ali Abdullah Saleh does not seek power , '' Saleh 's media secretary Ahmed al-Sufi told Reuters . `` Ali Abdullah Saleh will not leave without knowing who he is handing over to . '' The United States , grappling with the diplomatic fallout of uprisings and uncertainty across the Arab world , voiced rare public alarm about the situation in Yemen . `` We are obviously concerned about the instability in Yemen , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said . His chief concern was to avoid `` diversion of attention '' from opposing al Qaeda there . Opposition spokesman Mohammed al-Sabry , rejecting Saleh 's offer to go by January 2012 , said the coming hours would be decisive . In speeches to army officers and tribal leaders in Sanaa , Saleh said Yemen faced a danger of civil war and disintegration because of efforts to stage a `` coup '' against his rule . `` You have an agenda to tear down the country , the country will be divided into three instead of two ... -LRB- parts -RRB- . A southern part , northern part and a middle part . This is what is being sought by defectors against ... unity , '' he said , referring to northern Shi'ite rebels and al Qaeda militants . `` Those who want to climb up to power through coups should know that this is out of the question . The homeland will not be stable , there will be a civil war , a bloody war . They should carefully consider this , '' Saleh told army commanders . Presidential guards loyal to Saleh surrounded an air force battalion in the coastal city of Hudaida after its commander said he supported the protesters . A presidential guard and a soldier died in clashes between the two forces in the southern coastal city of Mukalla late on Monday , medical sources said . In southern Abyan province , troops clashed with al Qaeda militants , killing 12 and wounding five , state media said . Liquefied natural gas producer Yemen LNG has told customers that unrest could lead to supply disruptions , leading stakeholder Total said . Western countries fear the political crisis could hasten a slide into failed nation status for a country that borders the world 's biggest oil exporter , Saudi Arabia , and major shipping routes . One scenario could see the country split into separate zones along tribal , military or regional lines . Al Qaeda has already used Yemen to attempt attacks in Saudi Arabia and the United States in the past two years . The Shi'ite Houthi movement has staged a number of revolts against Saleh . One opposition leader offered Saleh the prospect of secure retirement if , like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , he would go quietly , unlike Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . `` He should n't follow the style of Gaddafi by destroying the country and killing people , '' Yassin Noman , rotating head of Yemen 's opposition coalition said . `` After this long term of governing , he should say : Thank you my people , I leave you peacefully . '' `` I know the morality of Yemeni people . If he left peacefully , they will look at him as a real leader . He will be able to live wherever he likes , '' Noman told Reuters . `` They will ensure him a very nice life . His dignity will be kept . '' Several generals and officials have abandoned Saleh this week after a massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators on Friday On Tuesday , Abdel-Malik Mansour , Yemen 's envoy to the Arab League , told Al Arabiya television he was siding with protesters . Abdul-Rahman al-Iryani , whom Saleh sacked as environment minister on Sunday along with the rest of the cabinet , said on Facebook he was joining `` the revolutionaries . '' Defections have included generals , tribal leaders , diplomats and ministers . They have gained momentum since gunmen loyal to Saleh opened fire on demonstrators in the capital Sanaa on Friday . Fifty-two people were killed . A crowd of around 10,000 gathered outside Sanaa University in a rally that has been repeated for the past seven weeks , with youth playing a key role . Saleh offered dialogue with young people on Tuesday , and state media said he was sympathetic to their problems . Protesters , however , have been uncompromising . Echoing demands that have been satisfied in Tunisia and Egypt and continue to be heard elsewhere across the region , they chanted : `` The people want the fall of regime . '' The body of one of those killed on Friday was brought to the protesters before burial . `` The people want a trial for the butcher , '' they shouted , hurling abuse at Saleh . France on Monday became the first Western power to call publicly for Saleh to stand down . Foreign Minister Alain Juppe described his departure as `` unavoidable . '' Yemeni Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi returned from Riyadh on Monday where Saleh sent him to seek Saudi-led Gulf Arab mediation . A diplomatic source said there had been no indication of success in the effort to involve those countries . Tribal sources said tribal sheikhs had embarked on mediation efforts on Tuesday , focusing on a potential agreement that protests could continue , violence against protesters would be investigated and a smooth transition of power would take place . No more details were available . On Tuesday , soldiers were preventing cars driving along roads close to Saleh 's presidential palace in Sanaa . Late on Monday night residents heard explosions and shooting near a presidential place in Yemen 's eastern port of Mukalla . General Ali Mohsen , commander of the northwest military zone and Saleh 's kinsman from the al-Ahmar clan , said on Monday he was backing the protesters and warned of civil war . On Tuesday Mohsen -- seen by northern rebels as a ruthless military leader -- declared in a statement read out to the protesters camping out in Sanaa that the `` era of military coups is over '' and vowed to protect the `` youth revolution . '' Tanks were deployed outside the presidential palace in the southern port city of Aden , focal point of a separatist movement hoping to escape Yemen 's myriad problems by recreating the former South Yemen that feels cheated by unity under Saleh . Opponents complain that Yemen under Saleh has failed to meet the basic needs of the country 's 23 million people . Unemployment is around 35 percent and 50 percent for young people . Oil wealth is dwindling and water is running out . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . There are turmoil in Yemen , Bahrain and Libya . Why in the world would France , the US and etc. western countries only declaired a war to Libya ?! Well , we 're in the area , let 's just go to Yemen and bomb them .

Tell us about the political situation ! '' shouted the youth , before secret police arrested him and hurried him away . The scene at the mosque in the lower income Damascus district of Ruknaldin , recounted to Reuters by worshippers who witnessed it on Friday , was striking in a country where pliant citizens have endured government-dictated sermons for decades . In Damascus , as in the provinces , a barrier of fear which had blocked dissent is breaking down . Uprisings across the Arab world have not stopped at the door of one of its most hardline administrations . For the first time , placards other than those glorifying Syria 's ruling elite and the `` historic achievements '' of the Baath Party are being raised in the towns of the strategic Hauran plain south of Damascus . A single word is etched on them -- `` Freedom . '' The region , where four protesters have been killed by security forces since Friday , has seen the first non-sectarian protests against the Baath Party since Assad 's late father Hafez al-Assad crushed leftist and Islamist opponents in the 1980s . Among them were the cream of Syrian society -- lawyer and former judge Haitham al-Maleh , leftist leader Riad al-Turk , writer Akram al-Bunni , and poet Mohammad al-Maghout , who wrote that being tortured by a compatriot was more painful and humiliating than repression under French colonialism . The violent campaign by the Syrian authorities in the 1980s left up to 70,000 people missing . In 2004 , Kurds , many of whom are denied Syrian citizenship , mounted violent demonstrations against the government in which 30 people were killed . In a sign of changing times , Montaha al-Atrash , whose father led a revolt against French rule in the 1920s , addressed Assad directly in an interview on BBC Television . `` Dr Bashar , listen to us . Non-stop pressure and repression will generate an explosion . You know , and you see how the region is boiling , '' said Atrash , referring to a wave of Arab uprisings which have toppled two leaders and challenged many more . `` The regime is still responding to anyone calling for change by trying to portray it as a scheme for sectarian strife and division , and by unleashing on demonstrators security forces who are already filling the streets , '' she added , speaking in Syria . The protesters have not called for the removal of Assad , and Atrash said there was no hatred against the president , an ophthalmologist by training who was thrust into politics when his elder brother Bassel died in car accident in 1994 . But the name of one top figure of the ruling elite , Assad 's cousin Rami Makhlouf , is being uttered publicly . Owner of Syria 's largest cellphone company and several large businesses , Makhlouf is under U.S. sanctions for what Washington regards as public corruption . Until now , no one inside Syria has dared question his activities . The tycoon maintains his businesses are legitimate , providing professional employment for thousands of Syrians . `` Go away Makhlouf . We do n't want thieves ... There is no more fear after today , '' is one of the main chants of demonstrators who burned premises of Makhlouf 's Syriatel company . Residents of Deraa city , where the demonstrations started on Friday , say they have shaken off humiliation and decades of repression , and broken a ` fear factor ' that had made people suspicious that even close relatives might be informants . `` I can now smell freedom , '' said one youth , describing how mass demonstrations had helped unify a tribal-based society he said authorities had played a part in fracturing . Even if protests subside -- the south was calm on Tuesday morning -- Syrians say the grievances which sparked them remain . Opposition figure Riad al-Turk , who spent 25 years as a political prisoner including almost 18 years alone in a 2-meter by 2-meter underground cell during Hafez al-Assad 's rule , said Syrian leaders face `` the moment of truth . '' `` What is required is serious and clear steps to transform Syria from repression to democracy . `` They are steps outlined repeatedly : release political prisoners , abolish the state of emergency , legalize a multi-party system , separation of powers , the independence of the judiciary , and scrap the clause that makes the Baath Party ` leader of state and society ' , '' he said . `` All I know today is that Syria will not remain the kingdom of silence , '' 80-year-old Turk said . `` Fear will no longer suffocate , and my homeland will not remain a big prison .

At least four youths were killed when the security forces intercepted them at the northern entrance of Deraa , witnesses said . Their bodies were seen at a clinic in the city . There were unconfirmed reports that dozens more bodies were taken to Tafas hospital outside the city , they added . `` Bodies fell in the streets . We do not know how many died , '' one witness said . `` You did n't know where the bullets were coming from . No one could carry away any of the fallen , '' another resident said . The 10 people residents said were killed in the two attacks brought to 14 the number of civilians killed by Syrian forces in six days of demonstrations for political freedom and an end to corruption in the country of 20 million . Snipers wearing black masks were seen on rooftops . Parents were seen crying in the streets during the evening , and loudspeakers from mosques around Deraa called on those whose relatives had died to go to clinics to collect the bodies . `` Peaceful , peaceful , '' the loudspeakers echoed -- a cry taken up by protesters across the Arab world to emphasize the peaceful nature of their demonstrations against entrenched and undemocratic rulers and corruption , and their demands for freedom . Another witness saw 20 army trucks carrying soldiers heading to the city . Deraa , on the Jordanian border , has long been a stronghold of the ruling Baath Party , which recruits cadres from the region . But in recent days it has become a focus of unprecedented protests against President Bashar al-Assad 's rule . The shooting on Wednesday began just after midnight , when security forces attacked protesters in the vicinity of the Omari mosque in the city 's old quarter , the focal point of the Deraa protests , residents said . Electricity was cut off and telephone services were severed . Cries of `` Allahu Akbar -LRB- God is greatest -RRB- '' erupted in one quarter after another as the shooting at the mosque began . The bodies of two people killed in the mosque attack , a man and a woman called Ibtissam Masalmeh , where buried in Deraa on Wednesday . Thousands marched in the funeral chanting calls for freedom , and -- for the first time since protests broke on Friday -- slogans against Iran and Lebanon 's Hezbollah `` Honorable Syrians do n't rely on Iran or Hezbollah , '' they chanted , breaking a taboo of criticizing Syrian foreign policy , which is largely built on an alliance with the Shi'ite Islamic Republic and the armed Shi'ite movement . YouTube footage showed what was purported to be the street in front of the mosque before the attack , with the sound of gunfire audible and a person inside the mosque grounds yelling : `` Brother do n't shoot . This country is big enough for me and you . '' The United Nations , France and the United States condemned the violence . U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for a `` transparent investigation '' into the killings and for those responsible to be held accountable . `` We are deeply concerned by the Syrian government 's use of violence , intimidation and arbitrary arrests to hinder the ability of its people to freely exercise their universal rights , '' said U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner . `` We call on the Syrian government to exercise restraint and refrain from violence against these peaceful protesters . '' Those killed included Ali Ghassab al-Mahamid , a doctor from a prominent Deraa family who went to the Omari mosque to help victims of the attack . An official Syrian statement said : `` Outside parties are transmitting lies about the situation in Deraa , '' blaming what it described as armed gangs for the violence . It said they had `` stocked weapons and ammunition in the mosque and kidnapped children and used them as human shields . '' State television showed guns , grenades and ammunition it said were found in the mosque , but activists said the protest was peaceful and there had been no weapons . An official statement said later that Assad had sacked Deraa governor Faisal Kalthoum . But a main demand of the protesters is an end to what they term as repression by the secret police , headed in Deraa province by a cousin of Assad . The Baath Party has banned opposition and enforced emergency laws since 1963 . But the wave of Arab unrest which has toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt presents Assad with the biggest challenge to his rule since he succeeded his father Hafez al-Assad , who ruled Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000 . Assad , a close ally of Iran , a key player in neighboring Lebanon and supporter of militant groups opposed to Israel , has dismissed rising demands for fundamental reform in Syria where his Baath Party has held a monopoly on power for 48 years . Former colonial power France urged Damascus to carry out political reforms without delay and respect its commitment to human rights . On Tuesday , Vice President Farouq al-Shara said Assad was committed to `` continue the path of reform and modernization in Syria , '' Lebanon 's al-Manar television reported . Authorities arrested a leading campaigner who had supported the protesters , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday . It said Loay Hussein , a political prisoner from 1984 to 1991 , was taken from his home near Damascus . In Damascus , authorities released six female protesters on Wednesday who took part in a silent demonstration last week supporting the release of political prisoners , lawyers said . Assad has lifted some bans on private enterprise but ignored calls to end emergency law , curb a pervasive security apparatus , develop rule of law and freedom of expression , free political prisoners and reveal the fate of tens of thousands of dissidents who disappeared in the 1980s . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Only time will tell how this will end up like in Yemen , Bahrain , and Libya . I find it difficult to believe that some people in the Western countries can not see the obvious importance of supporting the democratic movement sweeping the Middle East . Even if we forget about humanitarian reasons , the vital economic and strategic interests of Western countries are highly rewarded in the support of democratic societies in that area : less hatred of the West , less radical authoritarian leaders , less terrorism -LRB- read less murders of civilians in the West -RRB- , more economic cooperation and reception of Western investment , more mutual trade , more stabilized oil market and more political stability in those countries . This is not the same `` war '' as the previous two . the Western countries are here being clamored for by the democratic insurgents , who will be grateful and willing economic and political partners of Western countries when they fully establish themselves in government . There are no Western or American flags being burnt by the insurgents this time round in the various Arab countries where insurgents are demanding democratic freedom and liberation from their barbaric , regressive and oppressive tyrants . It is no wonder that many autocratic Arab countries are hesitant to support the democratic movements in their other countries , since they feel like turkeys voting for Christmas . it is also not a surprise that China , Russia , Iran and Venezuela are adamant that the democratic movements in those countries should not be supported or protected by the Western countries . Of course we would all like to spend less on military activities and more on education and other socially necessary items within Western societies . But think : Should Britain have abstained from involvement in the Second World War against the Axis because it was already quite indebted and needed money for domestic programs ? Should the US not have gotten involved in the Second World War because it was costly ? Should the US not have spent enormous amounts of money during the Cold War to stop the spread of communism because of money being needed domestically ? Does the West really want to continue coexisting with all those tyrannical and retrograde regimes in the Arab countries that hate the West and surreptitiously foster terrorism against it ? If the West does nothing to help those insurgents , it will end up on the wrong side of history , much to its detriment on all fronts . The Arab World is falling apart . The Arab League must get together and send Troops into the Countries having problems and use deadly force if necessary to get things under control , then keep the peace . Understand I 'm not aagainst protesting , It must be allowed and the governments must stop using deadly force on peacefull protesters . This discussion is now closed .

Following are some comments on what may lie ahead for Syria . MAHA AZZAM , associate fellow at Chatham House `` Frictions will increase between the Assad regime and some in the army . But it is difficult to say what direction the army will take . `` It has been closely controlled by the regime and it has vested interests in the status quo . If it sees the Assad family as a liability , the army may feel it is in its interests to move against the regime . But I think you would need a greater momentum on the streets for that to happen . `` For now they 'll wait to see if the regime can bring reforms . My view is that the reforms would have to be drastic to be accepted by the people . `` What we 've seen in the other revolts in the region suggests that in Syria , even if the popular opposition is stemmed in coming weeks , it will resurface . Once you have broken the barrier of fear , it is probably a matter of when , not if , a regime falls . `` Stability in Syria is important for its neighbors including Israel and what 's happening is worrying for all of them , as well as for governments in the Gulf . '' FAYSAL ITANI , deputy head of Middle East and North Africa Forecasting at Exclusive Analysis `` The regime really does n't have any good options . It is placing enormous pressure on the mainly Sunni army by ordering it to fire on Sunni demonstrators . With the exception of the Alawi Republican Guard , the army is a Sunni conscript force . `` If the unrest continues at this pace the Syrian army is not going to be able to maintain cohesion . '' Asked if a repeat of the sort of wholesale massacre seen at Hama in the 1980s was possible , Itani replied : `` There is a very real risk of such a thing happening . For a minority regime this is an existential struggle . Minorities can not afford to let majorities take liberties . They do n't tend to see the middle ground . `` The question is not whether they are willing to do it . The question is whether they have enough troops willing to do it . '' KARIM EMILE BITAR , research fellow at the Paris-based Institute for International and Strategic Relations `` The Syrian regime will have to reform itself radically if it wants to survive . No country in the region is immune in the face of this revolutionary wind that is blowing from the Atlantic to the Gulf . `` The Syrian regime is attempting to make promises such as a potential lifting of the state of emergency , which has been in place since 1963 , a record in the Arab world . But if this happens it will be the end of a whole system , prisoners will have to be released , the press will be free ... when this kind of regime considers relaxing its grip , it also knows that everything could collapse . `` I think the army and the secret services will remain faithful to al-Assad right until the end , for reasons that are essentially sectarian -LRB- i.e. preservation of minority Allawite rule -RRB- . In Bahrain they played the Sunni-Shi ` ite card , in Syria we will see the Allawite-Sunni card . `` The specter of the -LRB- 1982 -RRB- Hama massacre is very present ... but now that there is YouTube , Facebook , Al Jazeera . It 's no longer so easy to crush dissent in this way . `` The international community does not have a lot of room for maneuver , but there are nonetheless lines that can not be crossed . `` Syria is Iran 's main ally in the Arab world . A fall of the regime would have consequences for Hezbollah and Hamas ... I 'm not sure that the region 's big powers would allow such a big shock .

Ferrari 's twice former world champion Fernando Alonso claimed a spot on the third row in fifth place next to Renault 's Vitaly Petrov , the best ever qualifying position for the Russian .

DERAA , Syria | Sat Mar 26 , 2011 11:08 pm GMT DERAA , Syria -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian security forces have killed six people in two days of anti-government protests in the key port city of Latakia , reformist activists living abroad told Reuters on Saturday . President Bashar al-Assad , facing his deepest crisis in 11 years in power after security forces fired on protesters on Friday in the southern town of Deraa , freed 260 prisoners in an apparent bid to placate a swelling protest movement . But the reports from Latakia , a security hub in the northwest , suggested unrest was still spreading . There were reports of more than 20 deaths in protests on Friday , mainly in the south , and medical officials say dozens have now been killed over the past week around Deraa alone . Such demonstrations would have been unthinkable a couple of months ago in this most tightly controlled of Arab countries . Bouthaina Shaaban , a senior adviser to Assad , told the official news agency that Syria was `` the target of a project to sow sectarian strife to compromise Syria and -LRB- its -RRB- unique coexistence model . '' Syrian rights activist Ammar Qurabi told Reuters in Cairo : `` There have been at least two killed -LRB- in Latakia -RRB- today after security forces opened fire on protesters trying to torch the Baath party building . '' `` I have been in touch with people in Syria since last night , using three cell phones and constantly sitting online . Events are moving at an extremely fast pace . '' Exiled dissident Maamoun al-Homsi told Reuters by telephone from Canada : `` I have the name of four martyrs who have fallen in Latakia yesterday . '' The state news agency quoted a government source as saying security forces had not fired at protesters but that an armed group had taken over rooftops and fired on citizens and security forces , killing five people since Friday . In Damascus and other cities , thousands of Assad 's supporters marched or and drove around , waving flags , to proclaim their allegiance to the Baath party . The unrest in Syria came to a head after police detained more than a dozen schoolchildren for scrawling graffiti inspired by pro-democracy protests across the Arab world . President Assad made a public pledge on Thursday to look into granting greater freedom and lifting emergency laws dating back to 1963 , but failed to dampen the protests . On Saturday a human rights lawyer said 260 prisoners , mostly Islamists , had been freed after serving at least three-quarters of their sentences . Amnesty International put the death toll in and around Deraa in the past week at 55 at least . In Sanamein , near Deraa , 20 protesters were shot dead on Friday , a resident told Al Jazeera . One unidentified doctor told CNN television that snipers had been shooting people in Deraa from atop government buildings . `` We had 30 people got shot in the head and the neck and we had hundreds of people got wounded , '' he said . `` We put two wounded in an ambulance sending them to the hospital . We had security forces stop the ambulances , get the wounded outside the ambulance and shoot them , and said : ` Now you can take them to the hospital ' . '' Some of the dead protesters were buried on Saturday in Deraa and nearby villages , residents said . Several thousand mourners prayed over the body of 13-year-old Seeta al-Akrad in Deraa 's Omari mosque , scene of an attack by security forces earlier in the week . Police were not in evidence when they marched to a cemetery chanting : `` The people want the downfall of the regime , '' a refrain heard in uprisings from Tunisia to Egypt and Yemen . Emboldened by the lack of security presence , the mourners also chanted : `` Strike , strike , until the regime falls ! '' Abu Jassem , a Deraa resident , said : `` We were under a lot of pressure from the oppressive authority , but now when you pass by -LRB- the security forces -RRB- , nobody utters a word . They do n't dare talk to the people . The people have no fear any more . '' In nearby Tafas , mourners in the funeral procession of Kamal Baradan , killed on Friday in Deraa , set fire to Baath party offices and the police station , residents said . There were also protests on Friday in Damascus and in Hama , a northern city where in 1982 the forces of president Hafez al-Assad , Bashar 's father , killed thousands of people and razed much of the old quarter to put down an armed uprising by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood . Syria 's establishment is dominated by members of the minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , a fact that causes resentment among the Sunni Muslims who make up some three-quarters of the population . Latakia is mostly Sunni Muslim but has significant numbers of Alawites . Edward Walker , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt , said sectarian friction made many in the establishment wary of giving ground to demands for political freedoms and economic reforms . `` They are a basically reviled minority , the Alawites , and if they lose power , if they succumb to popular revolution , they will be hanging from the lamp posts , '' he said . `` They have absolutely no incentive to back off . '' Asked if there could be a crackdown on the scale of Hama , Faysal Itani , deputy head of Middle East and North Africa Forecasting at Exclusive Analysis , said this was a `` real risk . '' `` For a minority regime this is an existential struggle , '' he said . `` If the unrest continues at this pace , the Syrian army is not going to be able to maintain cohesion . '' Many believed a tipping point had been reached . `` The Syrian regime is attempting to make promises such as a potential lifting of the state of emergency , which has been in place since 1963 , a record in the Arab world , '' Bitar said . `` But if this happens it will be the end of a whole system , prisoners will have to be released , the press will be free ... when this kind of regime considers relaxing its grip , it also knows that everything could collapse . '' Central Bank Governor Adeeb Mayaleh said the central bank was ready to supply the market with foreign currency liquidity , hinting at rising demand for U.S. dollars . Syria has a close alliance with Iran and links to the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas and the Lebanese Shi'ite political and military group Hezbollah . Its allies in the region have yet to comment on the unrest . `` Syria is Iran 's main ally in the Arab world . A fall of the regime would have consequences for Hezbollah and Hamas ... I 'm not sure that the region 's big powers would allow such a big shock , '' said Karim Emile Bitar , research fellow at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations in Paris .

Speaking in an interview taped on Saturday , Clinton said she deplored the violence in Syria but the circumstances were different in Libya , where Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had used his air force and heavy armor against civilians . Bordering Israel , Lebanon and Iraq and an ally to Iran , Syria has long had a vexed relationship with the United States , which accuses it of backing Palestinian militants , meddling in Lebanon and allowing anti-U.S. insurgents to cross into Iraq . The United States , which already has extensive sanctions on Syria , has few levers to influence Damascus and only restored an ambassador there in January after a nearly six-year gap . Syria , if it chose , could cause trouble for the United States in many ways , increasing its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon , providing greater backing to anti-Israel Palestinian groups such as Hamas or possibly moving against Israel itself , the United States ' closest ally in the Middle East . Asked if one should expect a U.S. involvement in Syria along the lines of the air strikes on Libya by the United States and other nations , Clinton flatly told CBS News ' `` Face the Nation '' program `` no. '' `` Each of these situations is unique , '' she added . `` We deplore the violence in Syria , we call as we have on all of these governments ... to be responding to their people 's needs , not to engage in violence , permit peaceful protests and begin a process of economic and political reform , '' she said . Analysts and a U.S. lawmaker said if the situation in Syria deteriorated , the United States may face calls for military action in a fourth Muslim country beyond Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya . Clinton said there was not the same level of violence in Syria and the government 's crackdown on protests had not yet garnered global condemnation or calls from the Arab League and others for a no-fly zone as there was with Libya . `` What 's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning , but there 's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities , than police actions which frankly have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see , '' she added . Senator Joseph Lieberman , an independent , suggested the United States and other countries could intervene militarily in Syria if President Bashar al-Assad , who came to power after the 2000 death of his father , Hafez , attacked protesters with greater ferocity . `` There 's a precedent now that the world community has said in Libya , and it 's the right one , ` we 're not going to stand by and allow this Assad to slaughter his people like his father did years ago , ' '' Lieberman told the `` Fox News Sunday '' program . Edward Walker , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt and Israel , said he would be reluctant to get involved militarily in Syria because the United States has so much on its plate , including winding down the war in Iraq and fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan . Asked if he could see the United States moving beyond its condemnation of the violence against protesters and its call for restraint by the Syrian authorities , Walker replied : `` No. . Not unless the situation gets considerably worse . `` If we start seeing a situation like existed in Hama , where you 've got a government waging war on its own population and the numbers -LRB- of deaths -RRB- are significantly larger , it 's going to put the administration in a terrible position , '' he said . If that happened , Walker said the Obama administration would face questions like `` why are we fooling around in Libya and not getting involved in Syria ? '' The Syrian authorities have a history of crushing dissent . In 1982 , Assad 's father sent in troops to put down a rebellion in the city of Hama , killing thousands .

Joe Lieberman , how many more Americans need to die for Israel ? Its beginning to look like the Conspiracy nuts who claimed this was a U.S. `` op '' were somewhat correct ; We dont say a word when Bahraini 's are attacked , not only by their own govt . . but by the armed forces of several other countries too . We say nothing whilst Yemen uses chemical weapons , landmines , and every other weapon they can think of to inflict mass casualties , which if\\/when turned into deaths amounts to genocide . Syria dares respond in a lighter manner than Bahrain\\/Yemen , and U.S. senators talk about intervention . Because we `` save '' Libya , and if this man had his way Syria too , it doesnt make us any less guilty or hypocritical in regard Bahrain\\/Saudi\\/Yemen . If we were truly only acting to `` save '' innocents\\/victims , we wouldve had a no fly zone above Yemen weeks before Gaddafi even considered his attacks .

The edition that had been sitting on a ledge in the pretty Anglican church in Wiltshire , central England for the past 150 years , barely touched and much less read , is one of only a handful that still exists . Although a sign above the book indicated it dated back to 1611 , it was only after the parochial church council -LRB- PCC -RRB- of St Laurence in Hilmarton decided to get it authenticated during the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible that they made their discovery . `` I noticed it like everyone who uses the church noticed it as an old Bible that was sort of there , but no one was sure about its origins until very recently , '' PCC member Chris Mastin-Lee told Reuters . St Laurence stopped using the Bible after the introduction of more modern versions , and fewer than 200 original printings of the 1611 King James version are believed to exist . Although the church , which has about 60 parishioners , is not expecting coach loads of tourists to suddenly turn up , Mastin-Lee said he would not be surprised to see an increase in numbers wanting to take a look . The St Laurence Bible , whose heavy handset Gothic script was printed on linen fabric , lacks any gold leaf or ornate illustrations , and was authenticated as a second edition because of a tell-tale misprint . A place in the Gospel of Matthew that should say Jesus entered the Garden of Gethsemane and spoke to his disciples instead says that Judas , who betrayed Jesus , entered the garden . The edition , which has suffered a bit of wear and tear over the years also has the first five chapters of Genesis missing . Other damage was caused when a former vicar , the Reverend Francis Fisher , had ornate hand-carved binding put on the book after discovering it in a church chest in 1857 . `` This is speculation but when he found it in the parish chest it 's likely that the edges of the pages would have been quite tatty , '' Mastin-Lee said . `` When he had the Bible bound we understand that it was the custom of Victorian binders to trim the pages to make them neat . '' But the Bible is priceless as an example of one of the first translations of the Gospels into English . `` Within 300 years , this translation transformed how English people spoke to each other , how we wrote our books and how we see our God , '' the King James Bible Trust says on its website . `` The translation of the Bible has had enormous consequences not just for England but America and this is still significant today . '' Some phrases in the King James Bible are still used today , such as `` a cross to bear , '' `` a broken heart '' and a `` law unto themselves . '' The church is looking to raise funds to put the Bible in a glass case , from which people would still be able to turn the pages and read it .

Some of the lucky 33,000 spectators who possess a ticket for the all-Asian final between India and co-hosts Sri Lanka headed straight to the Wankhede Stadium seven hours before the first ball is bowled to ensure they do not miss out on even one second of the day 's drama -- which could include Sachin Tendulkar scoring his 100th international century . In case the Indian team needed any reminders to what the country was expecting from them , they were greeted with newspaper headlines such as `` A nation holds its breath . '' Those who could not beg , borrow or steal a ticket to the ground , changed the batteries in their TV remote and set the day 's agenda around the contest . Even major hospitals in Mumbai installed large screens so that staff who want to follow the action do not call in sick . Mumbai has been transformed into a fortress with anti-aircraft guns placed at strategic locations , navy boats patrolling the coastline and elite security agencies completing the dragnet in the city which was targeted by militants in 2008 . The air-space above the stadium has been declared a no-fly zone and International Cricket Council president Sharad Pawar advised spectators to enter the stadium before the VIPs -- including presidents of both the nations -- start arriving . A group of seven friends was stuck in traffic for more than two hours after flying in from Delhi on Saturday morning , having shelled out 417,000 rupees $ 9,370 -LRB- 5,810 pounds -RRB- between them for their tickets which added up to a total face value of 35,000 rupees -LRB- $ 786.5 -RRB- . Fans were having to pass through multiple security posts and were allowed to take in their mobile phones , flags and banners . However , those carrying cameras , binoculars , radios and even bottles of water on a baking day in Mumbai were soon left frustrated as the items were confiscated due to safety measures . Similarly , smokers trying to sneak in cigarette packets failed to hoodwink the security personnel and could only watch on in disappointment as their loot was tossed into a bin . Journalists had to take their shoes off while entering the gates and were then frisked by guards to check if they had any banned items such as coins in their possession . The guards soon had a stash of seized coins piled high on their counters as no one could convince them that it impossible to throw anything on to the field from the enclosed press box area . Since only a fraction of India 's billion strong population could get entry into the Wankhede , pubs and bars around the city were trying to attract the masses by installing giant screens and promoting day-long ` happy hours ' . `` We have received heavy booking and in fact ca n't accommodate a single request anymore , '' Dinesh Naik , manager at a sports bar , told Reuters . The teams were greeted by huge roars as they entered the ground to warm-up for the contest and even Shane Warne flew into the city as he did not want to miss out on the carnival atmosphere . `` I 'm in Mumbai and the place is a real buzz -- ... Nice to be back in India -- love the people & passion , '' the retired Australian spinner wrote on his Twitter page . Warne , who had correctly predicted the India v England group-stage match would end in a tie , made another forecast . `` My prediction - very close contest and whoever bats first has a big advantage .

In many professions , a period as an intern can greatly increase an applicant 's chances of winning a permanent job . However , the government is concerned that such openings are often unadvertised and end up being offered to the children and friends of existing employees , restricting the diversity of the intake . `` For too long , internships have been the almost exclusive preserve of the sharp-elbowed and the well-connected , '' Clegg said as he launched the 11-month-old coalition 's social mobility strategy . `` Unfair , informal internships can rig the market in favor of those who already have opportunities . A country that is socially mobile bases opportunity on your ability and drive , not on who your father 's friends are , '' he added . The government has pledged to improve social mobility , which it says fell under the 13-year administration of Labor . As part of the strategy , the civil service will end the practice of informal internships by 2012 . Instead , all government department internships will be advertised on a central website .

A United Nations internal document seen by Reuters said Gbagbo had surrendered . A U.N. official , under condition of anonymity , said later that Gbagbo had not yet done so but had suggested he wanted to , and had requested U.N. protection . Gbagbo government spokesman Ahoua Don Mello , who was taking part in the negotiations , told Reuters by phone from Abidjan that the parties were still in talks . `` Some points are still being discussed . Nothing has been signed , Gbagbo has not signed anything , '' Don Mello said . The U.N. document said fighting in Abidjan and elsewhere in the country had stopped since midday local time , and that Ivory Coast 's generals had asked the U.N. peacekeeper force to protect pro-Gbagbo soldiers and take possession of all their weapons . France said it expected a swift exit by Gbagbo , who had clung to power since refusing to concede he lost last November 's presidential election to Alassane Ouattara , plunging the world 's top cocoa-growing nation into renewed civil war . `` We are on the brink of convincing him to leave power , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told parliament in Paris . Don Mello said the Gbagbo was negotiating the terms of his departure based on the recognition of Ouattara as president . The spokesman said the negotiations covered security guarantees for Gbagbo and his relatives . `` If everything goes well , we will have a declaration soon , '' Ahoua Don Mello told Reuters . Gbagbo was said to be in Abidjan , with some media reports saying he was in a bunker below his residence . Gbagbo 's forces called for a cease-fire after being comprehensively outgunned in the end , and French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said the West African country 's crisis could soon be over . `` We are in a situation where everything could be resolved in the next few hours , '' Longuet told a news conference . U.S. President Barack Obama called on Gbagbo to stand down immediately and order his fighters to lay down their arms . Over the past week , forces loyal to Ouattara had launched a major assault on Gbagbo 's last strongholds in Abidjan , driving home their campaign to oust him . A Reuters eyewitness reported on Tuesday that calm had returned to the district surrounding the presidential palace after days of fierce machinegun and heavy weapons fire . French tanks and several armored personnel vehicles were seen crossing Abidjan bridges formerly held by forces loyal to Gbagbo . The U.N. peacekeeping force in Ivory Coast , supported by the French military , had targeted Gbagbo 's heavy weapons capabilities on Monday with attack helicopters after civilians were killed in shelling . Attacks centred on military bases in the city , but also on rocket launchers `` very close '' to Gbagbo 's Cocody district residence , U.N. peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said on Monday . `` It looks like Gbagbo is trying to negotiate his way out . What he can offer is another matter ... his negotiating position is much weaker than a couple of weeks ago , '' said Hannah Koep , Ivory Coast analyst at London-based consultancy Control Risks . The conflict drove cocoa prices lower on Tuesday as dealers bet on a swift end to Gbagbo 's rule and a resumption of exports . The country 's defaulted $ 2.3 billion Eurobond rose as the assault raised expectations for repayment . In the north of Abidjan , bullet-riddled bodies lay by the side of the main motorway near the largely pro-Gbagbo neighborhood of Yopougon , evidence of recent fighting between Ouattara and Gbagbo forces , a Reuters witness said . An armored personnel carrier straddled the roadway , still in flames , and residents who had emerged from their houses to find water said they had heard machinegun and heavy weapons rounds through the night . The United Nations human rights office in Geneva expressed concern on Tuesday over the killings of dozens of civilians in Abidjan , amid reports of heavy weapons used in populated areas . Gbagbo had defied international pressure to give up the presidency after an election last November that U.N.-certified results showed Ouattara won , rejecting the results as fraudulent and accusing the United Nations of bias . More than 1,500 people are reported to have died in the standoff that has rekindled the country 's 2002-03 civil war , though the real toll is likely to be much higher . Several thousand pro-Ouattara fighters entered Abidjan from the north on Monday in a convoy of transporters , pick-ups mounted with machineguns and 4x4s loaded with fighters bearing AK-47 assault rifles and rocket launchers -- a `` final assault '' .

Unlike the armies in Tunisia and Egypt , whose refusal to confront non-violent demonstrations spelt the demise of their autocratic rulers , the fate of many senior Syrian military officers is closely tied to that of Assad . Although some officers from the Sunni Muslim majority have been promoted to senior ranks , Sunni influence has been weakened and Assad 's brother Maher controls key military units packed with Alawite soldiers . `` It will take an extraordinary amount of people power to defeat a regime this deeply entrenched . This is not Tunisia , '' said W. Andrew Terrill , research professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Army War college . `` The regime has been careful about placing Alawite loyalists in all key positions within the military so that the regime can defeat any effort to overthrow it . Some Sunni officers have risen to very high ranks but have very little power to command troops , '' Terrill said from Carlisle Barracks , Pennsylvania . The Assad family which has ruled Syria for 41 years comes from the Alawite mountains overlooking the Mediterranean , a stronghold of the secretive sect with links to Shi'ite Islam . Assad , who faces the greatest threat to his rule from more than two weeks of protests calling for an end to emergency law and one-party rule , has responded with a blend of force -- his security forces have killed dozens of protesters -- and vague promises of reform . Residents of Deraa , cradle of the Syrian protests , say Alawite forces commanded by Assad 's younger brother Maher have taken up positions around the southern city . Maher controls the Presidential Guard , the Republican Guard , and the Fourth Armoured Division -- key units that form the security backbone of the state together with the Alawite-dominated secret police . `` Some observers consider Maher al-Assad to be excessively violent and emotionally volatile . It appears that President Assad views his brother as totally trustworthy , '' said Terrill , a specialist in Syrian military affairs . Although family ties ensure the loyalty of the top brass , Assad can not antagonize the army rank-and-file with a repeat of the 1982 crackdown on the city of Hama , when his father Hafez al-Assad sent commandos , paratroopers and Baath Party irregulars to put down an armed uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood . Hafez al-Assad 's brother Rifaat personally managed the Hama operation , in which tens of thousands were killed and parts of the city flattened . `` Syria 2011 is not Syria 1982 . You have hundreds of thousands of soldiers -- conscripts and professional soldiers -- who have seen only corruption and abuse of position by their Alawite commanders , '' said a former Syrian army member . `` It will be very dangerous for Bashar to play this game . `` The army will not ask Bashar to step down , as was the case in Egypt and Tunisia , but he can not easily ask the army to commit massacres either , '' the ex-soldier said . Assad would also be hesitant to use Maher 's Republican Guard to quell protest because it would increase resentment against Alawites , he said . . Another military expert working for a Western government said the Syrian army would fracture if the Alawite ruling hierarchy attempted a repeat of the Hama massacre , but the president could get away with smaller scale killings . `` It would also depend on how the killings are presented . There is a difference between shooting peaceful protesters and killing demonstrators who attack security forces , '' he said . Although Deraa residents say Maher al-Assad 's units are positioned around the city , Alawite secret police and special police units have deployed to confront demonstrators . More than 40 protesters have been killed in the clashes , witnesses said . Terrill said Alawite units would have no qualms suppressing dissent because they have been indoctrinated to believe their community would lose out if majority Sunnis attain power . `` It can be safely assumed that virtually all of the Alawites within the military will fight to defend the regime . '' Asked if Sunni soldiers could revolt if they saw more of their co-religionists killed , Terrill said : `` Syria 's security organs will move quickly and ruthlessly to suppress even the germs of revolt within the military .

Syrian security forces killed 17 pro-democracy demonstrators and two were shot dead in Yemen . In Saudi Arabia local Shi'ites protested in the oil-producing east to call for the withdrawal of Saudi troops from neighbouring Bahrain . In Cairo 's Tahrir Square , perhaps the spiritual home of the Arab protest movement , crowds demanded Mubarak 's prosecution as discontent with military rule grows ; but in Oman heavy security prevented a planned demonstration after Friday prayers . Friday has become a peak day of protest for many Arabs since popular demands for freedom , democracy and an end to corruption began in Tunisia late last year and spread across the region . In Syria , security forces opened fire on thousands of demonstrators in the southern city of Deraa as protests against President Bashar al-Assad flared in several towns . A hospital source and an activist reported 17 dead in Deraa , where protests began last month before spreading across the country . `` There were snipers on roofs . The injured are being taken to homes . No one trusts putting his relative in a hospital in these circumstances , '' said a witness , who spoke to Reuters by telephone . Authorities have blamed armed groups for the violence , and state television broadcast footage of masked gunmen in plain clothes it said fired at security forces and civilians alike . It said a policeman and an ambulance driver were killed . Syria has prevented other media reporting from Deraa . In eastern Syria , ethnic Kurds demonstrated for reform despite Assad 's offer this week to ease rules which bar many of them from obtaining citizenship , activists said . Violence also broke out in Yemen as crowds demanded the overthrow of President Ali Abdullah Saleh . Two people were shot dead and 25 wounded by gunfire in the southern city of Taiz , hospital sources said . But Saleh rejected any aspect of a Gulf Arab mediation plan for talks with the opposition that would aim to end his 32-year rule . `` The Yemeni people are free to accept mediation from their brothers and friends , but they reject taking orders or intervention , '' Saleh said in a statement . Elsewhere , the day of protest was more peaceful . Tens of thousands of Egyptians in Tahrir Square demanded Mubarak 's prosecution and accused the military of being too slow to root out corruption from his era . `` Oh , Field Marshal , we 've been very patient ! '' chanted some of the demonstrators in the square , hub of the movement that toppled Mubarak on February 11 and left the army in charge , led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi . Friday 's protest had swollen by early afternoon to at least 100,000 , indicating growing frustration with the army which has enjoyed broad support since it took control of the country . `` It 's a strong message that the revolution is not over yet and is still going on and will not quieten down before its goals are realized , '' said Hassan Nafaa , a professor of political science and a prominent figure in the reform movement . Hundreds of Saudi Shi'ites also peacefully demanded that Saudi troops return from Bahrain , and called for political rights and freedoms at home , demonstrators said . The protests -- with riot police nowhere to be seen -- were held in the main Shi'ite Muslim center of Qatif , where demonstrators , some of them women , waved Bahraini as well as Saudi flags , and the nearby village of Awamiya . Banners read `` respect the rights to demonstrate '' and `` freedom of expression and opinion . '' Saudi Arabia sent 1,000 troops last month to Bahrain , a Sunni Muslim monarchy , to help contain pro-democracy protests led by that Gulf Arab country 's Shi'ite majority . Heavy security prevented demonstrations after Friday prayers in the Omani city of Sohar , where protesters camped out for over a month before forces moved them out last week . Checkpoints were set up across the city with dozens of armored vehicles blocking access to protest areas . Residents ' names were checked against a list and access to mosques was restricted , while a helicopter flew overhead , witnesses said . -LRB- Reporting by Mohamed Sudam , Erika Solomon , Khaled al-Mahdital , Nick Macfie , Saleh Al-Shaibany , Mariam Karouny , Yara Bayoumy , Khaled Yacoub Oweis , Jason Benham and Suleiman al-Khalidi ; writing by David Stamp ; editing by Ralph Boulton -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "195", "dct": "2011-04-08", "dates": ["2011-04-08", "2011-04-08", "2011-04-08", "2010-01-01", "2012-03-11", "2011-07-01", "2011-09-01", "2011-03-01", "2011-04-08", "1974-01-01", "2011-04-08", "2011-04-08"], "text": "TOKYO | Fri Apr 8 , 2011 1:30 pm BST TOKYO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Japan announced power reduction targets for Tokyo and north Japan that will require big manufacturers and other large-scale users to cut peak summer consumption by one-fourth as it vowed to avoid rolling blackouts that could hobble the economy . The trade ministry also called for 20 percent power cuts by small-scale industrial power users served by quake-hit Tokyo Electric Power and Tohoku Electric Power , while household cuts were set at 15 to 20 percent , in draft proposals released on Friday . The government estimates that , with a particularly hot summer like last year 's , peak power production could fall short of demand by as much as 18,300 MW in the two utilities ' service area -- or about one-fourth of total demand -- after a massive March 11 quake and tsunami shut down several big nuclear and thermal power stations . With the reductions , to be implemented from July to September , the Tokyo area and northern Japan would in principle be able to avoid rolling blackouts , Trade Minister Banri Kaieda told a news conference , although that option would be held in reserve as a last resort to forestall an unexpected blackout for the entire service area if demand threatens to surpass supply . Tokyo Electric imposed rolling blackouts last month after the quake , which took out 23 percent of its generating capacity . The blackouts dealt a severe blow to activity in a region that generates 40 percent of GDP in the world 's third-largest economy . `` This curb in power demand must not lead to damage to Japan 's economic activity , '' Kaieda said . `` I hope firms in western Japan would boost their economic activity so that Japan 's economy as a whole will not shrink . '' Companies may also shift some of their output abroad to meet the targets , said Shigeru Suehiro , senior economist at the Institution of Energy Economics , Japan . Tokyo Electric , still struggling with a prolonged safety crisis at its Fukushima nuclear complex , said on Friday that it would be able to meet power demand for the next two months , although just barely . The ministry 's proposal requires big manufacturers to submit power-saving plans , such as adjustments to operating hours , and would subject them to modest penalties of 1 million yen -LRB- 7,164 pounds -RRB- if they fail to reach the targets . They could also be publicly identified as not meeting government requirements . The proposals , due to be finalized by the end of the month and Japan 's first government-imposed power curbs since the 1974 oil crisis , would require the reductions on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. , when air-conditioning use would be heaviest . Kaieda said the government was not considering raising electricity rates to curb demand . -LRB- Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori ; Editing by Edmund Klamann -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "212", "dct": "2011-04-08", "dates": [null, null], "text": "A man looks at an electronic board at a brokerage house in Shanghai April 6 , 2011 .

The opinions expressed are her own . LONDON -- Syria 's crackdown will stamp on its economic dream . Bashar al-Assad 's regime had an ambitious plan to quadruple foreign investment and boost tourism in order to drive growth in a poor country with dwindling oil . But the violent suppression of protestors will scare off both investors and tourists . When George W. Bush was U.S. president , Syria was brought into an expanded `` axis of evil '' , which included countries like Iran . But until last month , Assad was having some success in normalising relations with the West . The United States recently appointed its first ambassador to the country in years . Assad jetted around Western capitals , portraying Syria as on the path to modernisation . There was even a glossy profile earlier this year of his photogenic wife in American Vogue . Against that backdrop , Syria 's plans to improve infrastructure by attracting foreign direct investment worth $ 55 billion by 2015 -- roughly equivalent to its entire annual GDP -- looked plausible , even though current FDI is around just $ 2.5 billion a year . The same was true of Syria 's five-year goal to capitalize on its rich history by boosting tourism a further 40 percent to reach over 12 million visitors a year . Indeed , tourist numbers were up 40 percent last year alone . This would have helped Syria achieve its growth target of 5 percent to 6 percent a year over the next five years . While that 's not much faster than in previous years , it would have offset the steady decline in oil related revenues , currently around 5 percent of GDP , and problems in agriculture -- an even bigger pillar of the economy which , in a good year , accounts for as much as one quarter of GDP . But the escalating violence in Syria has left the country 's economic plans looking more like a fantasy . While over 70 percent of visitors to Syria come from the Arab region -- a chunk of tourism that may not be so easily frightened away -- it was from Europe that Syria hoped to attract the bulk of new big-spending tourists . Equally , it was from the West that Syria aimed to bring in new investment . Every bullet fired makes that less likely . Just goes to show that you can not hope to develop and sustain a open economy without the inevitable social revolution . Whats going on in Syria is ahead of the game and hopefully in the long run it will benefit the people there . Also , How will Israel and Lebanon respond to any new form of government in Syria ? I could see freedom fighters streaming into Syria and an itchy Israel fearing that any new state may take on a more extremist position . We have to remember that Syria 's borders are just lines on a map . I 'm hoping for a more peaceful outcome , but that is very unlikely because the west let Egypt 's Mubarak go to jail when he should have been rewarded for letting democracy win . There is no incentive for any other abusive dictators to step down voluntarily . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Much of their season has been characterised by a knack of grinding out results without playing particularly well but the performance over both legs of a 3-1 aggregate victory against the London side was all about style and class . Manager Alex Ferguson has been quick to point out that this season is very different to 1999 because of the injuries they have suffered but his players have recovered just in time for the run-in and returned with a new spark . `` I think we 've hit our form , '' said Ferguson after Tuesday 's 2-1 victory at Old Trafford . `` I do n't think there 's any doubt about that . You 've seen it in the second half at West Ham -LRB- a 4-2 win after being 2-0 down at halftime -RRB- and the -LRB- first leg -RRB- performance at Chelsea , plus the performance tonight . '' The Scot has said the return of key players such as center back Rio Ferdinand has been like signing new players but with the added bonus that they already know how to play for the club . Ferdinand , who started limping early in Tuesday 's 2-1 win at old trafford but battled on , was just one of several key figures who were outstanding in a team whose cohesion is growing . Mexico striker Javier Hernandez , goal-poacher in chief , has been a revelation and his knack of netting at key moments has kept top scorer Dimitar Berbatov on the bench . Wayne Rooney has gelled better with Hernandez than Berbatov and seems to be revelling in a deeper position behind the Mexican that is proving very effective . `` He -LRB- Rooney -RRB- is enjoying the position he 's playing in at the moment because it has given him a lot of freedom to use his energy , in that position you do need energy , '' Ferguson told a news conference after Tuesday 's victory . In the first leg Rooney was given too much space and scored the only goal of the game , and while Chelsea changed their shape to try to restrict him in the return leg he still pulled the strings and used his eye for a long ball to devastating effect . Similarly effective has been the evergreen Ryan Giggs , who was involved in all three of his team 's goals in the tie , a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact he is now 37 . Giggs knows what it feels like to win the treble and that could be key as United seek success in the Champions League , Premier League and FA Cup . `` His experience and composure are vital , '' Ferguson said of the Welshman . `` He 's just a unique person and player . `` He 's lucky , in the sense he 's got a physique that does n't carry any weight , he 's got fantastic balance ... He looks after himself . To play at 37 years of age there must be tremendous sacrifice to do that . '' Ferguson was heading to Germany on Wednesday to find out who his team will face in the Champions League last four , although it is likely to be Schalke 04 who lead holders Inter Milan 5-2 from the first leg at the San Siro . If United win the semi-final , a trip to Wembley for the final would beckon and they will have an early chance to get a feel for the turf this Saturday when they face lcoal rivals Manchester City in their FA Cup semi-final .

Hamas , which runs the enclave , espouses an Islamist agenda focussed on the Palestinian nationalist conflict with Israel . So , unlike Islamists in Iraq , Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia who have kidnapped and killed Westerners , Hamas 's leadership has sought to build support and sympathy for its cause in the West . A British journalist kidnapped by a fringe Islamist group in Gaza four years ago was released unharmed days after Hamas won a brief civil war and took control . An Israeli soldier captured by Hamas and its Palestinian allies during a border raid in 2006 is still believed to be alive in captivity . There is genuine outrage here over the cold-blooded killing of Vittorio Arrigoni , an Italian activist who lived in the enclave for two years helping Gaza fishermen deal with Israel 's tight maritime blockade . `` I was about to cry when I heard the news . That man quit his family for us , for Gaza , and now Gazans killed him . That was so bad , '' said supermarket owner Abu Ahmed . Samira Ali , a teacher , said : `` Those who killed him are not Muslims and certainly not Palestinians . '' Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum denounced the crime as an attempt `` to harm international solidarity with besieged Gaza and to damage the image of the Palestinian people . '' But there was also a shiver of fear that extremists who want Gaza to be an Islamic theocracy are bold enough to challenge Hamas over what they consider its lack of religious fervor . Friends and fellow pro-Palestinian activists said Arrigoni , a blogger , was well known in Gaza and well liked . His captors , calling themselves Jihadist Salafi , saw him as an infidel who `` entered our land only to spread corruption . '' They seized the 36-year-old to force Hamas to release their leader , Hesham al-Sa ` eedni , who was arrested last month and identified by Gaza sources as an Egyptian senior member of the Tawheed and Jihad group linked to al Qaeda . This group denied responsibility , but observers said the message of the kidnappers bore all the hallmarks of the Jihadist Salafi and could be an autonomous cell of this movement . `` They knew Hamas was not going to agree to their demands and so they killed him in order to send a message , '' said political analyst Hani Habib . `` It is a sign of doubts over the security situation in Gaza and whether it is stable as Hamas says . '' Hamas security forces arrested two men and were seeking others suspected of involvement , as senior figures in the movement scrambled to condemn an `` ugly crime '' totally alien to their beliefs and insist that Hamas 's grip remains intact . Hamas , which has run the enclave since 2007 , said Arrigoni 's abductors `` had the intention to kill the Italian from the beginning , and the proof was that they had killed him hours after the announcement of their demands . '' Interrogation of one of the group disclosed the location where he was being held , but he was already dead . Habib believes radical splinter groups ready to defy Hamas are now competing to demonstrate who is the more extreme . Hamas itself is an Islamist political movement which places religion at the center of its mission to end Israeli occupation of Palestinian land . Hamas was founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood . An Israeli security official , who did not wish to be named , said : `` We 've been watching these kind of challenges to Hamas for a while . The obvious relevance to us is the question of whether Hamas is still in charge . '' But for Israel , Hamas was still answerable for any violence from Gaza , and recent fighting in which at least 36 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in response to rocket fire `` made clear that it was in Hamas 's interest to assert order . '' There are half a dozen radical Islamist groups in Gaza with membership numbering in the hundreds . The differences between them are unclear . Some analysts believe they work in cells to evade Hamas pressure . All want to end Western influence and establish an Islamic state across the Middle East . Hamas wants a Palestinian state , albeit an Islamic one . It has largely refrained from imposing Islamic law since taking control of Gaza in 2007 and has also condemned al Qaeda attacks in Western cities . Hamas , with some 25,000 men under arms , has said its more radical rivals are simply misguided offered them `` re-education . '' Palestinian analyst Hani Masri said it was premature to say Hamas has lost control of Gaza . `` Such incidents can happen anywhere , '' he said . But this would have an impact on Hamas . `` If Hamas is trying to show an image of moderation and could not get something in return from the international community , this will leave a vacuum for more radical groups , even within Hamas itself , '' Masri said . George Giacaman , political analyst at Birzeit University in the West Bank , saw Arrigoni 's murder as `` a tremendous challenge for the authority of Hamas ... a huge embarrassment for them . '' The movement , armed by Iran and shunned as a terrorist organization by the West , is trying `` to make their authority in Gaza acceptable for the Arabs and foreign countries , '' he said . It had succeeded to a certain extent in stopping the firing of rockets and mortars into Israel over the past two years , and it would now be most intent on restoring control with rigor . But there were risks attached to that course , he said . Hamas forces in August 2009 killed 28 people , mostly Salafis , in the storming of a mosque where a radical cleric who supported al Qaeda surrounded himself with armed men and declared an Islamic emirate . `` They can not do that every day , '' Giacaman said .

Vinci lost 6-4 6-2 to Vera Zvonareva as Russia powered to their first Fed Cup final in three years with a 5-0 drubbing while in the other semi-final Czech Republic beat Belgium 3-2 thanks to a last rubber win in the doubles . `` If they did n't want to come it 's their problem , '' world number 37 Vinci told a news conference when asked about the withdrawals of world number four Schiavone and 20th ranked Pennetta , their two leading players . `` I do n't care about Schiavone and Pennetta , they are not on this team . Right now I 'm number one for Italy and Sara -LRB- Errani -RRB- is number two . We 're here and we try to give our best . '' Schiavone skipped the semi-final tie to concentrate on the defense of her French Open title while Pennetta was ruled out with a shoulder injury , leaving the three-times champions with only a slim chance . The Russians , with world number three Zvonareva and former U.S. and French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova leading the charge , had been the overwhelming favorites . Russia , who won the women 's team competition four times between 2004 and 2008 , will host the Czechs in November . Zvonareva had little sympathy for the holders and after crushing Errani 6-0 6-2 in Saturday 's opener was just as dominant on Sunday . She broke Vinci in the ninth game for a 5-4 lead before serving out the first set then going on to seal a comfortable victory after 74 minutes . `` It was a very emotional win for me , '' Zvonareva said . `` I knew it would give my team an unassailable 3-0 lead and put us in the final . So maybe that 's why I was a bit more nervous and probably made a few more mistakes than yesterday . '' Cheered on by a sparse home crowd , Zvonareva was never really troubled by Vinci but paid tribute to her opponent . `` Roberta is a tough opponent and she just would n't give it to me without a fight . But after she went ahead 4-3 in the first set , I was able to raise my game and played smart tennis . '' Vinci agreed with her opponent , saying : `` Yes , that was probably the turning point in the match . She led 3-1 , then it was 4-3 for me but after that she just played very very well . `` I tried to do my best but it was not good enough to win the match , '' added the Italian , who also lost 6-2 6-7 6-1 to Kuznetsova in Saturday 's singles . Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova , replacing Kuznetsova for the last singles , edged out Errani 7-6 7-6 before teaming up with Ekaterina Makarova to beat Alberta Brianti and Maria-Elena Camerin 7-6 6-1 and complete the whitewash . The Czechs , in their first final since they won the title in 1988 as Czechoslovakia having lost in the semi-finals the last two years , had doubles pair Iveta Benesova and Barbora Zahlavova Strycova to thank for a 6-4 6-4 final rubber victory . Their opponents Kirsten Flipkens , who beat Zahlavova Strycova earlier on Sunday to put the tie in the balance at 2-2 , and Yanina Wickmayer who lost to Petra Kvitova in the day 's opener , were broken late in both sets to concede the tie .

A Scot from Glasgow who joined Reuters in 1952 , he drove over 500 miles -LRB- 800 km -RRB- in fog on crumbling roads from Warsaw to Budapest in October 1956 to be on the spot to break the news when the Soviet Army put down Hungary 's anti-communist uprising . Over several days he dodged bullets amid fierce fighting on the streets , filing stories with the help of a trio of women who worked as telephonists in his hotel and once from an ancient telex machine in a rebel command post . Forced to take refuge in the British embassy when the Soviet command imposed a 24-hour curfew , he still managed to stay on in Budapest until January 1957 , becoming one of the last Western reporters to leave when the new authorities ordered him out . A trooper in the British Army during World War Two , Farquhar survived the destruction of his tank by a German shell in Tunisia , suffering serious facial burns . When he joined Reuters after six years with local newspapers in Scotland and England , the burns effectively decided his career path after a doctor decreed that he should not expose his face to strong sun and must never have a tropical posting . A German-speaker , he was first sent to Frankfurt and then in 1955 to Czechoslovakia where he met his future wife Vera , an editorial assistant in the Reuters office in Prague . Like many Cold War romances between Westerners and East Europeans at the time , theirs ran foul of the communist bureaucracy . They were not allowed to marry and Vera was refused an exit visa when he was transferred to Warsaw in 1956 . For five years they carried on a long-distance relationship , including during the two years he was in Beijing from 1958-60 . Finally , the Czechoslovak authorities relented and they were married in Prague in 1960 . In Beijing , he reported on the gradual estrangement between Communist China and the Soviet Union and the flaring of a border dispute with India . `` It was a great place to be at the time , totally different to anything else I had known , '' he once said . After Beijing , now with Vera , he went to Belgrade for four years , tracking not only Marshal Josip Broz Tito 's improving relationship with Moscow but also the decline of the `` liberal '' Yugoslav version of communism . Over the following years he was in Geneva , specialising in disarmament issues , again in Warsaw and the West German capital Bonn and then back to Geneva from 1973 to 1980 . His last posting before retiring in 1983 was to Vienna where he followed the decline of the Soviet empire and the economies of the Eastern European countries , training many young Reuters journalists whom he infected with his love for the region . He and Vera , who died in 2008 , settled in Geneva , and he worked part-time for Reuters until 1992 .

Yet the unrest , which rights groups say has cost more than 200 lives , including 17 on Monday , shows no sign of abating . Assad and his father before him have ruled Syria under a tough emergency law in force since 1963 , bolstered by the Baath party , the military and an array of fearsome security agencies . While the Syrians demanding freedom seem far from dislodging Assad , no Arab ruler can feel secure in a region electrified by the swift fall of autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia this year . The Assads , whose country sits on the fault lines of many Middle Eastern conflicts , have pursued relatively predictable external policies . Any political change in Syria would be a big deal for its friends and foes alike in a volatile region . Following are some scenarios of what could happen in Syria and the risks and opportunities they would present : \\* ASSAD KEEPS POWER , ENACTS REFORM Conceivably , the Syrian president may decide to bend with the wind and implement far-reaching reform . Last week he promised to replace emergency law and appointed a new cabinet . But protesters will want proof the 45-year-old leader can make a real break with the past . Previously he has resisted political reform . His attempts to modernize a socialist-style economy have failed to create enough jobs or alleviate hardship . Assad 's problem is that dismantling the apparatus of repression , enshrining the rule of law to defeat corruption or allowing new parties to challenge his Baath party would remove the props of his power with no guarantees of political survival . Such a high-risk course could regain popular support for Assad , but he would have to undermine his own entourage and ditch the authoritarian template used since his formidable father Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970 . \\* PROTEST MOVEMENT IS CRUSHED Nearly 30 years ago , the elder Assad ruthlessly put down an armed Islamist uprising , killing thousands of people in the city of Hama in military operations cloaked from international view . That degree of violence would be harder to get away with today , when Syrians , despite state curbs on media , can use their mobile phone cameras to post footage of protests on YouTube . Nevertheless , the Interior Ministry now says Syria is facing an armed insurrection by Salafi Muslims . Security forces led by Assad relatives and allies have shown few qualms in detaining dissidents or using batons , bullets and tear gas on protesters . Hanging tough seems the likeliest default option for an embattled Assad as he seeks to rally support from his own minority Alawite community , sections of the Sunni majority and many other Syrians with a stake in the status quo . \\* ASSAD QUITS OR IS OVERTHROWN Barely thinkable just a few weeks ago , regime change remains a long shot , although the persistence of protests despite bloody crackdowns has shortened the odds that Assad might buckle . What might come next -- a peaceful transition of power , a military coup , prolonged instability or civil war -- is anyone 's guess . The 2003 removal of Saddam Hussein , the Arab world 's only other Baathist ruler , plunged Iraq into years of violent chaos . Sunni-majority Syria , dominated under the Baathists by its 10 percent Alawite minority , has other ethnic-sectarian divides , with restive Kurds as well as Druze and Christian communities . Anti-Assad demonstrators have stressed national unity rather than narrower identities -- and many have called only for reform rather than regime change . But if Baathist rule collapsed , Syria would enter the unknown and long-hidden strains could surface . Under any scenario , Syria is likely to be preoccupied with its internal problems for many months , reducing the chances that it will undertake any major initiative such as resuming peace negotiations with Israel over the occupied Golan Heights . The impact of any regime change would reverberate across the Arab world and Iran . Syria , still formally at war with Israel , also has borders with Lebanon , Turkey , Iraq and Jordan . Israel might be sorry if Assad fell . Although he has helped arm Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and harbored Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , he has maintained the calm prevailing on the Israeli-Syrian border since the 1973 war . Turmoil in Syria might see the pragmatic Baathists dislodged by Islamist or nationalist groups more hostile to Israel . The United States , its hands full in Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya , said on Monday it was not working to undermine the Syrian government -- although the Washington Post , citing leaked U.S. diplomatic cables , said Syrian exiles and other dissidents had received up to $ 6 million in U.S. funds since 2006 . For all Syria 's opposition to U.S. and Israeli policies in the Middle East , it has played a cautious hand , balancing its Arab nationalist ideology and links with Iran against its desire for acceptance in the West and ultimately peace with Israel . On the other hand , Washington would see advantages in a new Sunni leadership in Damascus that might end Syria 's three-decade alliance with Shi'ite Iran and support for Hezbollah , in favor of closer ties with Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab powers . That would reshape the political landscape in Lebanon , where Hezbollah and its Shi'ite and Christian allies now hold the upper hand over their U.S.-backed Sunni and Christian opponents . Any downgrading of Iran 's alliance with Syria , its main conduit for aid to Hezbollah and Hamas , would damage Tehran 's ability to project its influence in the Middle East . Iraq , a former Baathist rival of Syria and still on uneasy terms , would also feel the ripples from any upheaval in Damascus , which has played an often ambivalent role in its eastern neighbor since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 . Most combustible for Lebanon , Iraq and the region would be sectarian or ethnic conflict in Syria , should it lose its secular Baathist straitjacket , fuelling tensions elsewhere between Sunnis and Shi'ites , Arabs and Kurds , or Christians and Muslims .

Satisfaction with the government has also improved slightly , although overall support for the Liberal Democrats has dropped to single figures . A year ago , more than 30 percent of people said they would vote for the Lib Dems , their pre-election peak , and just over 20 percent actually did so on election day in May . Now just nine percent of those who plan to vote would now choose the party , the April Reuters\\/Ipsos MORI political monitor shows . The Lib Dem 's popularity has plunged since they entered into the coalition and dropped many of their flagship policies , notably free university education . `` The Liberal Democrats are struggling to maintain voters ' support and the party is suffering from perceptions that the coalition is divided , '' Ipsos MORI 's Helen Cleary said . `` It is seen as dominated by its coalition partners , with two-thirds of the public believing that the Conservatives are making most of the decisions in the government . '' The Conservatives and Labor are neck and neck in support at 40 percent , a rise of three percentage points for the Conservatives compared to last month . That coincided with a rise in satisfaction with the government to 37 percent , its highest level so far this year , though 55 percent remain dissatisfied . Economic optimism has also improved in the wake of official figures showing surprise drops in both unemployment and inflation . Three in 10 of those surveyed think the economy will improve over the next 12 months , the highest level of optimism about Britain 's short term economic future since last July . Two-fifths -LRB- 42 percent -RRB- think that the situation will get worse over the next 12 months , although this is the first month of 2011 in which less than half have been pessimistic about Britain 's economic situation . The public remain sceptical that a coalition government is good for Britain , which could spell trouble for those hoping to sway voters in a referendum on voting reform on May 5 , the anniversary of last year 's general election . Liberal Democrats , and some Labor politicians , want to see a change that opponents , including the Conservatives , argue would make coalition government more likely . Coalition government is extremely rare in the UK . The Reuters\\/Ipsos MORI poll showed most people believe it is a bad thing for the country that no party achieved an overall majority at last year 's general election -LRB- 58 percent -RRB- , an increase since last May -LRB- 52 percent -RRB- .

The prayers will test whether President Bashar al-Assad 's decision Thursday to lift emergency law , imposed by his Baath Party when it took power in a coup 48 years ago , will defuse mass discontent with repression and corruption . Aided by his family and a pervasive security apparatus , Assad , 45 , has absolute power in Syria . More than 220 protesters have been killed since pro- democracy protests erupted on March 18 in the southern city of Deraa , including 21 protesters killed this week in Homs , rights campaigners say . A decree Assad signed Thursday that lifted emergency law is seen by the opposition as little more than symbolic , since other laws still give entrenched security forces wide powers . Human Right Watch said Assad `` has the opportunity to prove his intentions by allowing -LRB- Friday 's -RRB- protests to proceed without violent repression . `` The reforms will only be meaningful if Syria 's security services stop shooting , detaining , and torturing protesters , '' said Joe Stork , the group 's deputy Middle East director . A rights activist said trucks carrying soldiers and vehicles equipped with machine guns were seen on the main highway from Damascus to Homs , a central city that has emerged as the new focal point of protests . Residents organized neighborhood patrols after 21 protesters were shot dead Monday and Tuesday by security police and gunmen known as ` al-shabbiha ' . Soldiers in groups of five patrolled the streets of Homs overnight on foot . Plain-clothed security police and security police wearing camouflage uniforms were also present , two witnesses said . `` We are determined on totally peaceful protests ... we rejoice at the downfall of the state of emergency . It was not lifted , it was toppled ... With the help of God , we will embark on freedom , '' a comment on a Facebook page run by activists said . Emergency rule has been used since Assad 's Baath Party seized power to justify arbitrary arrests and detention and a ban on all opposition . Assad 's conciliatory move to lift the state of emergency followed a familiar pattern since the unrest began a month ago : pledges of reform are made before Friday when demonstrations are the strongest , and are usually followed by an intense crackdown . The authorities have blamed armed groups , infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militant organizations for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces . Western and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings in Syria for fear of destabilizing the country , which plays a strategic role in many of the conflicts in the Middle East . Syria is technically at war with Israel but has kept its Golan Heights front with the Jewish state quiet since a 1974 ceasefire . It has long borders with Iraq , and supports the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Shi'ite Hezbollah movement in neighboring Lebanon , also backed by Iran . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . On the other hand Cuba have seen democracy in the horizon for more than 40 years and figure out that it is just something in the horizon anyhow . The smorgasbord is to small even if you would taste the communism . The problem in Syria is not really the Emergency Law or other similar repressive laws on the books . Over the past 50 years of the Assad family dictatorship the pervasive state security apparatus has grown so entrenched and autonomous that it heeds no laws . The feared mukhabarat , as the shadowy state security services are known in Syria , never think of law and order when they kidnap , torture , or disappear freedom activists . The only way for the Assad regime is to disband the 15 + state security agencies it created over the decades and hand the power back to a new reformed judicial system , the first step in a transition of power to a democratically elected civilian government . This would certainly mean the end of the Assad family rule of Syria and end to the monopoly on power by the small Allawite minority . It would be very courageous of Bashar Al Assad to take such action and would save him and his children , but many of his relatives and close associates will be brought to justice over their past human rights abuses , especially the genocide in the city of Hama in 1982 . Without this Syria is heading toward a vicious civil war in which the biggest losers will be the Alawites themselves . It is in this minority 's best interest to negotiate a peaceful and orderly exit from power with the least bloodshed . The Alawites need to be told by the international community that it is now 25 years after the fall of the Soviet Union , their protector , and that there are officials and ex-officials amongst them that are unsavable under international law for their bloody pasts . The minority and its future should not be sacrificed for them . This discussion is now closed . We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication .

LISBON | Fri Apr 22 , 2011 9:28 am BST LISBON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Less than a month after European leaders unveiled a `` comprehensive package '' they said would fix the euro zone , their anti-crisis strategy is fraying and may be in need of a radical rethink . Rising public anger in northern Europe at a series of taxpayer funded bailouts is sending tremors through the political landscape , boosting anti-euro parties such as the True Finns in Finland and sparking open policy rows in European paymaster Germany . The emerging consensus in the markets that Greece will have to restructure its 327 billion euros -LRB- 287.7 billion pounds -RRB- in sovereign debt , in spite of the European Union\\/International Monetary Fund rescue it secured one year ago , has made Europe 's promise to delay any private sector pain until 2013 look increasingly untenable . The flaws in the euro zone 's strategy are being exposed just as it negotiates what is expected to be an 80 billion euro aid deal for Portugal , whose own politicians have been arguing for months that the Greek and Irish bailout model is a failure . This comes against a backdrop of deepening recession or unexpectedly weak growth in Europe 's austerity-hit periphery , which is reinforcing doubts about whether these countries can stage the strong recoveries needed to cut their debt and win back investors once bailout funds run out . As resentment of bailouts rises in the north , opposition to further austerity is growing in the south , creating a dangerous dynamic that some economists and political experts believe could force changes to Europe 's strategy within a matter of months . `` We are at a juncture where the gravity of the economic fundamentals and public opposition to further bailouts may pull the politicians in a new direction , '' said Steen Jakobsen , chief economist at Saxo Bank . `` As long as their strategy is credible they will continue down the same path . But now it looks like we are close to a turning point . The current path no longer looks as credible as it once did . '' There are some signs that would appear to suggest Europe 's strategy is working . Despite an escalation of the euro zone crisis over the past few weeks which has pushed bond yields on Europe 's periphery to record highs , the euro has risen to 16-month highs against the dollar . But that has been driven more by expectations of further interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank than any sense that Europe is closer to solving its crisis . The bloc 's biggest conundrum is Greece , a country whose sovereign debt levels are forecast to rise to 160 percent of annual output over the coming years , on a par with Zimbabwe . Private economists have been saying for months that this debt mountain is unsustainable , but some policymakers in Europe appear only now to be waking up to that fact . The immediate dilemma they face is that the blueprint for their future financial safety net , the European Stability Mechanism -LRB- ESM -RRB- , which is due to be established in mid-2013 , does not give them the flexibility they need to deal swiftly and cleanly with the Greek debt problem . The root of the problem can be traced back to a deal on the ESM struck in Deauville , France last October between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy . That deal foresaw private debt holders sharing in the pain of future debt restructurings . But as markets grew nervous in the weeks that followed , Germany backtracked and pushed back the threat of `` haircuts '' until 2013 . That move now looks misguided . By postponing the real pain until 2013 , the bloc has guaranteed that the threat of a tough restructuring will hang over it like a dark cloud for at least two more years , hurting not only market sentiment towards Greece but also Ireland , Portugal , Spain and possibly others . As Greece 's outstanding bonds mature , the EU and the IMF are pumping money into Greece by extending it emergency loans under the country 's 110 billion euro bailout deal . So when 2013 rolls around , European authorities and the IMF are expected to hold more than half of Greece 's total debt . If they then restructured Greek debt to return the country to a sustainable debt path , they would have to impose an aggressive haircut on themselves . And even after that , Greece might still need support from other European governments , probably for years . The only obvious way to avert this explosive scenario is for Europe to renege on its pledge and hit investors in Greek bonds now , accepting the risk of deterring investment in other countries ' bonds . `` The easiest way out would be to do the restructuring soon , '' said Charles Grant , head of the Centre for European Reform in London . `` Hit the private creditors and recapitalise the banks . It may still happen . '' The wild card remains public opinion and politics . In Germany , the junior partner in Merkel 's coalition is vowing to defend parliament 's right to veto ESM payments . Some lawmakers in the Bundestag want to block approval of the creation of the ESM altogether . The new mechanism is also running into trouble in Slovakia . In Finland , the True Finns party has suggested that a meeting of finance ministers in mid-May to approve a bailout for Portugal could end up producing an `` entirely different '' solution . Europe has seen off political challenges to bailouts in the past ; when Slovakia balked at approving plans for the bloc 's current financial safety net last year , bigger countries pressured it into line . But in the current climate , such pressure may not be so forthcoming . There are no obvious alternatives to a bailout for Portugal , which has said it will run out of funding by June if no bailout is agreed . But the message that the True Finns are sending out -- that taxpayer-funded bailouts are proving costly failures -- could begin to resonate among European leaders at some point .

SHARM EL-SHEIKH , Egypt | Fri Apr 22 , 2011 5:15 pm BST SHARM EL-SHEIKH , Egypt -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Hotel worker Meena George rejoiced when a popular revolt ousted Egypt 's autocratic president , but since the tourists have stopped coming , his joy has given way to fear and desperation . George was made redundant by his employers at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh , and has resorted to borrowing more and more money from his friends to survive . `` The revolution is good , but painful , '' said George , 33 . `` Many of my friends have fallen on hard times as we get laid off , because business is slow . '' From the Pyramids of Giza to the Red Sea resorts , tourist numbers have plummeted to just a trickle , dealing a devastating blow to the millions of Egyptians whose livelihoods depend on the 14 million or so visitors who once thronged to the country . At the height of the 18-day uprising that ousted president Hosni Mubarak , embassies issued travel warnings and many tour groups canceled their trips , throwing an industry that is a major source of foreign currency into crisis . Two months later , the chaos has largely subsided , the police who deserted their posts during protests are mostly back on the job and the travel warnings have been eased . But the tourists have yet to return , and Egypt 's tourism minister has forecast the industry 's 2011 revenue will be 25 percent lower than the previous year . `` I can hardly recall a single tourist coming into my shop recently , '' said Omar Mohamed Saed , the 59-year-old owner of a store selling copper goods in Khan el-Khalili , the main bazaar in Islamic Cairo . `` The uprising killed us . '' Saed was already struggling before the uprising as the number of Western tourists declined due to the global economic downturn . He said the most he had made in one day since the protests was 1,000 Egyptian pounds -LRB- 101.72 pounds -RRB- , adding he had asked his employees to work fewer days so he could afford to pay them . Four families live off the income from Ahmed Salamah 's Cairo souvenir shop . He says he is struggling to feed his own wife and three children from his now meager income . `` I have sold nothing since the revolution started , '' said Salamah , 36 . `` All day I sit in the shop and watch TV . '' At the Giza Pyramids , the country 's most popular attraction and a must-see destination for visitors to Cairo , not one Western tourist could be seen as the sun set on a weekday in April , one of the prime months of the year for holidaymakers . With fewer potential customers , the street vendors and rogue guides that typically hover near Egypt 's famous landmarks seem to be preying more aggressively on tourist wallets . A party of German and French tourists visiting the Pyramids recently said tourist police looked on as a gaggle of touts followed them around the site competing for their attention . `` One thrust an opened can of drink into my hand and demanded I pay for it , '' said German tourist Alex. As the scorching summer approaches , tourism officials are hoping for a pick-up in business from September . But that depends on the security situation , said Brigadier Mohammad Al-Mogati , the Arab League 's assistant for tourism security . Political unrest has waned , but army vehicles can still be see on some streets and embassies are now warning citizens against an increase in muggings , robberies and racketeering in Egypt . War is also raging in neighboring Libya . In Sharm , which hardly saw a whiff of the protests that shook the capital and other cities , glum-faced souvenir merchants idle outside empty shops along an almost deserted walkway at Naama Bay and in the Old Town market . Security has been tight at Egypt 's busiest Red Sea resort since a series of bombings by Islamist militants in 2005 killed over 80 people , most of them Egyptians , and wounded hundreds . Police and security guards patrol resorts , using metal detectors and airport-style x-ray machines to search those entering . Mubarak , who turned the town into a major tourist attraction , is now in Sharm 's hospital . Some residents say his presence in the resort had become a liability . `` Tourists come to Sharm to have a good time , '' said Galal Shabaan , a 33-year-old shop owner . `` You ca n't relax with Mubarak around and the spectre of protests hanging over Sharm . '' Despite an increasingly grim picture , Hala el-Khatib , secretary general of the Egyptian Hotels Association , said nationwide , hotel occupancy was only down by 15 percent in April compared to the same month a year ago . She said hotel occupancy in Sharm had recovered to 32 percent by mid-April from an abysmal 11 percent after the protests erupted on January 25 . But it was still a far cry from the 75 percent rate hotels in the resort are accustomed to at this time of year . Still , Khatib remains optimistic , and says landmarks of the revolution such as Cairo 's Tahrir Square , which became internationally renowned as the gathering place of the protests , are featuring on some tourist itineraries . `` Security is getting better day by day . People have a different view of Egypt , they have a more positive view . They want to include Tahrir in their program , '' she said .

While some analysts believe Assad can contain the revolt through bold reforms , others believe he missed the chance to open up Syria 's dictatorship when he inherited the presidency from his strongman father , the late Hafez al-Assad , in 2000 . `` The regime is in trouble . People have been repressed for 40 years but suddenly the wall of fear has crumbled and they are no longer frightened , '' Sarkis Naoum of Beirut 's an-Nahar newspaper told Reuters . `` Each time the regime makes new concessions , the people get bolder and ask for more . They see it as a sign of weakness . The regime does n't know how to respond -- it 's like an old grudge people have been waiting to avenge . '' Close observers of Syria argue that -- as in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions that ousted Hosni Mubarak and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali -- citizens are rebelling not just against a lack of freedom and opportunity . They are also enraged by suffocating corruption that has enriched the elites while one-third of Syrians live below the poverty line . `` It was a combination of repression , corruption , incompetence and the degeneration of the system , '' says analyst Jamil Mroue . `` It became combustible and people suffocated . '' While crackdowns continued against activists who challenged Baath party rule , economic reforms since 2005 created lucrative new monopolies controlled by senior officials and Assad family insiders , among them his billionaire cousin Rami Makhlouf . `` The Baath Party is ancient , outdated and obsolete . The decisions are being made by the security forces and services who play a fundamental role in the country . They are the real force , '' said Talal Salman , publisher of Beirut 's as-Safir daily , traditionally sympathetic to Syria . A caste of army officers and clans of the dominant Alawite minority has sprung up , using its clout to suppress dissent and extort kickbacks , often demanding a share of the profits private business generates , observers said . `` The essential spark was ignited by the privatizing and franchising of corruption , which along with repression violated the fabric of society , '' Mroue said . As with their Arab peers from Egypt to Yemen and Libya , young Syrians ' aspirations have risen in tandem with their access to satellite TV , mobile phones , Facebook and the Internet . The regional explosion that began in Tunisia and Egypt propelled people to seek a new way of life . What adds an edge to Syria 's crisis is the heavy-handedness of one-party rule , the sectarian rift between the ruling Alawite minority and the Sunni majority , and the brutality and impunity of the security forces . Facing the most alarming challenge of his 11 years in power , Assad has juggled repression , economic handouts and calibrated concessions in an attempt to quash a month of protests . Yet the unrest , which rights groups say has cost more than 200 lives , shows no signs of going away without radical change . On Thursday , ahead of mass protests that broke out again on Friday , Assad ended a draconian state of emergency , in place for 48 years , that allowed blanket repression with impunity . `` President Assad might be able to overcome this crisis and contain the situation but the cost may be high ... He has to change the regime or the people will force him to , '' said Salman . Analysts say toppling the system is harder because Syria 's power structure differs from that of Egypt and Tunisia , where senior generals refused to open fire on demonstrators . Alawite loyalists occupy the key positions in the Syrian military and Assad family insiders run the crucial security bodies , tying senior officers closely to Assad 's own fate . Yet the bulk of the army is Sunni and there have been persistent but unconfirmed reports of soldiers refusing to fire on protesters . `` There is a big possibility that the army will split or they wo n't accept to take part in a crackdown , if ordered . It is not easy to bring the regime down but it is easy to divide the regime , '' An-Nahar 's Naoum said . Nearly 30 years ago , the elder Assad ruthlessly put down an armed Islamist uprising , killing tens thousands of people in the city of Hama in a bombardment cloaked from international view . That level of brutality would be harder to get away with today , when Syrians , despite state curbs on media , use mobile phone cameras to post instant images of protests on YouTube . `` Bashar 's father killed 20,000 to 30,000 people in Hama ... If Bashar wants to do another Hama in the first two hours the whole world will rise up , '' Naoum said . While holding Assad responsible for failing to enact sweeping reforms , some analysts say issues beyond his control played a role , although he should have addressed them faster . The country has been plagued by drought for several years , slowing its rise as a middle income economy . Syria has 20 million people with a population growth rate of 2.4 percent . But entrants to the labor market are increasing at double that pace due to a faster birth rate in earlier decades , that far outstrips the capacity of the economy to create jobs . Per capita gross domestic product languishes at $ 2,500 a year . The official unemployment rate stands at 10 percent but independent estimates are double that , with about a quarter of a million youngsters arriving in the jobs market every year . Some Syrians believe the protest movement , unthinkable a few months ago , has now gained an irreversible momentum . `` There is n't anything impossible any more after Egypt and Tunisia , '' said a Syrian who refused to give her name . `` Seeing Syrians defying the security forces on the streets while knowing that they might be shot dead is something beyond imagination . `` Do you think these people are willing to die just for some reforms or for an increase in wages ? These people want the Assad regime out , '' she added . Even if Assad , 45 , concedes far-reaching democratic reforms , activists and protesters will want proof that he is making a real break with the past , testing the president 's power over his own family and the Baathist elite . `` Assad has to carry out a white coup to clean his entourage of corrupt figures linked to the regime , '' Mroue said . `` He has to show people that there is dramatic change , that there will be elections in a few years , that he wo n't be president for life , that it is no longer a dynasty . '' Such a high-risk course would entail confronting his own entourage and ditching a structure in place for 40 years . No one knows what might come next -- a peaceful transition of power , a military coup , prolonged instability or civil war . `` Either he will opt for transformation of the regime or it will be torn apart , '' Mroue said .

The Local Coordination Committees sent Reuters a list with the names of 88 people , classified by region , the group said were killed in areas stretching from the port city of Latakia to Homs , Hama , Damascus and the southern village of Izra'a . It was not possible to independently confirm the figures . U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the violence and accused Assad of seeking help from Iran . `` This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now , '' Obama said in a statement . `` Instead of listening to their own people , President Assad is blaming outsiders while seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria 's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by his Iranian allies . '' That was an apparent reference to the suppression of anti-government protests in Iran , the biggest since the 1979 Islamic revolution , that erupted after a disputed 2009 presidential election . Tens of thousands of people had taken to the streets of cities across Syria in the biggest demonstrations to sweep the country so far , and called for the `` overthrow of the regime . '' That reflected the hardening of demands which initially focused on reforms and greater freedoms . The protests went ahead despite Assad 's lifting of the state of emergency the day before . Ending the hated emergency rule , in place since the Baath Party seized power 48 years ago , was a central demand of demonstrators , who also seek the release of political prisoners and dismantling of the security services . `` This was the first test of the seriousness of authorities -LRB- toward reform -RRB- and they have failed , '' activist Ammar Qurabi said . Washington urged Syria to stop the violence against protesters and British Foreign Secretary William Hague said emergency law should be `` lifted in practice not just in word . '' Friday 's violence brings the death toll to about 300 , according to rights activists , since the unrest which broke out on March 18 in the southern city of Deraa . Activists cited the highest toll in the nearby village of Izra'a where protesters had been trying to head for Deraa . Residents said 14 people were killed . `` Izra'a is in the dark . No mobile phones or landlines working . People have been talking from villages near to Izra'a but not in the town , '' said Wissam Tarif of human rights organization , Insan . Syrian television said eight people were killed and 28 wounded , including army personnel , in attacks by armed groups in the village . It added an armed group had attacked a military base in the Damascus suburb of Muadhamiya . Amnesty International said it had been told of 75 deaths , including two children and a 70-year-old man . Malcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's Middle East and North Africa director , urged the authorities to stop the violence : `` They must also immediately launch an independent investigation into what happened and ensure that any security forces found to have carried out these killings are brought to justice . '' As in the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings , citizens are rebelling against both a lack of freedom and opportunity and security forces ' impunity and corruption that has enriched the elite while one-third of Syrians live below the poverty line . In the first joint statement since the protests broke out , the activists coordinating the demonstrations Friday demanded the abolition of the Baath Party monopoly on power and the establishment of a democratic political system . Aided by his family and a pervasive security apparatus , Assad , 45 , has absolute power in Syria . Protests swept the country of 20 million people , from the Mediterranean city of Banias to the eastern towns of Deir al-Zor and Qamishli . In Damascus , security forces fired teargas to disperse 2,000 protesters in the district of Midan . In Hama , where Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist revolt in 1982 , a witness said security forces opened fire to prevent protesters reaching the Baath Party headquarters . `` We saw two snipers on the building . None of us had weapons . There are casualties , possibly two dead , '' said the witness . Syria 's third city Homs , where security forces had killed 21 protesters this week when demonstrators tried to gather at a main square , was not spared Friday either . `` I was in the center of Homs and in front of me I heard a security commander telling his armed men : ` Do n't spare them -LRB- protesters -RRB- , ' '' rights campaigner Najati Tayara told Reuters . Witnesses said security forces also shot at protesters in the Damascus district of Barzeh and the suburb of Douma . Al Jazeera showed footage of three corpses , wrapped in white burial shrouds , which it said were from the eastern Damascus suburb of Zamalka . Ahead of the main weekly prayers Friday , which have often turned out to be launch pads for major demonstrations , the army deployed in Homs and police put up checkpoints across Damascus , apparently trying to prevent protests sweeping in from suburbs . After prayers finished in Deraa , several thousand protesters gathered chanting anti-Assad slogans . `` The Syrian people will not be subjugated . Go away doctor -LRB- Assad -RRB- . We will trample on you and your slaughterous regime , '' they shouted . Assad 's conciliatory move to lift the state of emergency followed a familiar pattern since the unrest began a month ago : pledges of reform are made before Friday when demonstrations are the strongest , usually followed by an intense crackdown . Activists said some funerals for those killed Friday took place in Damascus suburbs in the evening . Funerals have been another platform for protesters in recent weeks and security forces have opened fire when mourners started demonstrating . The authorities have blamed armed groups , infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militant organizations for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces . Western and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings in Syria for fear of destabilizing the country , which plays a strategic role in many of the conflicts in the Middle East . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . They want the nation broken into cultural enclaves protected by small militias . National boundaries in North Africa have got to go , they are a stranglehold on multi-cultural needs . The Bathist party is among the most ruthless in history and this al-assad junior is no better than his father . They try to mask their identities with degrees and overseas educations , but unfortunately , you can take them out of the gutter but you cant take the gutter out of them . Even more sad in the region is that without these ruthless dictators , you would have complete anarchy in the streets . Too many different sects\\/tribes and interests . Everyone in the region is worried about their personal benefit first and not that of the common good . The Middle East is a hopeless cause and the sooner we pull out the more we can focus on our own problems here . Taking out these monkeys will only create larger struggles for power which will lead to more dictators and more bloodshed . Just let these people alone and if they kill themselves , than that is their chosen fate . The Arab Spring to democracy must be worrying to Israel which depends on Arab tyrannies and the anti-Israel threat they pose militarily to keep Israel from descending into civil war . Without enemies that is almost certain to happen in Israel , especially if the Arab Spring Democracy Movement also gains hold and wins in the Palestinian territories , leaving only Iran as the big threat unless democracy also takes control in Persia . With that scenario in mind , I wonder what plans the United States has in place to deal with a potential new reality which will see its allied countries like Saudi Arabia and other oil producing sheikdoms the only major anti-democratic and anti-Israel tyrannies left in the region . The next six to 36-months may reshape everything including Israel and the way it governs itself . This discussion is now closed .

The new transport corridor will run from Uzbekistan across Turkmenistan and then to the Gulf via Iran , bypassing chronically unstable Afghanistan next door . `` This is a legally binding agreement ... which allows us to start creating a new geo-economic space , '' Turkmen Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov said before signing the agreement on establishing the transport and transit corridor . He signed the document with his counterparts from Uzbekistan , Iran , Oman and a deputy foreign minister from Qatar . `` This is a historic document ... -LRB- it -RRB- is in the interests of the Central Asian region and the Gulf , '' Uzbek Foreign Minister Elyor Ganiyev told journalists . Officials declined to disclose the length and the cost of the project , or to say when it could be implemented . An official close to the talks said that besides railway transport communication , the five sides are also discussing ways to simplify customs procedures to facilitate trade . Turkmenistan is Central Asia 's No. 1 producer and exporter of natural gas , holding the world 's fourth-largest reserves of the fuel . It also aims to boost its crude oil output more than sixfold to 67 million tonnes by 2030 . Its neighbor Uzbekistan is a major producer of cotton and gold and is also estimated to hold ample hydrocarbon reserves . A Turkmen official said the new transit link could be part of the planned 934-km -LRB- 585-mile -RRB- North-South railway corridor , already being developed to improve Turkmenistan 's access to northern neighbor Kazakhstan and further northwards to Russia . That rail line is due for completion by September 2012 .

Does the West a -RRB- issue statements condemning the excessive use of force ; b -RRB- seek U.N. sanctions and an International Criminal Court investigation ; c -RRB- provide practical support for pro-democracy protesters , d -RRB- intervene militarily ? The answer , to many human rights campaigners , seems to vary unacceptably depending on the state concerned . Western powers which took up arms against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya , citing the United Nations principle of the responsibility to protect civilians , have confined themselves so far to verbal outrage at the killing of some 350 people in Syria . The balance of Western economic and security interests and humanitarian values is different in each case but the perceived double standard is causing anger in the Middle East and among Western publics . `` After Friday 's carnage , it is no longer enough to condemn the violence , '' Joe Stork , deputy Middle East director at pressure group Human Rights Watch , said in a statement . `` Faced with the Syrian authorities ' ` shoot to kill ' strategy , the international community needs to impose sanctions on those ordering the shooting of protesters . '' When the Gulf Arab kingdom of Bahrain called in Saudi troops last month to help quash a pro-democracy movement led mostly by the Shi'ite Muslim majority , the United States and Europe uttered a few pro-forma words of disapproval , then fell silent . The killing in Bahrain was on a smaller scale than in Libya or Syria , and the ensuing arrests , dismissals and disappearances of opponents have drawn less media coverage . More importantly , Bahrain is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet , which keeps an eye on Shi'ite Iran across the Gulf and patrols the world 's most vital oil-export sea lanes . The ruling family in the Gulf island state is so close to former colonial power Britain that the crown prince was invited to this week 's royal wedding in London until he declined the invitation to spare British embarrassment . There are strategic , political and practical reasons behind divergent Western responses to events in Syria , Libya and Yemen , after the initially hesitant Western embrace of democratic change in Tunisia and Egypt . `` All of these situations are different , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on BBC television when questioned about apparent inconsistency . `` So we must n't think that just because we 're doing certain things in Libya , that we would be able or willing to do those things in other countries of the Arab world . '' Hague said that in Libya , there was a direct appeal for help from the opposition and the Arab League had asked the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution and to take action for a no fly zone . Western governments say they prevented an imminent massacre that Gaddafi had threatened to unleash in Benghazi . Gaddafi had lost control of more than a third of his country and his armed forces were brittle and poorly equipped . By contrast , Syria has a well-trained army with Russian missiles and combat aircraft , and suspected chemical weapons , making any Western military intervention utterly implausible . A key strategic consideration is that the West is keen to ensure that Arab uprisings , and the rulers ' responses , do not destabilize the entire Middle East , threatening oil supplies to the industrialized world or triggering wider conflict . Oil has already risen to nearly $ 125 a barrel from around $ 80 last year , partly due to a drop in Libyan supply but also because Saudi Arabia has cut back output , forcing prices up . Riyadh 's move is seen partly as driven by the need to fund huge hand-outs promised by King Abdullah to interest groups to pre-empt any possible unrest in his absolute monarchy . It may also reflect tension between Saudi Arabia and Washington . Some diplomats say Saudi rulers were incensed by the way U.S. President Barack Obama dropped Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , a veteran pro-American stalwart in the region . Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq , the United States ' priority in the region has been to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapons capability which Western and Arab strategists say would be profoundly destabilizing . Syria is Iran 's closest ally and Western powers have been trying for the last two years to woo President Bashar al-Assad away from Tehran and encourage the British-trained eye doctor to reach a peace deal with Israel that could remove a major source of regional friction . After years of unsuccessfully trying to corner Syria over the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , the United States sent an ambassador back to Damascus this year . France appointed a special envoy last summer to facilitate back channel contacts between Syria and Israel , and Turkey , Spain and Germany have also been involved in passing messages , diplomats say . If the West seeks a Security Council condemnation of Assad or a referral of the repression to the ICC , Russia , an historic ally of Libya , may well veto any resolution . Western diplomatic action could push Syria more tightly into the arms of Iran and risk retaliation by Syrian-allied Hezbollah forces in Lebanon either against Israel or European troops policing a southern Lebanese buffer zone . Western diplomats say they are also concerned at the risk of sectarian conflict in Syria , dominated for nearly five decades by an Alawite minority close to Shi'a Islam . Violence involving Sunni Arabs , Alawites , Kurds and Druze could embroil neighboring Turkey , Lebanon and Iraq . So while Western governments are likely to step up rhetoric against Assad and explore the scope for targeted U.N. sanctions and an ICC referral , there is little they can do to affect the outcome of the popular uprising .

The measures , which could freeze the officials ' assets and ban them from doing business in the United States , would likely come in an executive order signed by U.S. President Barack Obama , the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity . But a final decision has yet to be made and there was no word on whether Assad might be a target , the official said . Sanctions would mark a more assertive approach by the Obama administration , which has been criticized by human rights groups for not doing more to curb Assad 's efforts to crush a monthlong uprising against his autocratic 11-year rule . Obama 's response to the Syrian crisis has been limited compared to Washington 's role in a NATO-led air campaign against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces and its call for his ouster . Obama spoke by phone with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and the White House said they expressed deep concern about the violence in Syria . `` The leaders agreed that the Syrian government must end the use of violence now and promptly enact meaningful reforms that respect the democratic aspirations of Syrian citizens , '' the White House said . Washington is mindful of its limited ability to influence Damascus , which is already under a set of U.S. economic sanctions and is closely allied with U.S. foe Iran . The Obama administration is also worried about stoking instability on U.S. ally Israel 's borders and wants to avoid another military entanglement in the Muslim world , where it is involved in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . Despite that , U.S. officials were looking for new pressure points with Assad as his tanks poured into Deraa , where a human rights activist said at least 18 people were killed . White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration was `` pursuing a range of possible policy options , including targeted sanctions ... to make clear that this behavior is unacceptable . '' But he declined to say whether measures might be imposed against Assad himself , if Syria 's oil industry might be targeted or whether there might be a broader push for U.N. sanctions . Even as he heaped criticism on Syria 's actions , Carney kept a mostly cautious line on Assad 's fate and stopped short of urging him to step down . `` It is up to the people of Syria to decide who its leader should be , '' he told reporters . Obama , sharpening his tone in a statement on Friday , said Syria 's crackdown `` must come to an end now '' and accused Damascus of seeking Iranian help to repress its people . Assad lifted a 48-year state of emergency on Thursday but activists say violence the following day , when 100 protesters were killed , showed he was not serious about reform . Questions have been raised whether new U.S. sanctions against Assad and his aides -- like the steps taken against Gaddafi and his loyalists -- would have much tangible impact . The United States and other Western powers have been trying for two years to woo Assad away from Tehran and encourage the British-trained eye doctor to reach a peace deal with Israel . The Obama administration sent an ambassador back to Damascus this year . Even while maintaining support for Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas militants , Assad has kept Syria 's border with Israel quiet . Western sanctions could push Syria more tightly into Tehran 's embrace and risk further regional instability by stoking sectarian strife . -LRB- Editing by Deborah Charles and Doina Chiacu -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

ATLANTA | Tue Apr 26 , 2011 4:30 pm BST ATLANTA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Soaring jet fuel costs pounded Delta Air Lines -LRB- DAL . N -RRB- and US Airways Group -LRB- LCC . N -RRB- in the first quarter , leading both to post losses , but rising fares eased the blow , and Delta said it aims to recapture the full cost of fuel on every flight . Results from the two carriers on Tuesday -- marking the end of quarterly reports from the largest U.S. airlines -- underscore the threat of rising energy costs . But Delta 's particularly aggressive stance signals new determination to keep passing that cost on to customers through fare hikes and other means . Delta 's stock gained 8 percent in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange . `` We must fully recapture our costs on every flight every day to maintain and improve our earnings performance , '' Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson said on an earnings conference call . `` Where we can not get the necessary revenue increases to offset the increased cost of operating the flights , we will remove capacity , particularly in our post Labor Day schedule , '' he said . Airlines have steadily boosted fares this year as more than $ 100-a-barrel oil threatens to wipe out the industry 's recovery from the economic downturn . Carriers are reporting higher passenger demand , but costs are also rising . Industry analysts were impressed by Delta 's tone , but expressed doubt about whether passengers will tolerate higher fares . `` You 're not seeing them in a state of panic like they were , say , in 2008 because so far demand has been so strong they 've been able to pass through most of these additional costs , '' said Ray Neidl , senior aerospace specialist with Maxim Group . `` But at some point , you 'll get consumer push-back for ticket price increases , '' he added . Morningstar equity analyst Basili Alukos said Delta 's goal of recovering the full cost of fuel on each flight may not be practical . '' -LRB- It 's -RRB- very aggressive , if you ask me , '' he said . `` The only way for that to occur is if the legacy carriers abandon the leisure passenger and focus exclusively on the premium passengers . '' Alukos added that if major airlines raise fares too aggressively , low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines -LRB- LUV . N -RRB- will win a greater share of budget travellers and `` undercut the legacy carriers on pricing . '' The company projected `` double-digit growth '' in passenger revenue per available seat mile in the current quarter . US Airways posted a loss , excluding special items , of $ 110 million , or 68 cents per share . The loss was wider than a year earlier but not as bad as analysts ' average forecast of 72 cents a share . Revenue was $ 3 billion , up 11.7 percent . Operating expenses were also $ 3 billion , up 12.8 percent , due primarily to a $ 272 million jump in fuel costs . Shares of Delta were up 8 percent at $ 9.72 in morning trade . Shares of US Airways were up 5 percent at $ 8.69 . -LRB- Reporting by Karen Jacobs , John Crawley and Kyle Peterson ; editing by John Wallace -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "330", "dct": "2011-04-26", "dates": ["2011-04-26", "2011-04-26", "2011-04-26", "2005-01-01", "2011-04-25"], "text": "ISTANBUL | Tue Apr 26 , 2011 1:54 pm EDT ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Members of the Syrian opposition meeting in Istanbul on Tuesday pleaded for international help to persuade President Bashar al-Assad to halt a brutal crackdown on a popular revolt . `` Our friends in the West , in Turkey , in the Arab world , if they want to help us , then they can do that by ... putting the clearest possible pressure on the Syrian regime to stop targeting civilians , '' Anas Abdah , the British-based chairman of the Movement for Justice and Development , told Reuters . Abdah was speaking on the sidelines of a gathering of opposition and rights groups organised by Turkish non-government organizations to highlight the Syrian people 's plight . Hundreds have been killed by Syrian security forces since pro-democracy protests began six weeks ago . The violence intensified in recent days with an assault on Deraa , the heart of the uprising , but opposition members living in exile took heart from reports of dissent within the army . `` It looks like Bashar al-Assad has taken a strategic decision to crush a non-violent movement in Syria by ordering his brother Maher al-Assad ... to go and storm Deraa city , '' Abdah said . Maher , regarded as the second most powerful man in Syria , commands the ultra-loyal Fourth Division -- the Syrian Army 's equivalent of special forces . Abdah said he had reports that some army officers from another division , from captains to a lieutenant-general , were trying to stop the Fourth Division from entering the city . `` At this moment of time we have reports that certain elements in the Fifth Division are not responding in the way Bashar and Maher want them to , and are siding with the people , '' Abdah said . The Fifth Division is stationed in the south of Syria , on a plain overlooked by the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights , and its ranks are filled with Sunni Muslims . Syria has been dominated for nearly five decades by an Alawite minority close to Shi'a Islam , and the army 's officer corps is dominated by Alawites , though its ranks are mostly Sunni . `` The Syrian army is a national army . They will stand by the people eventually , '' said Rabhan Ramadan , an Austrian-based Syrian Kurd working with the Haitan Maleh Foundation , a rights group in Brussels . `` Right now we are beginning to see some members of the military refusing to shoot . It is just the beginning , but we expect to see more of that , '' he added . Abdah said he was in Istanbul as a representative of signatories of the 2005 Damascus Declaration , which has become an umbrella group for the Syrian opposition and has a program for political and economic reform . `` However at this moment in time all of this is irrelevant and meaningless if targeting of civilians were to continue by the Syrian regime , '' he said . Turkey 's President Tayyip Erdogan , who has had friendly relations with Assad , has urged Assad to refrain from using excessive force and to undertake reforms his people are seeking . The United States is considering targeted sanctions against Assad 's government and on Monday , President Barack Obama conferred with Erdogan about the turmoil . Syrian human rights organization Sawasiah has estimated at least 400 people have been killed since the uprising began . Walid Saffour , the London-based president of the Syrian Human Rights Committee , put the toll at more than 700 , and added that 5,000 people had been arrested . Syria has expelled most foreign journalists , and getting independent corroboration of casualties is impossible . Saffour said he had reports of at least one soldier being executed for refusing to fire on civilians in Deraa , and spoke of some officers and soldiers fleeing to Jordan to seek asylum . `` The situation is very , very horrific , '' Saffour said .

LONDON | Tue Apr 26 , 2011 7:30 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - London 's Westminster Abbey will be adorned with seasonal British flowers , shrubs and trees mainly sourced from royal estates for the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton . An avenue of trees lining the aisle and leading to the altar will be the main feature of the display , which is based around growing , rather than cut plants , in line with the bride-to-be 's desire that it should be sustainable . London-based florist Shane Connolly , 47 , who is in charge of the displays , said he had been in regular touch with Middleton and that the flowers would not give a message of `` wow , what an extravagance , '' but `` how beautiful . '' `` I suggested right from the beginning that we would use things from the royal estates because her whole ethos has been that it had to be British ... and that it had to be seasonal and as organic to the place as possible , '' he said . The plants will include blossoms , azaleas , rhododendron , euphorbias , beech , wisteria and lilac , royal officials said on Tuesday . Eight 20-foot high trees , six English Field Maple and two Hornbeam , will be the most prominent feature and they will be in planters designed by Connolly , who was chosen by the couple for his reputation for producing `` elegant and unique '' displays . Tradition dictates that the bride 's bouquet consists of white flowers but Connolly would not divulge any details . However , he hinted there could be a hidden message in the bouquet , as some flowers are said to convey certain meanings about love , romance , and fidelity . `` One of the things that has been very important to Catherine and to me are the meanings of flowers and the language of flowers , '' said Connolly , who also arranged the flowers for the second marriage of William 's father Prince Charles in 2005 . `` We 've tried , especially in the wedding bouquets , which you 'll see on the day , we 've tried very much to make beautiful stories . '' Whatever the design , media have reported that Middleton is expected to leave her flowers on a memorial in the abbey to an unknown soldier from World War One , following a tradition started by the queen 's mother at her wedding in 1923 . After the wedding , the other flowers and plants will be left at the church until May 6 for the public to view . After that , many of the trees will be taken to Highgrove , Charles 's residence in Gloucestershire . The couple hope that other cut plants and flowers will be donated to charities or re-planted . -LRB- Reporting by Michael Holden ; Editing by Steve Addison -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "106", "dct": "2011-04-27", "dates": ["2011-04-27", "2011-04-27", "2005-01-01", "2011-04-26", "2011-04-22", "1990-01-01", "2011-04-26", "2011-01-01", "2005-01-01", "2009-01-01"], "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Apr 27 , 2011 7:44 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The unrest sweeping Syria may whip up sectarian divisions that could spill across the border and threaten to destabilize Lebanon , a small neighbor where Damascus has both strong allies and enemies . Tension already smolders in Lebanon , where the powerful Shi'ite militant movement Hezbollah , supported by Syria and Iran , is at odds with caretaker Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri , backed by the West and the Sunni Arab kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Tiny Lebanon , with around four million people , has always been a battleground for bigger regional powers . Syria , which had a military presence for 29 years until 2005 , remains the most influential external player in Lebanon 's sectarian politics . `` We have sides here who are linked to Syria and others who are enemies of it -LRB- who -RRB- would drag us into the crisis . God forbid if something happened there , Lebanon is not going to be immune , '' analyst Nabil Bu Monsef said . The upheaval in Syria , where a rights group said on Tuesday 400 people have been killed by security forces , has sectarian undercurrents because of President Bashar al-Assad 's minority Alawite rule in a mainly Sunni Muslim country . Alawite loyalists occupy pivotal positions in the Syrian military and Assad family insiders run the crucial security bodies , tying senior officers closely to Assad 's own fate . `` If there is sectarian tension between Alawites and Sunnis in Syria this will definitely spill over to Lebanon , '' said a Lebanese analyst , alluding to past fighting between Alawites and Sunnis in northern Lebanon . `` We have growing numbers of Sunni hardliners , this is clear , and it is all over the Middle East , and from the other side we have the Shi'ites getting more hardline -- because of the conflict between Iran and the Gulf states . All of this is growing , so we should be scared . We are not immune , '' he said . `` When these countries were stable , we were paying a heavy price because of their interference , so imagine now that there is trouble there . We will pay an even heavier price . '' For security reasons many Lebanese analysts declined to comment or be quoted by name for this article . Underlining the tension , a little known Sunni militant group staged an anti-Assad demonstration in Lebanon 's northern city of Tripoli on Friday and chanted demands for an Islamic caliphate . Some analysts said Hezbollah might tighten its already strong grip on Lebanon 's political fortunes if it felt that its main ally in Damascus was weakening . A cosmopolitan Mediterranean country with 18 sects , Lebanon endured a 15-year civil war characterized by ethnic and sectarian bloodletting between Muslims and Christians . The war ended in 1990 but many Lebanese felt justice was not served and many households still keep guns to hand , including AK-47 assault rifles and even rocket-propelled grenades . `` There is already plenty of tension in Lebanon and the Syria unrest will complicate relations in Lebanon , especially between the -LRB- Sunni -RRB- Future Movement led by Hariri and Hezbollah , '' a political science professor at a Lebanese university said . Syrian authorities , trying to crush five weeks of protests against Assad 's authoritarian rule , have accused a Lebanese lawmaker from Hariri 's bloc of stirring up the demonstrators and providing them with weapons to attack security forces . Legislator Jamal al-Jarrah denied this . But , in a sign of the hairtrigger tension , pro-Syria Lebanese and Palestinian parties held a news conference immediately after the Syrian accusations and denounced what they called `` foreign interference in Syria . '' Some accused Hariri himself of being behind the demonstrations . `` Lebanon is stable when Syria is stable . There is no security in Lebanon without security in Syria , '' Hezbollah lawmaker Nawaf al-Mussawi said at the conference . Nabih Berri , the parliament speaker and head of Lebanon 's Shi'ite Amal group , a Hezbollah ally and very close to Syria , said on Tuesday Lebanese had to `` care for Syria 's security and stability more than the Syrians themselves . '' He added , `` We warn against any attempt to export strife and chaos in Syria because it will ignite a fire in the Middle East that can not be extinguished . '' Hariri has not commented on the events in Syria . `` What I see in these coming weeks is that Syria will fight by putting pressure on their opponents in Lebanon via their allies to try to contain their opponents in Lebanon , '' said Nicholas Noe , a Beirut-based analyst . Lebanon has been without a government since Hezbollah and its allies toppled Hariri 's unity coalition in January in a dispute over a U.N.-backed tribunal investigating the 2005 assassination of statesman Rafik al-Hariri , Saad 's father . Hariri accused Syria of killing his father and although he mended fences to a certain extent with Damascus in 2009 , relations between them remain edgy . The toppling of Hariri 's government after Hezbollah and its allies resigned from it , and their support of businessman Najib Mikati to replace him angered Sunnis , who saw it as flagrant Shi'ite interference . Mikati insists he is politically neutral . `` As if Lebanon does not have enough fire , Syria -LRB- unrest -RRB- will be like a spark for many of the problems that have been buried for the past two years , '' said another political commentator .

Indeed , some are in denial about what they are witnessing . Hezbollah , the Lebanese Shi'ite movement widely seen as an Iranian proxy in the Middle East , purports to believe the government of President Bashar al-Assad is putting down an insurrection by armed gangs of Salafi or Sunni Muslim fanatics . In its report of the Syrian army 's assault on the southern city of Deraa , epicenter of the revolt which began last month , Al Manar , Hezbollah 's television , stuck to the official version that the army responded to citizens ' pleas to put an end to `` killings and terrorizing operations by extremist groups . '' Hezbollah greeted with glee uprisings that overthrew dictatorships in Tunisia and Egypt and championed the rights of Bahraini protesters against Saudi military intervention to quash Shi'ite demonstrations . But it is distinctly unenthusiastic about the risk of losing the support of a Syrian government which is not only its main protector but the conduit for arms supplies from Iran . Tehran , which regards Syria as a close ally in a mainly Sunni-dominated region suspicious of non-Arab Shi'ite Iran , has called the revolt in Syria `` a Zionist plot . '' Yet Israel too seems deeply uneasy about any change in the status quo . Although they are still formally at war , Syria under the current president and his late father , Hafez al-Assad , has maintained a stable border with the Jewish state since 1973 even though Israel still occupies the Golan Heights . Israel 's fear -- voiced more openly by commentators plugged in to its security establishment than by politicians -- is that a successful uprising might replace firm Baath party rule with a more radical government , or one less able or willing to keep radical forces on a leash . Although Assad sponsors Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , he has played a cautious hand . Behind the strident Arabist rhetoric and ties with Tehran he has kept the option of peace with Israel in play and sought acceptance by Western powers . `` The implications are enormous and totally unpredictable , '' said Lebanon-based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri . `` What makes Syria distinctive is that the regime and the system have close structural links with every conflict or player in the region : Hezbollah , Hamas , Iran , Lebanon , Israel , America , Iraq , Turkey . In all these -LRB- cases -RRB- there is a Syrian link . '' Demonstrations have spread across the country and grown in intensity , he said , and protesters who began calling for reform of the system were now demanding `` the overthrow of the regime . '' At the back of many minds is the experience of Iraq , plunged into years of chaos and sectarian savagery after the US-led invasion in 2003 and removal of Saddam Hussein . `` Everybody in the region is concerned about the destabilization of Syria , even those who do n't like Assad , because there is one thing he brings to the region : a certain kind of predictability and stability , '' Khouri said . `` He maintained the truce along the Syrian-Israeli border , people know how his government behaves . Nobody knows what will happen afterwards . '' Alex Fishman , a military affairs journalist for Israel 's best-selling daily Yedioth Ahronoth , summed up Israeli apprehension after the Syrian army stormed into Deraa . `` However odd it may sound , the Israeli establishment has a certain sentiment for the Assad family . They kept their promises throughout the years and even talked about an arrangement with Israel on their terms , '' he wrote . `` It 's hard to part with a comfortable old slipper , but the top members of the political and security establishment believe that the Syrian regime , in its current format , will change within weeks or months , '' Fishman said . He added : `` The sole interest guiding Israel 's conduct is : if what is happening in Syria will ultimately weaken the Damascus-Iran-Hezbollah axis -- we 'll come out ahead . '' For Hezbollah and Iran , losing Assad would certainly be a big blow . `` If it -LRB- Syria -RRB- splits into mini-satellite states that will be bad news for everybody , '' Khouri said , suggesting that as in Iraq this might provide an opening for al Qaeda militants . Across the border in Lebanon , arena of a sectarian civil war in 1975-90 that sucked in regional and world powers and left Syria in control for 29 years , people are also worried . Any prospect of a new sharpening of tensions between Sunnis and Shi'ites , Arabs and Kurds , or Christians and Muslims , all simmering across the region after being brought to the boil by Iraq , produces shudders . `` I do n't think any wise man is not worried about what happens in Syria because it is a neighbor , '' said Talal Salman , editor of Beirut 's daily as-Safir . `` Any earthquake in Syria will shake Lebanon with its fragile make-up . Syria 's stability is in our interest . '' For now , Assad has decided to follow in the footsteps of his father and resort to military force , not reform , to put down the protests at a cost so far of more than 400 lives , according to human rights groups . Monday 's deployment of tanks in Deraa looks like an indicator of what is to come . A source close to the Syrian military said Assad and his security establishment had taken a decision to wage war on protesters across the country . But Ali al-Atassi , a prominent Syrian activist whose father was a former president jailed for 22 years by the elder Assad , said `` another Hama '' was impossible . In 1982 , Hafez al-Assad sent in the army to crush an armed lslamist uprising , killing of up to 30,000 people . `` Syria has reached a turning point . It can not go back to where it was , '' said Atassi . He said the Western habit of accommodating dictatorships in return for stability was no longer valid . `` In Tunis , Egypt and elsewhere for years , Arab leaders and the West gave the Arab people a binary choice : stability or chaos ; despotism or Islamism . `` After what happened in Tunis and Egypt , we discovered that there is a third option which is the democratic way . Sure , the Islamists will play a role in it , but they will not have the leading role , '' Atassi said . While many analysts argue that life after Assad would be hazardous or that he may prove impossible to remove , others say a relatively smooth transition is imaginable over time because Damascus has institutions that can shoulder responsibility . They include the army , whose backbone is Sunni although key posts are controlled by members of Assad 's Alawite minority . What most observers now dismiss is the possibility of reforms substantial enough to meet popular demands . Even if Assad wanted to enact wide-scale reforms , they argue , he lacks the power to prevail over entrenched interests in the security forces and military intelligence . `` He is the prisoner of a certain structure and at the same time part of it , '' Atassi said . `` The next 2-3 weeks are really critical . They will determine whether he will remain in power or whether his regime will collapse , '' Khouri told Reuters . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The reluctance to shed ` stability ' will be widespread , as the internet-savvy Arab youth persists with its demand for a fair say in government , whether under the more obviously despotic regimes or unelected regimes which are currently supporting some of the revolutions against other unelected regimes ! However , youth is owed its say , as it has its whole life ahead of it . I guess that Hazballah has lost its popularity among syrians as resistance movement after describing protesters as infiltrators and conspirators . When it comes to Israel , I guess that the next political system in Syria will be truely against israel and will work to get back its occupied land . And syria will get back to its normal arab circle but will keep good relations with Iran in order to work as a mediator between Iran and the arab nations but if a conflict arose , it will for sure take the side of the arabs . Governments such as Syria and Iran will never fall . They have the military on their side and decades of experience in putting down peoples opposition by para military troops whom are trained just for this scenario .

The Central Bank raised rates by 0.25 percent last month after pressure from high fuel and food prices drove inflation up . The bank had cut rates to 5 percent from 5.25 percent last July , the lowest level in the last decade . `` The Board believes the current monetary conditions are adequate for achieving the inflation target and continuing to stimulate economic activity , '' Central Bank Governor Ardian Fullani told a news conference . -LRB- ID : nLDE72M1SG -RRB- The governor said the bank will stop paying 0.7 percent of the European Central Bank or U.S. Federal Reserve basic interest rate for 10 percent of the overall hard currency deposits banks hold as obligatory reserves at the central bank . Fullani said the bank took the decision because the high level of hard currency transactions in banking and the country was a weaknesses of the Albanian economy . A large migrant worker community in Albania 's European Union neighbors Greece and Italy meant they sent euros back home at a rate of up to one billion a year until the onset of the financial crisis saw remittances drop to around 700 million . Around 30 percent of total lending is in Albanian leks and the remainder in euros because loans in euros , and dollars , are cheaper . `` This measure will effectively prompt commercial banks to cut the costs of collecting funds , favoring -LRB- financial -RRB- intermediation in the local currency , '' Fullani said . A central bank official said zeroing the interest payment for reserves means banks would not maintain current levels of interest on deposits on the euros and dollars . `` The lek still remains expensive , '' one economist told Reuters after being told about the decision . The measure comes also as the Albanian lek EURALL = has been losing ground steadily to the euro and traded at its all-time lows in what Fullani and traders see as a `` new equilibrium of the exchange rate .

The 45-year-old leader has tried economic carrots , political concessions and brute force to try to quell a popular upheaval that rights groups say has cost over 450 lives in six weeks . Syria , mired in its gravest crisis since Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist revolt in 1982 , risks international opprobrium and sanctions for its repressive response . The Assad family 's grip on power looks at its shakiest in 30 years . Instability in Syria , fulcrum of several Middle Eastern conflicts , carries huge but as yet uncertain implications for its neighbors , notably Lebanon and Israel , and for the region . Here are some of the key risks to watch . What sparked the revolt was the arrest of 15 youngsters for scrawling anti-government slogans in the southern town of Deraa , where the first three deaths occurred on March 18 . Protests gradually spread across Syria as people demanded freedom from three decades of Baath Party rule , against a background of grievances over economic hardship and corruption . Assad , portraying unrest as the work of armed gangs paid by malign powers , replaced his government and coughed up a series of concessions that did not mollify protesters increasingly enraged by the bloodshed inflicted by security forces . Their initial chants for reform soon gave way to the battle cry of Arab uprisings that had already unseated the rulers of Egypt and Tunisia : `` The people want the downfall of the regime . '' On April 21 Assad ended 48 years of emergency law and scrapped a hated state security court , but the killing of 100 protesters the next day seemed to make these moves a mockery . Similarly , limited prisoner releases were counterbalanced by the detention of hundreds of other dissenters and protesters . Economic handouts and job creation promises failed to calm the resentment of many Syrians who believe only a small group of crony capitalists has benefited from Assad 's reforms , ostensibly aimed at overhauling an inefficient socialist-style economy . So far the armed forces and security services , many of whose commanders belong to Assad 's family and his minority Alawite community , appear to have remained loyal -- unlike in Egypt and Tunisia where the military helped usher presidents from power . Assad 's ousting is no foregone conclusion . His opponents may have breached the barrier of fear that has long underpinned Baathist rule , but ruthless repression could re-erect it . The president can also play the `` me-or-chaos '' card which resonates with many Syrians . Some fear that militant Islamists could fill any power vacuum , others that civil war might engulf their country , as in next-door Lebanon and Iraq in the past . -- Any signs of mutiny among the army and security forces -- Any signs of protesters taking up arms The United States has condemned Assad 's use of force -- he sent army tanks into Deraa and two suburbs of Damascus on April 25 -- but Western nations which launched air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi 's Libya have not acted against the Syrian leader . The Arab League , which swiftly suspended Libya 's membership over Gaddafi 's efforts to quell opposition , has remained silent on Syria , although it issued a blanket condemnation on April 26 of the use of force against pro-democracy Arab protesters . Western criticism of Assad 's crackdown was initially muted , partly because of fears that a collapse of his minority Alawite rule might lead to sectarian conflict with the Sunni majority or bring to power Islamist militants hostile to Israel . The United States , which had sought to isolate Syria after the 2005 assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri , has more recently attempted to engage it , hoping to loosen its alliance with Iran and move it toward a peace deal with Israel . Neither policy proved very successful . Israel is in two minds . The removal of Assad , a foe who is allied with Iran and backs Lebanon 's Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad , would seem a bonus . Yet Assad and his father have kept the border mostly quiet since the 1973 war , even though Israel still occupies Syria 's Golan Heights . No country has much leverage over Syria . Even Turkey , which has developed close links with Damascus in the last few years , has seen Assad ignore its advice to enact reforms . The United States has kept sanctions on Syria since 2004 . Its European allies may now impose travel bans or asset freezes on the Syrian leadership . Any move for U.N. sanctions is likely to be opposed by veto-wielding Russia , an old ally of Syria . Iran could be a big loser if Assad 's rule collapses because Syria , its main Arab ally since 1980 , has facilitated Tehran 's efforts to build a Middle Eastern `` axis of resistance '' to Israel and the United States via Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . Lebanon , Iraq and other countries will worry that any ethnic or sectarian conflict in a destabilized Syria could spill across their borders , fuelling regional tensions between Arabs and Kurds , Christians and Muslims , or Sunnis and Shi'ites . \\* Any Arab League position on Syria The turmoil will hit an economy grappling with unemployment , poverty , and water and power shortages , along with falling oil output and rapid population growth of 2.5 percent a year . The International Monetary Fund said on April 27 Syria was set for 3 percent growth in 2011 versus 3.2 percent in 2010 , with inflation reaching 6 percent against 4.4 percent last year and the fiscal deficit widening to 6.8 percent of GDP from 4.8 . The unrest has ravaged the tourism industry , one of Syria 's fastest-growing sectors , and may scare off foreign investors -- Syria has delayed bidding for its third mobile operator license , Saudi Telecom , one of the bidders , said on April 27 . A government goal of luring more than $ 40 billion in private investment to overhaul creaking infrastructure and create jobs over five years had looked implausible even before the protests , given corruption levels and uncertainty about the rule of law . Foreign direct investment fell to $ 1.4 billion in 2009 from $ 2.4 billion in 2008 , according to the World Bank . Syria , now a net oil importer , needs to invest in refineries to cut fuel import costs in a country that produces 380,000 barrels per day of crude , down from a 590,000 bpd peak in 1996 . Despite fiscal strains , Syria has opened the spending taps to try to calm discontent , cutting taxes on some foods , giving cash to poor families , reducing income tax , raising the minimum wage and extending health cover to civil service pensioners -- measures the IMF says will cost about 2 percent of GDP . Unemployment is officially 10 percent . Independent estimates say it is closer to 25 percent . The International Labor Organization says 60 percent of those aged 15 to 24 lack jobs . Tougher international sanctions would inflict more economic pain -- without necessarily swaying Syrian policy-makers . U.S. sanctions bar the export of certain goods with over 10 percent of U.S.-produced components , restrict dealings with the Commercial Bank of Syria and ban the U.S. financial system from dealing with individuals linked to militant groups . Any punitive measures by the European Union , which accounted for 36 percent of Syria 's exports and 29 percent of its imports in 2008 , would probably target Syrian leaders , not trade . \\* Worsening budget deficit , pressure on Syrian pound An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "189", "dct": "2011-04-27", "dates": ["2011-04-27", "2011-04-27", "2011-04-26", "2011-04-26"], "text": "GELSENKIRCHEN , Germany | Wed Apr 27 , 2011 8:12 am BST GELSENKIRCHEN , Germany -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Schalke 04 are in need of a minor miracle if they are to have any hope of advancing past Manchester United to the Champions League final after slumping to a 2-0 home defeat without as much as a fight . It is not so much Tuesday 's 2-0 first leg loss that leaves them facing a mountain to climb in Manchester 's `` theater of dreams '' but the lack of belief they can turn the tie around against a team that could have easily won by five goals . The fact that Schalke had not lost any of their last nine Champions League matches before Tuesday and won all of their five previous home games in the competition makes their work in Manchester even more difficult . `` Our starting position now certainly points to Manchester having the advantage but in football you never know , '' Schalke coach Ralf Rangnick said . The German coach , who took over five weeks ago from Felix Magath said this short time had not been enough to bind his players into a unit capable of seriously challenging the three-time European champions . `` Manchester were on a different level than Inter Milan -LRB- in the quarter-finals -RRB- . We reached our limits . We will certainly need a wonder to progress , '' he said . Schalke , 10th in the Bundesliga with no real chance of playing in the Champions League next season , take on Bayern Munich on the weekend hoping a win could restore some of their lost confidence after United ripped their defense to shreds for over an hour in a one-sided game . `` We will not give up in the second leg but the result is pretty clear , '' said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who prevented an embarrassingly high-score defeat with half a dozen superb saves . His performance was the solitary Schalke highlight , prompting United coach Sir Alex Ferguson to label it the best by any goalkeeper against United in his years in charge . To have any chance in the return leg Schalke need more than just an in-form Neuer . They must beat United at home , with Manchester having yet to lose this season in the entire competition , let alone at home . `` Why should we capitulate ?

After an unprecedented surge in gas costs last summer , Britain 's gas market should return to its normal mid-year price lull , offering some short-term relief to big industrial users who buy on the wholesale market in an economy barely staggering out of recession . Wholesale gas prices in Britain -- a benchmark for global gas sales -- surged in mid-March on fears that leading liquefied natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- buyer Japan would need more fuel to make up for nuclear plants shut by the March 11 tsunami . But fears of a resulting diminished supply to Europe have not been realized , and shipments from two huge new Qatari LNG plants , which together can produce 15.6 million tonnes a year -LRB- mtpa -RRB- , have already swollen UK gas stocks to more than double the levels seen last year . And despite a deal to sell Japan an extra 4 million tonnes of LNG from the new plants , Europe is still likely to get more LNG this summer than last , some analysts say . `` They can send 4 million tonnes to Japan and still send more to Europe , '' leading independent LNG consultant Andrew Flower said , adding Japan 's deal would probably only reduce the flood of Qatari LNG that would have otherwise have landed in Europe . Influential U.S.-based investment bank Goldman Sachs sparked a rally in UK gas prices this week when it said UK gas prices were likely to rise significantly in 2011 and 2012 due to reduced gas supply from Libya and Japan 's newfound gas needs . But other analysts say there should be plenty to spare . `` We project that Europe will import 6.18 million metric tons in May , a year-over-year increase of 0.52 million tonnes or 9.1 percent , '' Waterborne LNG analysts said in their latest European LNG outlook . `` That will be driven primarily by the ramp-up of Qatari volumes into the UK . '' The U.S.-based LNG specialists revised up their EU import forecasts following surprisingly high imports in the weeks since the tsunami and now expect European imports for April to be 20 percent above the year-ago level . Although there appear to be fewer tankers heading for northwest Europe than the long line of vessels queuing up in late March , a steady stream of deliveries continues . Gas prices usually wilt in English summers when heating demand is low , and stocking-up for the next winter is one of the few price supports . In 2010 , a shutdown for maintenance of about half of Qatar 's LNG production trains provoked an unprecedented summer surge in prices on Europe 's biggest gas market . Qatari exporters plan some maintenance this year , but last summer 's rally seems unlikely to be repeated , because Qatar has since increased production capacity by 25 percent , of which Japan bought only a quarter last week . UK gas prices for fuel delivered the next month surged about 15 percent from March 10 to March 16 , when front-month contracts hit a 26-month high of 65.95 pence per therm -LRB- $ 10.85 per mmbtu -RRB- . Prices have since fallen in a deluge of LNG from mostly Qatar and many other suppliers seeking to benefit from the UK price surge . But prices for gas delivered in the UK market next month are still about 80 percent higher than a year ago and nearly double levels two years ago . Prices should fall as supply exceeds demand . Societe Generale said in an April 19 report that UK gas prices were `` much too high , '' pointing to weak demand , plentiful spare export capacity in Russia and few LNG diversions to Japan . Thanks also to a mild end to winter , Britain 's biggest gas storage site has about 85 percent more gas than a year ago , while stocks at recently expanded LNG terminals are near record highs . So there is a lot less space to stash excess fuel over the next few months , unless it can be re-exported to Belgium via a pipeline , which has already been pumping record volumes this year as European buyers gobble up cheap gas . `` With summer round the corner , I believe prices should fall further , '' senior SocGen gas and LNG analyst Thierry Bros said on Tuesday , after UK gas prices fell about 5 percent in the week since the bank published its latest European gas price outlook . SocGen says that producers would have to slash production to maintain gas prices above 50 pence per therm -LRB- $ 8.29 per mmbtu -RRB- over the summer , and the French bank doubts they would dare behave like a cartel for fear that European politicians turn away from an increasingly gas-reliant energy strategy . Analysts ' estimates of the additional gas Japan will need this year vary from 5 bcm to nearly 15 bcm . Libya had exported about 10 bcm of gas a year to Italy and Spain before civil war shut its exports down in February . By comparison with these numbers , the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- forecast in November that the global oversupply of gas was set to rise above 200 billion cubic metres -LRB- bcm -RRB- in 2011 -- largely because of a boom in North American shale gas production that has left many LNG sellers including Qatar scrambling for new buyers .

But the current futures market is bullish so even if 50,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- go out , prices will go ballistic , '' an oil trader with a major bank said Thursday . The European Union will discuss in Brussels Friday possible sanctions against Syria 's leadership over its crackdown on protesters , EU diplomats have said . Any sanctions would probably begin with asset freezes and travel bans on the leadership and it could take up to two weeks before the measures formally pass into law . If measures are taken against the leadership , state oil export monopoly Sytrol is likely to be affected . Syrian security forces have shot dead at least 400 civilians in their campaign to crush month-long pro-democracy protests , Syrian human rights organizations have said . The United States is also considering sanctions against Syrian government officials to increase pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to end the crackdown . `` Pressure on Syrian elites keeps mounting ... However , a condemnation of Syrian actions by the U. N , Security Council has so far been thwarted by Russia , China and Lebanon , '' said David Wech from JBC Energy . Syrian crude oil output was around 400,000 bpd in 2010 compared with a peak of around 600,000 bpd in the 1990s . Today 's volumes are only a fraction of Libya 's output of 1.6 million bpd or around 2 percent of the global consumption , which has been shut by sanctions and a civil war since March . RUSSIAN CRUDE TO GET SUPPORT A key difference with Libya is that Syria exports mainly sour and heavy crude , which is harder to process than the sweet and light Libyan oil that yields more light products such as gasoline and gasoil . U.S. and Brent oil futures , as well as premiums on sweet versus sour grades , have rallied since March after Libya stopped exporting its predominantly sweet barrels . Brent oil futures traded above $ 125 a barrel Thursday , not far from their highest level since August 2008 . `` This would mean that a possible shut-in would not be too dramatic for the European crude market as it would be relatively easy to find substitutes for Syrian Heavy , particularly as there is plenty of sour crude available in the region , something that can not be said for light-sweet grades , '' Wech said . Syria 's two key production streams are the sour and heavy Souedie crude , which yields lower quality products , and the sweet and lighter Syrian Light grade . More than half the output is processed at domestic refineries , which can refine around 240,000 bpd , while some 150,000 bpd or around 6 tankers a month of mostly sour Souedie is exported mainly to Italy , the Netherlands , France and Spain . An Italian refiner said interest in the Souedie grade was low as the official selling price of minus $ 10.6 per barrel to the benchmark dated Brent was still too high , given the poor returns to be gained at present from refining heavy oil . `` This is a minor problem for the market since you do n't have the physical tightness even despite Libya . But the very bullish futures market has long been ignoring fundamentals , '' said a trader at a trading firm in the Mediterranean . The trader said Syrian exports would halt very quickly if sanctions were imposed on the country as international banks would quickly stop accepting payments , as they did with Libya . `` Although the impact on the physical market will be limited , some similar grades might benefit -- primarily -LRB- Russia 's -RRB- Urals , -LRB- Iraq 's -RRB- Kirkuk and Iranian Heavy , '' he said . -LRB- Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ikuko Kurahone , editing by Anthony Barker -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "29", "dct": "2011-04-28", "dates": ["2011-04-28", "2011-04-28", "2011-04-22", "2011-04-28", "1066-01-01", "1981-01-01", "2011-04-29", "2011-04-01", "1997-01-01", "2011-04-22", "2005-01-01"], "text": "LONDON | Thu Apr 28 , 2011 11:01 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Crowds camped out in London and foreign dignitaries flew in from around the world for Friday 's wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton , a service full of pomp and ceremony that has thrust the monarchy to center stage . Underlying the diplomatic minefield of an event taking place in the full glare of the world 's media , Britain withdrew Syria 's invitation , saying Syria 's crackdown on calls for democracy made it inappropriate that its ambassador should attend . Middleton , 29 , accompanied by William 's younger brother and best man Prince Harry , attended a rehearsal on Thursday at the wedding venue , Westminster Abbey , the coronation church for the monarchy since William the Conqueror in 1066 . In the evening , Prince William reached into the crowds waiting on the Mall , the ceremonial avenue running from Buckingham Palace , shaking hands and telling delighted members of the public he was focusing on `` remembering the lines '' for the `` big day , '' a live BBC broadcast showed . In a message of thanks to well-wishers worldwide , the couple said they were deeply touched by the outpouring of affection ahead of a wedding service that will combine ancient traditions of the monarchy with a sense of modernity to reflect the times . In the service , Middleton will not promise to `` obey '' William as part of her wedding vows in front of a congregation gathering royals , politicians , celebrities and friends . `` We are both so delighted that you are able to join us in celebrating what we hope will be one of the happiest days of our lives , '' William , second in line to the throne , and Kate wrote in a statement printed in an official souvenir program . On the street across from the abbey , crowds began to swell at a makeshift campsite , with tents draped in British `` Union Jack '' flags , pictures of the couple and banners reading `` It 's cold but worth it '' and `` It could have been me . '' `` I 'm a romance novelist so I had to come for the most romantic event in the world , '' said Sheree Zielke , 55 , who came from Canada to watch the event -- which is being met by republicans with indifference and by royalists with excitement . Cindy Sagar , from Oxford in central England , said she had been one of about 600,000 who watched the 1981 wedding of William 's father Prince Charles to Princess Diana . `` It was electric , it was one of the best days of my life . '' Tourism chiefs predict an extra 600,000 visitors will be in the capital on Friday , taking the total to about 1.1 million and bringing in up to 50 million pounds -LRB- $ 80 million -RRB- . Security will be tight , as Britain is on its second highest threat level meaning an attack by militants is considered `` highly likely , '' and police have carried out thorough searches along the route . Militant Islamists and Irish republicans , anarchists , and stalkers are all seen by security experts as possible threats . Across London , flags and red , white and blue bunting fluttered across buildings and shops , with similar scenes in cities , towns and villages across the country . Prime Minister David Cameron said Britons `` felt deeply '' about the constitutional monarchy , which went through scandals in the 1990s -- notably William 's parents ' divorce -- and has described the nuptials as `` unadulterated good news . '' Some Britons , however , are indifferent or hostile as the wedding comes at a time when government austerity measures are leading to deep spending cuts and large-scale job losses . While the royal family and the Middletons will pay for the ceremony and reception , the taxpayers will foot the bill for security costs , which republicans say could exceed 10 million pounds . An Ipsos MORI poll for Reuters this month found 47 percent of Britons were not very , or not at all , interested . `` I want to get as far away as possible from the wedding because it really does n't mean anything to me , so my wife and I are going for a long weekend to Italy , '' Londoner Alex Joseph told Reuters . Artist Ollie Sam , 26 , commented : `` It makes me laugh that many people here are leaving town to get away for the long weekend , while foreigners are coming to see the wedding . I personally think it 's a waste of money . '' The government estimates about two million people will join 5,500 street parties in England and Wales , though officials said the affluent south seemed more royalist than the poorer north . Economists say the extra public holiday will cost billions of pounds and could damage Britain 's fragile economic recovery , one saying it will knock a quarter of a percentage point off second-quarter GDP growth . Abroad , the world 's fascination with the British royal family is undiminished . An estimated 8,000 journalists have arrived in London to cover the ceremony , and hundreds of millions across the world will watch on television . That interest stems partly from the lasting appeal of William 's mother Diana , particularly in the United States . Fourteen years ago , the world 's gaze was upon William and Westminster Abbey for Diana 's funeral after her death in a Paris car crash , and William and Kate want her to be remembered on Friday . They have included the final hymn sung at her funeral among their choices ; Diana 's friend Elton John , who sang `` Candle in the Wind '' at her funeral , will be a wedding guest ; and William gave Kate her dazzling sapphire and diamond engagement ring . William , now 28 , was 15 when his hugely popular mother died and the image of the prince and his brother Harry walking behind their mother 's funeral cortege was striking . While Diana 's death marked a low point for senior royals -- their cool reaction in sharp contrast to a huge outpouring of public grief -- they hope William 's wedding will ignite enthusiasm and modernize the monarchy 's image . Kate , from an affluent middle-class background , is seen as adding a dash of glamour , reportedly winning William 's attention by appearing at a charity fashion show in little more than her underwear . Diana 's death and other scandals saw support for the House of Windsor dive in the 1990s but their approval ratings are now much improved . Three-quarters of those polled for Reuters last week said they favored Britain remaining a monarchy . The revival of the family fortunes meant there was little opposition when Charles married his long-term lover Camilla in 2005 , a marriage thought inconceivable less than a decade earlier because of Diana 's public standing . Kate , whose parents run a successful business and whose mother 's ancestors were miners , will be the first commoner to marry a monarch-to-be since Anne Hyde wed the future James II in the 17th century . `` Their marriage will breathe new life into the monarchy as the queen enters the twilight of her reign , bringing new blood and a fresh perspective to an institution that faces criticism for being elitist and out of touch , '' royal biographer Claudia Joseph told Reuters .

Troops stormed into Deraa , cradle of a six-week-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad 's authoritarian rule , a week ago to try to crush protests that have spread across the country of 20 million . Power and communications have been disrupted . On Saturday , tanks shelled the old quarter of the southern city and security forces stormed the Omari mosque , a focal point for protests . `` The shelling has intensified . It is the worst night . Women and children are on their rooftops chanting ` God is Greater ' against the tyrant , '' one resident , who lives in the Manshia neighborhood in the old quarter told Reuters by telephone . He said security forces were entering homes and dragging men onto buses . The chants echoed the calls of Iranian protesters who took to rooftops in Tehran chanting ` Allahu Akbar ' -LRB- God is Greatest -RRB- during post-election unrest in 2009 . Foreign correspondents have largely been excluded from Syria since the protests escalated and the crackdown began . A Syrian rights group said at least 560 civilians have been killed in the six-week-old uprising in support of demands for greater political freedom and action against corruption that has flourished under the Baath Party , in power since 1963 . The uprising , unthinkable only months ago , flared after mass protests toppled authoritarian leaders in Egypt and Tunisia . Demonstrations spread in Bahrain and escalated to civil war in Libya . Newly appointed Prime Minister Adel Safar was quoted by state news agency SANA as saying his government would in the coming weeks draw up a `` complete plan '' of political , judicial and economic reforms . The pledge was unlikely to dampen the intensity of protests . A severe crackdown followed the once-unthinkable gesture of lifting a decades-old emergency law this month . The government also has little influence as Assad , his family and the security apparatus has a stranglehold on power . Syria blames armed groups for the violence . On Friday soldiers killed 19 people when they fired on protesters who were trying to enter Deraa from nearby villages in a show of solidarity , a medical source said . Syrian rights groups put Friday 's death toll at 62 . SANA quoted an official military source as saying on Saturday that army and security forces units had been chasing `` armed terrorist groups '' who had attacked properties in Deraa . The source said six members of the group were killed in the operation , 149 wanted people were arrested , and a large cache of weapons and ammunition had been seized . Two members of the security forces were also killed and seven wounded . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

Ismail Haniyeh , head of the Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip , called bin Laden a martyr . `` We condemn the assassination and the killing of an Arab holy warrior , '' Haniyeh told reporters . `` We regard this as a continuation of the American policy based on oppression and the shedding of Muslim and Arab blood . '' Hamas , classified by the United States and the European Union as a terrorist group over its violence against Israel , is due to sign a unity deal this week in Cairo with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 's more secular Fatah movement . Israel has condemned the agreement , saying it could sabotage any efforts to revive peace talks with the Palestinians . The deal envisages an interim unity government comprised of independents and Palestinian elections later in the year . The Fatah-led PA supports a negotiated peace with Israel to obtain a state in territories the Jewish state captured in a 1967 war . Hamas is officially sworn to Israel 's destruction . Abbas has defended reconciliation with Hamas , saying it reflected a deep-seated Palestinian desire to close a rift with the group that seized Gaza from Fatah forces in 2007 . The United States has responded coolly to the unity pact . In the West Bank city of Ramallah , the PA 's view on the death of the mastermind of the September 11 , 2001 attacks was shared by Ahmed Saleh , a 58-year-old retiree . `` The world is better without bin Laden . This has removed a pillar of evil from the world , '' he said . `` His heinous actions were exploited to allow hostile policies towards the Arabs and Muslims . '' But Umm Mohammed , a veiled woman , said she hoped news of bin Laden 's death was a lie . `` God willing , he will continue to conquer the West , '' she said . Palestinians hit the headlines after the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington , carried out by al Qaeda , when a small group were filmed celebrating in East Jerusalem . At the time , there were bigger demonstrations in the Gaza Strip in support of the attacks . Palestinians partly blame their national plight on generations of U.S. support for Israel . But late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat banned such public displays and voiced sympathy for the dead in the United States . In Gaza , Hamas now faces a challenge from al Qaeda-inspired groups that consider it to be too moderate . One such group was behind last month 's killing of a pro-Palestinian Italian activist in the territory . Abdel-Qader Abu Shaaban , a 53-year-old Palestinian from Gaza , described bin Laden 's killing as `` a very criminal act . '' `` This is not a victory . If they assassinated bin Laden , there will be others stronger than him : politicians and military people , '' he said .

LONDON | Tue May 3 , 2011 12:48 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday that Britain must remain vigilant against potential reprisals following the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan by U.S. forces . British embassies have been asked to review their security measures , but the formal threat level at home was unchanged . Cameron , who will make a statement to parliament on Tuesday , said in a televised reaction from his official country residence Chequers that bin Laden 's death would be `` welcomed right across our country . '' `` Of course , it does not mark the end of the threat we face from extremist terror . Indeed , we will have to be particularly vigilant in the weeks ahead . But it is , I believe , a massive step forward , '' he said . A government crisis committee met late on Monday to discuss bin Laden 's death . `` The group welcomed -LRB- President Obama 's -RRB- announcement and agreed it was an important step forward in the fight against terror , '' a spokeswoman for Cameron 's office said in a statement . `` They agreed to continue to make every effort to counter terrorism and extremism . '' The group , known as `` Cobra , '' convenes in emergencies and brings together officials from various departments . Separately , in phone calls with the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan , Cameron said Britain would work `` extremely closely '' with both countries `` to tackle the terrorist threat from Al Qaeda and from the Taliban , '' Cameron 's office said in a statement . Foreign Secretary William Hague said he expected heightened vigilance at posts abroad for `` some time to come . '' `` There may be parts of al Qaeda that will try to show that they are still in business in the coming weeks as indeed some of them are , '' Hague told BBC Radio 4 , during a trip to Cairo . The Foreign Office advised Britons overseas to avoid large crowds and public events , and Defense Secretary Liam Fox said he had directed his department to `` maintain a high level of vigilance in all UK defense facilities at home and abroad . '' Britain remains at its second-highest threat level of severe , meaning a militant attack is considered highly likely . Cameron said bin Laden , who was killed on Monday in a firefight with U.S. forces in Pakistan , had been responsible for ordering the death of many British citizens both at home and in other parts of the world . In July 2005 , four young British Islamists inspired by al Qaeda killed 52 commuters in suicide bomb attacks on the capital 's transport network . Sixty-six Britons died in the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , on New York and Washington . `` Above all today we should think of the victims of the poisonous extremism that this man has been responsible for , '' Cameron said . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair , in power at the time of the 2005 and September 11 attacks , said in a statement : `` The operation shows those who commit acts of terror against the innocent will be brought to justice , however long it takes . '' Obama phoned Cameron early on Monday , a Downing Street spokeswoman said . Bin Laden was killed in a compound in Abbottabad , north of Islamabad , despite the general assumption that he had been in the mountainous region between Afghanistan and Pakistan . Fox said it was important Pakistan was fully committed to the battle against international terrorism and he hoped the killing would see a renewed commitment because `` the threat from al Qaeda will not go away with the death of one man . '' `` In Pakistan , it is essential that they have a battle against both the Pakistan Taliban and the Afghan Taliban , it is not sufficient to choose just one or the other .

Using a campaign strategy that reflected his governing style and personality , Harper 's message to voters was that Canada needed a stable Conservative government to ensure economic recovery and low taxes . After losing the 2004 election to the Liberals , Harper led the Conservatives to victory in 2006 and 2008 , but emerged from those wins with minority governments that needed the support of at least one opposition party to stay in power . Harper , who turned 52 during the campaign and is an economist by training , is the third-longest serving Conservative prime minister since World War Two . He is not required to call another election until 2015 . He maintains strict control over his government to try to avoid negative press , and he is known to have an aloof public personality . His five-week campaign tour around Canada seemed a reflection of this . The Conservatives ' campaign allowed only limited media access and audience members had to register in advance to attend rallies . The campaign protected front-runner Harper from the gaffes of the past elections that fuelled voter fears he had a hidden right-wing social agenda that he would enact with a majority government . He rejected criticism late in the campaign that he had ignored the surprise surge of New Democratic Party , who are traditionally election also-rans but ended up eclipsing the Liberals to emerge as a serious election foe . Harper faces a Parliament far different than before the campaign . The left-of-centre NDP is now the official opposition , the centrist Liberals reduced to an historic low and Bloc Quebecois , which advocates independent for Quebec , all but eliminated . Harper has an instinctive distrust of big government and red ink . During the 2008 election campaign he scoffed at the idea of a big economic crash or recession . But he turned with other world leaders to Keynesian economics to dig out of the recession , running the biggest budget deficit , in absolute dollar terms , in Canadian history . Harper cut his political teeth in the Western province of Alberta , which long felt excluded from the traditional power centres in the east . He rose to prominence in the 1990s as a legislator for the right-of-centre Reform Party , which campaigned under the slogan `` The West wants in . '' Harper quickly became frustrated and returned to Alberta , where he urged that the province erect a firewall to prevent interference from the federal government . In 1997 , he said Canada was a `` welfare state in the worst sense of the term . '' Yet he was soon back on the national stage , winning the leadership of the Canadian Alliance -- the successor to Reform -- in 2002 and then pushing through a merger with the Progressive Conservatives to form the new Conservative Party . Largely thanks to that merger , the Conservatives took power in 2006 , when the forces on the centre-left were divided . Harper is married with two young children and is writing a book about ice hockey , Canada 's passion and its national winter sport . His wife Laureen , once an eager motorcycle rider , generally keeps a low profile . -LRB- With additional reporting by Randall Palmer ; editing by Will Dunham -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "59", "dct": "2011-05-03", "dates": ["2011-05-03", "2011-05-03", "2011-05-03", "2011-01-01", "2011-01-01", "2010-01-01", "2005-01-01", "2011-01-25", "2012-01-01", "2006-01-01", "2010-01-01", "2005-01-01", "1975-01-01", "1990-01-01", "2011-04-28", "2010-01-01", "2010-01-01", "2011-04-28", "2011-01-01", "2011-01-01", "2010-01-01"], "text": "BEIRUT | Tue May 3 , 2011 12:59 pm EDT BEIRUT May 3 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Deeply divided Lebanon , with no government since January , now faces extra risks from instability in its powerful neighbor Syria , where President Bashar al-Assad is staging a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters . The domestic political crisis and the spillover effects of the turmoil in Syria are damaging the Lebanese economy , expected to grow only 2.5 percent this year , down from 7.5 percent in 2010 , according to the International Monetary Fund . Any conflict in Sunni-majority Syria , where Assad 's minority Alawites have long held a disproportionate share of power , could fuel political and sectarian tensions in Lebanon , as well as disrupting trade , tourism and capital inflows . Also hanging over Lebanon are possible indictments by a U.N.-backed special tribunal of Hezbollah members in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese ex-Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri . Here are some of the key risks to watch : A political alliance dominated by Hezbollah , an armed Shi'ite Islamist movement backed by Syria and Iran , toppled the previous government led by Saad al-Hariri over his refusal to cut links with the tribunal seeking to try his father 's killers . Najib Mikati , a Sunni , was designated prime minister on Jan. 25 . But disputes over cabinet posts involving Hezbollah and its Shi'ite and Christian allies , as well as President Michel Suleiman , have blocked his efforts to form a government . One of the knottiest problems pits Suleiman against Michel Aoun , leader of the biggest Christian bloc in parliament , who wants to name the next interior minister as part of his share of cabinet posts . Suleiman insists on keeping his nominee , Ziad Baroud , in the job , whose mandate includes organising elections . Mikati has yet to disclose how he would deal with the Hariri tribunal , which is now revising secret indictments issued in January . It is not clear when they will be made public . Hezbollah , which denies any role in Hariri 's killing , wants the next government to withdraw funding and Lebanese judges from the `` politically motivated '' court based in The Hague . Enjoying Saudi and U.S. support , Saad al-Hariri , the main political voice of Lebanon 's Sunni community , has become more outspoken in support of the tribunal since his government fell . Israel , which fought a 34-day war with Hezbollah in 2006 , has said it will target all of Lebanon in any new conflict because of the Shi'ite group 's growing clout in government . The upheaval across the Arab world has shoved Lebanon 's problems out of the limelight . No foreign mediators have stepped in since joint Saudi-Syrian mediation collapsed late last year . \\* Publication of indictments by special tribunal Lebanon 's stability has long depended on Syria , which wields influence via Hezbollah and other local allies , even though it was forced to end a 29-year military presence in 2005 . The challenge to Assad family rule in Damascus is another complicating factor in Lebanon 's already intricate politics . It may energise anti-Syrian Lebanese factions , or spur Hezbollah to tighten its own grip if it feels its Syrian ally is weakening . Syria could easily stir strife in Lebanon , still recovering from its 1975-90 civil war , if it wanted to . It blames the unrest in Syria on Islamist groups and has accused pro-Hariri politicians of inciting and arming anti-Assad protesters . Turmoil in Syria is already spilling over the border . Some Syrian dissidents , including a prominent blogger , are now in Lebanon . Hundreds of Syrians fled into northern Lebanon on April 28 after gunfire erupted on the Syrian side of the border . The instability in Syria , Lebanon 's only overland outlet , has also disrupted transport and trade . The prolonged political uncertainty in Lebanon , now coupled with turmoil in Syria and elsewhere , is taking its toll on an economy badly in need of reform and infrastructure investment . Apart from lower growth , the IMF report also forecast that inflation would rise to 6.5 percent from 4.5 percent in 2010 and that the fiscal deficit would widen to 10.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- from 7.2 percent last year . The Central Bank has ample foreign reserves of $ 31 billion to help keep the Lebanese pound LBP = stable . But after three years of impressive GDP growth , warning signs are flashing . Caretaker Finance Minister Raya al-Hassan said on April 28 that activity in all sectors , including tourism , real estate and retail , was down . A capital outflow of about 1 percent of bank deposits had occurred in January , when political tension spiked . Many depositors have switched into dollars , despite higher interest rates offered on the Lebanese pound , prompting banks to conserve their local currency holdings , rather than buying the treasury bills on which government financing relies . Lebanon 's public debt is expected to rise to $ 55 billion in 2011 from $ 51 billion in 2010 . Analysts say it could hit $ 65 billion in the next three to five years unless the government cuts spending and boosts revenues to cut the fiscal deficit . But even if a proper government was in place , higher food and fuel prices have increased public discontent , making it harder to implement any austerity measures .

Hamas is not in the PLO . \\* It originally backed armed struggle to create a Palestinian state but later led peacemaking efforts with Israel for a deal to create a state in the West Bank and Gaza , with East Jerusalem as capital -- lands Israel occupied in 1967 . \\* Fatah chief Arafat signed the first peace interim peace deal with Israel in 1993 but despite repeated U.S.-brokered efforts , a full accord has always proved elusive , with Israelis and Palestinians blaming each other for repeated failures . The last round of direct talks broke down last September . \\* Arafat died in 2004 and was replaced as Fatah head by Mahmoud Abbas in 2005 . He inherited a divided party that was losing its popular support and mired in corruption scandals . \\* After decades of dominance , Fatah lost a 2006 parliamentary election to Hamas . A year later its forces were routed by Hamas in a civil war and ousted from the Gaza Strip . Its power in the West Bank has been reduced by persistent internal struggles and its influence has waned with the rise of the technocrat prime minister , Salam Fayyad . \\* Hamas is the largest Palestinian militant Islamist group . It was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian Intifada , or uprising . Originally it concentrated on armed struggle against Israel , led by its armed wing the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades , and on numerous social welfare programs . However , it soon got deeply involved in local politics . \\* Hamas believes Palestinians must use force in their struggle with Israel and opposes negotiation . The group 's founding charter calls for the destruction of Israel . Hamas has since said it would accept the establishment of a Palestinian state next to Israel and a long-term truce as a `` transitional solution . '' It has also said it would `` respect the will of the people , '' suggesting it would accept a referendum endorsing a `` two-state '' deal with Israel . \\* Due to its refusal to renounce violence and recognize Israel , many Western powers view the group as a terrorist organization . Hamas launched waves of suicide bombings against Israelis in the 1990s and during the second Intifada , which erupted in 2000 . \\* Hamas is part of a regional alliance comprising Iran , Syria and the Shi'ite Islamist group Hezbollah in Lebanon , which all broadly oppose U.S. policy in the Middle East . Its main leader , Khaled Meshaal , lives in Damascus . \\* Hamas rule in Gaza survived an Israeli military offensive in 2008-2009 , triggered by rocket attacks into Israel . About 1,400 Palestinians , including hundreds of civilians , and 13 Israelis died in the conflict . Analysts say support for Hamas in Gaza has shrunk after years of blockade and isolation . -LRB- Compiled by Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Mohammed Assadi ; editing by Crispian Balmer\\/David Stamp -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "199", "dct": "2011-05-06", "dates": ["2011-05-06", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-09", "2011-05-06", "1982-01-01", "2001-01-01", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-05", "2011-05-06", "2011-03-18", "2011-04-29", "2011-04-30", "2011-05-05", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-05", "2011-05-06"], "text": "Syrians living in Greece burn posters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , in solidarity with anti-government protesters in Syria , outside the Syrian embassy in Athens , May 6 , 2011 . AMMAN | Fri May 6 , 2011 9:30 pm BST AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian security forces killed 23 protesters on Friday demanding an end to President Bashar al-Assad 's rule , rights campaigners said , and the European Union agreed to impose sanctions in response to his crackdown . Activists and witnesses said demonstrations broke out after the main Friday prayers in cities across the country of 20 million people , from Banias on the Mediterranean coast to Qamishly in the Kurdish east . The bloodiest confrontation took place in the city of Homs where 15 protesters were killed , activist Ammar Qurabi said . State television said an army officer and four police were killed in Homs by a `` criminal gang , '' though another activist , Wissam Tarif , said witnesses told him nine soldiers defected in Homs to the protesters and may have clashed with other troops . International criticism has mounted against Assad , who has gone on the offensive to maintain his family 's four-decade grip on power and crush demonstrators demanding freedom . European Union governments agreed on Friday to impose asset freezes and travel restrictions against up to 14 Syrian officials responsible for the violent repression , which rights campaigners say has killed more than 580 people . Officials give a lower death toll and say half the fatalities have been soldiers and police , blaming `` armed terrorist groups '' for the violence . They say demonstrators are few in number and do not represent the majority of Syrians . Assad himself was not among those immediately targeted under the sanctions , which follow last week 's EU agreement in principle to impose an arms embargo on Syria . The measures will be approved on Monday if no member state objects . Assad 's security forces and troops , which stormed the city of Deraa last week , have prevented demonstrators establishing a platform such as Egypt 's Tahrir Square by blocking access to the capital Damascus . But every week protesters have used Friday prayers to launch fresh marches . `` The people want the overthrow of the regime , '' shouted 2,000 demonstrators in the Damascus suburb of Saqba . A youth riding a motorbike was later killed in Saqba when he approached a roadblock and soldiers opened fire on him , a witness said . Footage released on the Internet and aired on Al Jazeera television showed protesters in several towns and cities echoing the same calls for freedom and change of leadership . In Hama , where Assad 's father brutally suppressed an armed Islamist uprising in 1982 , a rights activist said security forces shot dead six demonstrators when they fired at a protest . The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a protester was killed in Latakia and three others wounded . Despite the harsh crackdown , protesters appear determined to maintain demands for an end to years of repression , arrests without trial and corruption by the ruling elite . `` The Syrian people will not back down after the country 's budding youths were killed in their hundreds , '' said Montaha al-Atrash of the Syrian human rights organization Sawasiah . Opposition leader Riad Seif , who helped initiate a peaceful movement seeking political freedoms and democracy 10 years ago , was arrested at one of Friday 's protests , his daughter said . Authorities also arrested on Thursday prominent Damascene preacher Mouaz al-Khatib , a major figure in the uprising , human rights campaigners said on Friday . A Western diplomat said 7,000 people had been arrested since the demonstrations broke out on March 18 in Deraa . The United States , which sought for the last few years to engage Damascus and loosen its anti-Israel alliances with Iran and militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas , imposed further targeted sanctions against Syrian officials last Friday . Last week , Assad ordered the army into Deraa , cradle of the uprising that began with demands for greater freedom and an end to corruption and is now pressing for his removal . An ultra-loyalist division led by his brother Maher shelled and machine-gunned Deraa 's old quarter on Saturday , residents said . The United States condemned the assault as `` barbaric . '' Syrian authorities said on Thursday the army had begun to leave Deraa , but residents described a city still under siege . `` With our soul and blood , we will sacrifice for you , Deraa , '' chanted 20,000 protesters in nearby Jassem on Friday . Thousands more converged on the town of Tafas , 12 km -LRB- 8 miles -RRB- northwest of Deraa , which remains encircled by tanks , carrying placards with the word `` leave . '' Aid workers from the Red Cross and Red Crescent delivered their first emergency relief supplies to Deraa on Thursday , bringing drinking water , food and first aid materials . They had no immediate information on casualties in the city . Human Rights Watch cited figures from Syrian rights groups saying 350 people had been killed there . It urged authorities on Friday to `` lift the siege '' on the city and to halt what it called a nationwide campaign of arbitrary arrests .

The demonstration by as many as 7,000 people in the far-flung mountains of Dien Bien Province , near the northwestern border with Laos and China , began several days ago , but details were scant from the hard-to-access region . Several officials in the area were contacted by telephone but declined to comment . A Catholic priest based close to the region , citing followers in the area , said troops had been deployed and the protesters had detained at least one government official sent to negotiate . Demonstrations on this scale are rare in Vietnam , where the ruling Communist Party brooks no opposition . Dien Bien is one of Vietnam 's poorest provinces and people who have traveled there say road , water and power infrastructure in rural areas is rudimentary . Vietnam has 54 recognized ethnic groups including numerous minorities in its northern and central mountains , some of whom opposed the central government in the years after the end of French colonial rule . Hmong are hill people , originally form southern China , some of whom have migrated to mountainous parts of Vietnam , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Pham Thanh Binh , a Catholic priest based in the hill town of Sapa , who oversees followers in the area where the protest was taking place , said his contacts in the region told him the military had cordoned off demonstrators and cut electricity and telecommunications . Troops were not allowing people in or out of the protest area and the demonstrators had detained one or more government officials sent to negotiate . It was unclear when that happened or if the officials had been released . The U.S.-based Centre for Public Policy Analysis , which advocates for the Hmong , said 28 protesters were killed by the army in a crackdown , but that could not be verified . A U.S. embassy spokesman said its diplomats had not confirmed reports of violence . `` We urge all parties involved to avoid violence and resolve any differences peacefully and in accordance with Vietnamese law and internationally recognized human rights standards , '' the U.S. embassy spokesman said . Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said in a statement , quoting a government official from the region , `` several '' Hmong had gathered under the belief that a `` supernatural force '' would lead them to the promised land and they would have health , happiness and wealth . `` Taking advantage of the situation some bad elements tried to provoke the crowd and mobilise to establish an independent ` kingdom ' of the Hmong , disturbing the social order , security and safety of the locality , '' Nga said in the statement late on Thursday . Authorities in the region sent officials to `` convince '' the demonstrators that they should not believe in fabrications and that the push for independence led by bad elements went against Vietnam 's policy of national unity , she said . Some of the Hmong demonstrators had returned home , she said , but `` the situation in Muong Nhe is still being resolved by all levels of party and government so that the lives of the compatriots there can return to stability at an early time . '' A diplomatic source said 5,000-7 ,000 people had been involved in the unrest and one of the demonstrators had apparently proclaimed himself king . The BBC reported in Vietnamese that army units had been sent to quash the demonstration , which started on April 30 , a national holiday in Vietnam to celebrate the liberation of the Saigon , as the main city in the south was known , at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 . The BBC quoted an official in the area as saying authorities had tried to negotiate with the demonstrators . On May 7 , 1954 , Communist guerrillas defeated French colonial forces in the fabled battle of Dien Bien Phu , in Dien Bien . Almost exactly 21 years later the Communists went on to depose the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government . -LRB- Editing by Martin Petty and Robert Birsel -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "313", "dct": "2011-05-06", "dates": ["2011-05-06", "2011-05-06", "2011-02-01", "2009-01-01", "2010-01-01"], "text": "MANAMA | Fri May 6 , 2011 9:00 am BST MANAMA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Along with its business friendly reputation , another casualty of Bahrain 's crackdown on anti-government protesters could be its crown prince , seen as more reform-minded than others in the ruling family . The fading influence of Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa puts at stake efforts to liberalise Bahrain 's economy and attract global businesses . `` There is no doubt that the hardliners are in control and that there has been a shift in the internal balance within the regime , '' said Shadi Hamid , analyst at the Brookings Doha Centre . The crown prince had advocated dialogue with Sunni-led Bahrain 's Shi'ite majority in February to try to defuse tension with mostly Shi'ite protesters who demanded a bigger say in the country 's political and economic affairs . But the dialogue failed to take off and the government decided to impose martial law and clear out protesters , aided by troops from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies . Since then , Sheikh Salman has virtually disappeared from public view and Bahrain 's Sunni ruling family appears to be putting his younger brother Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa more in the spotlight . `` It looks as if the hardliners would like to groom Sheikh Nasser , '' a Gulf-based diplomat who declined to be named said . `` He 's on state media almost every day now . '' A graduate of Sandhurst military academy , Nasser , 23 , has so far kept out of the spotlight and is known for participating in endurance equestrian events . He wed the daughter of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum in 2009 . At stake are reforms Sheikh Salman initiated to open up the economy to international and local investors , which in turn were aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil income and enable the private sector to create jobs for Bahrain 's youth . `` Bahrain does not have the luxury to be hesitant on reform , '' said John Sfakianakis , chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi . `` It now competes with business-friendly financial centres in Qatar , Abu Dhabi , and of course Dubai . If businesses leave they will be received elsewhere , '' he said . With government finances in a precarious position , Bahrain , a small oil producer , can not afford to plough more funds into ailing state companies such as national carrier Gulf Air GULF . UL , which Sheikh Salman wanted to privatise in the long-term . The crown prince had slowly wrestled control over business regulations from the hands of Bahrain 's government bureaucracy headed by his long-time rival , Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa , an uncle of the king who has governed the Gulf island kingdom since its independence four decades ago . One example of the rivalry between the two is Bahrain 's airport that was effectively run by the ministry of transportation , previously headed by a son of Sheikh Khalifa . It was transferred to private sector management in 2010 after years of resistance by the government administration . Transportation was a cornerstone of the crown prince 's strategy to turn Bahrain into a business hub hosting the regional headquarters of multinationals . After hardliners said that Iran and Shi'ite movement Hezbollah sponsored the unrest , they forced Gulf Air to suspend its flights to destinations in Iran , Lebanon and Iraq . `` International investors will take note of these things , -LRB- Sheikh Salman -RRB- was seen as an economic reformer . Now they will ask what is happening to the forces who pushed for privatisation and economic reforms , '' said Sfakianakis . Sheikh Nasser now appears in favor , and in recent weeks he has represented the royal family at social occasions and led a campaign for loyalists to demonstrate their allegiance to the royal family . `` It is definitely noticeable that Sheikh Nasser has become more prominent , '' said Jane Kinninmont , an analyst at British thinktank Chatham House . `` This puts him up there with the senior people , which has not been seen before . '' Also gaining influence is Sheikh Khalifa bin Ahmed al-Khalifa , the head of Bahrain 's defense forces , who is thought to be driving the crackdown on the Shi'ite opposition , and his brother , who heads the royal court . These factions are thought to have more favor with Bahrain 's Saudi backers , who are wary of Shi'ite political activity as a channel for Iranian influence , and keen to insulate the Gulf from mass protests that toppled regimes in Egypt and Tunisia . -LRB- Reporting by Frederik Richter ; Editing by Reed Stevenson and Angus MacSwan -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "304", "dct": "2011-05-09", "dates": ["2011-05-09", "2011-05-09", "2011-05-09", "2011-01-01", "2011-05-09", "2012-02-01", "2012-03-01", "2011-05-09", "2011-05-09", "2011-05-06", "2011-05-09", "2011-05-09", "2011-05-05", "2011-05-06"], "text": "TRIPOLI | Mon May 9 , 2011 11:29 pm BST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - NATO planes pounded Libyan government targets Monday but stalemate in the rebel war to unseat Muammar Gaddafi has presented Western powers with a dilemma over whether to offer covert aid to the rebel cause . Rebels said that four times during the day NATO bombed government weapons depots around 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- southeast of Zintan , a town in the Western Mountains region where conflict is escalating . `` The site has some 72 underground hangars made of reinforced concrete . We do n't know how many were destroyed . But each time the aircraft struck we heard multiple explosions , '' a rebel spokesman who gave his name as Abdulrahman said in an email . He said the planes also struck around Tamina and Chantine , east of Misrata , where besieged rebels are clinging on in the last city they control in western Libya . A ferocious assault from Tripoli has left hundreds dead during weeks of fighting . Two months into a conflict linked to this year 's uprisings in other Arab countries , rebels hold Benghazi and towns in the east while the government controls the capital and other cities . The government says most Libyans support Gaddafi , the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants , and NATO 's intervention is an act of colonial aggression by Western powers seeking to steal the country 's oil . Libyan state television reinforced that view , saying NATO warships bombed `` military and civilian targets '' in Misrata and in the adjacent town of Zlitan Monday . The military deadlock confronts allies including the United States , Britain and France with a choice over whether to exploit loopholes in the sanctions regime they engineered in February and March to help the rebels , analysts and U.N. diplomats said . Another alternative would be to circumvent the sanctions secretly but both courses risk angering Russia and China who wield vetoes on the U.N. Security Council and are increasingly critical of NATO 's operation to protect civilians in Libya . `` The problem for the West is that several key players on the council now feel that the authority they granted was abused and they 're not inclined to help the West extricate itself , '' said David Bosco of American University in Washington . The rebels face a government with superior firepower and resources but they achieved a financial breakthrough Monday , selling oil worth $ 100 million paid for through a Qatari bank in U.S. dollars , a member of their oil-and-gas support group said . Given the rebels ' failure to achieve their primary target of unseating Gaddafi , the war increasingly is focussed on Misrata , Zintan and a Libyan border crossing near the Tunisian town of Dehiba . Two rebel spokesmen in Misrata spoke of intense fighting in the city and at its strategically important airport . `` There is fighting also near the airport . The revolutionaries control the western side while the -LRB- government -RRB- brigades are still holding the southeastern side of the airport . NATO struck today in the areas of Tamina and Chantine , east of the city , '' Reda told Reuters by telephone . Rebels are trying to extinguish fires at a fuel storage depot bombarded by the government Friday . The attack created fuel shortages , rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said . A ship chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross arrived in Misrata , bringing medical supplies , spare parts to repair water and electrical systems and baby food . The war has killed thousands and caused extensive suffering , not least for tens of thousands of economic migrants from sub-Saharan Africa forced to flee overland or by boat . Dozens have died trying to reach Italy and the migration creates not only the possibility of a humanitarian crisis but also poses a political headache for NATO and the European Union . Traumatised migrants told the International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- they saw a boat carrying hundreds of people founder off the Libyan coast last week , the IOM said Monday . The migrants who reached Italy 's Lampedusa island , a collection point , also said Libyan soldiers drove them onto another vessel in what IOM officials said Monday was the first known forced evacuation from Libya in the conflict . The sinking boat was seen between Thursday and Friday last week just off Tripoli , the Libyan capital controlled by forces loyal to Mummar Gaddafi . It had been carrying 500 to 600 people , the IOM said , citing the migrants it had interviewed . They saw bodies washed ashore in Libya and it was not clear how many survived . One Somali woman managed to swim to land and board another vessel , but she lost her four-month-old baby who had been with her , the agency said . `` She was in a state of shock when she arrived on Lampedusa , '' Daria Storia of the IOM said . -LRB- Reporting by Joseph Nasr in Berlin , Matt Robinson in Dehiba , Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers , David Brunnstrom in Brussels , Amena Bakr in Abu Dhabi , Louis Charbonneau in New York and Sami Aboudi in Cairo ; Writing by Matthew Bigg ; Editing by Michael Roddy -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "102", "dct": "2011-05-10", "dates": ["2011-05-10", "2011-05-10", "2011-05-10", "2011-05-10"], "text": "-LRB- Repeats to clarify gasoline in headline .

Gasoline prices RBc1 jumped by more than 2 percent in New York on Tuesday as traders speculated that the massive flooding from heavy spring rains and snow melt could disrupt refineries on southern stretches of the Mississippi in the next two weeks . The refineries threatened by the flooding account for 14 percent of U.S. refined gasoline capacity . Pump prices in the United States already have topped $ 4 a gallon in many states , stretching consumer budgets . The floods threatened to postpone or cancel planting of rice on 300,000 acres in Arkansas , amounting to 10 percent of the total rice acreage in the United States , the world 's third-largest exporter of the grain . While only about 1 percent of agricultural land planted with major crops in the United States has been affected , the loss comes on top of dwindling U.S. grain stockpiles , weather woes in other agricultural exporting nations and rising demand , all of which have sent grain prices up steeply .

There was no immediate confirmation from Syrian officials . One diplomat told Reuters that an `` Asian group meeting will have to be called to confirm these changes . '' Another Western diplomat told Reuters that Syria 's withdrawal and Kuwait 's candidacy is `` great news . '' The 192-nation U.N. General Assembly will hold its annual elections for one third of the seats on the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on May 20 . The council is the main U.N. body charged with monitoring member states ' compliance with international human rights norms . Critics say it spends too much time bashing Israel while ignoring violations by countries like Sri Lanka , Bahrain , China , Russia and others . The original slate of Syria , India , Indonesia and the Philippines had been endorsed by Asia 's U.N. voting group and the Arab League . But Syria 's violent crackdown against anti-government protesters prompted some Western , Arab and Asian U.N. member states to suggest that Damascus should not be on the rights body when it was facing accusations of gross violations , Western envoys said . `` It is not really the time for Syria to become a member of the council of human rights , '' French U.N.

Activists from inside and outside Syria said a fragmented opposition had failed to build on street demonstrations which broke out seven weeks ago demanding greater freedoms , missing a fleeting opportunity to press for reforms from the Baath party led by the Assad family for the past four decades . `` The forces on the ground can not topple the regime ... They have lost a golden and rare opportunity to do something , '' said Abdul Karim-Rihawi , head of the Human Rights League in Damascus . `` The protests will continue but will not grow in popularity , '' he said , adding that Assad might deploy even greater force to crush them if necessary . Under the rule of Assad 's father , Hafez , Syrian forces razed the old quarter of the city of Hama in 1982 to end an uprising led by the Muslim Brotherhood . Up to 30,000 people were killed . `` If , God forbid , the regime crushes the protests then I think it will take us 50 years before we move again , '' said another Syrian activist who lives in exile . Analysts say that the unrest may not topple Assad but has definitely shaken his rule . Bouthaina Shaaban , an adviser to Assad , said earlier this week that the government had gained the upper hand over the revolt and that Assad 's rule had passed its `` dangerous moment '' . The downbeat comments from some activists , which contrast with statements from others who say Assad 's use of force will only increase protesters ' determination , reflect frustration at the inability to rally the same numbers as the Egyptian uprising which toppled Hosni Mubarak , or to agree a political manifesto . The opposition includes secularists , Islamists and ethnic Kurds , in exile and in Syria . Some seek Assad 's downfall and others want more freedoms and reform of the autocratic system . That has made it difficult to unify demands on the back of protests driven more by street anger than activists ' agendas . `` The opposition has failed to even form a council to lead and guide the protesters . This has left each city on its own and now is being crushed . They finished Deraa and now Banias and Homs then will move to another one , '' the exile activist said . Rihawi said so far no more than 200,000 Syrians had taken to the streets , from a population of 20 million . As well as Assad 's use of force , some activists said fears of chaos if Assad were to be toppled and concerns that some protesters were driven by sectarian motives could have dissuaded some people from demonstrating . `` We are now convinced that there are Islamists working from within the protesters . They are only 5 percent but they are causing damage , '' one secular activist said . `` We want democracy in Syria , but not a democracy to unleash sectarianism . '' Syrian authorities have blamed Sunni Muslim Islamist groups for the unrest , which so far has claimed the lives of more than 600 civilians and 120 soldiers and policemen . Citing chants by some crowds against Assad 's minority Alawite sect , as well as against Syria 's Christian community , another activist said : `` It is clear now that they have Islamist background . '' Alawites , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , and Christians fear their freedoms of religion would end if Sunni Islamists came to power in place of Assad 's secular Baath party . `` I am a Sunni , but I do not want the hardliners to rule us , '' said one of the activists , adding that some Sunni mosques had urged a `` greater Jihad '' , an Islamist rallying call . Syria , which opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq that toppled fellow Baathist Saddam Hussein in 2003 , turned a blind eye to Islamist militants using its land to cross into Iraq to fight U.S. forces in the years that followed the war . Some of these violent Islamists stayed in Syria , activists noted . `` My fear is that they gave the regime the motive to use force , '' one of the opposition organizers said . Activists said the country 's nightmare would be a split within the army , whose top commanders are mainly from the Alawite minority . That could unleash sectarian tension and push the majority Sunni country into sectarian conflict similar to neighboring Lebanon 's 1975-90 civil war , or to Iraq 's turmoil . `` A division in the army definitely means that Syria will be divided ... because a split on a sectarian basis means each sect will be fighting for survival , '' said a rights activist in Syria . Reports have surfaced of some low-level defections within the army , but officials and some activists dismissed it . Assad 's initial response to the protests included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds and lifting a 48-year-old state of emergency . But as demonstrations continued , he turned to the army two weeks ago to crush resistance . `` There are many people in the street who believe that Bashar is a reformist and now the protests are delaying him from achieving the reforms , '' Rihawi said , adding that Assad still retained popularity . Other activists said that even though he could deploy overwhelming force , the 45-year-old president would still have to frame a political answer to the country 's crisis : `` The security solution is not in the interest of the regime , '' one said . `` They have to resort to a political solution -- the result of the security solution is zero '' .

AD , the UAE energy firm , faces delayed payments of $ 148 million for gas from the Egyptian government which could have an impact on its future investments in the country , Dana 's CEO told Reuters on Thursday . `` We have a four to five months delayed payments from the Egyptian government which is an amount of $ 148 million , '' Ahmed al-Arbeed told Reuters in a telephone interview . Dana Gas has significant investments in Egypt and said it produced 4.25 million barrels of oil equivalent -LRB- BoE -RRB- in the country during the first-quarter of this year . `` If the payment is not made , this might make us think twice before reinvesting in Egypt but for now we are in talks with the government and we hope the issue will be resolved soon , '' said al-Arbeed . He said it was too early to say if the company might consider stopping further investments in Egypt . Dana has significant operations in the UAE , Iraq and Egypt . Dana Gas posted a near three-fold rise in first-quarter net profit on Thursday due to higher prices and increased production , helping it beat analysts ' forecasts . The Gulf 's only listed natural gas company , posted first-quarter earnings of 92 million dirhams -LRB- $ 25.05 million -RRB- , compared with 33 million dirhams for the year-ago period , it said in a statement on the Abu Dhabi bourse . Five analysts on average had expected Dana to post a net profit of 57 million dirhams for the first quarter according to a Reuters poll . -LRB- ID : nLDE739091 -RRB- But some analysts expect that ballooning receivables -- money owed to Dana by its customers -- could pressure earnings . `` While the shares may still outperform today on the headline numbers , the earnings do not fully reflect the reality of the company 's operating environment , '' said a research note from Nomura in Dubai . Dana 's price target was cut by 10 percent by research firm AlembicHC in April , which warned that receivables at the gas company were expected to balloon in the short term as the Egyptian government deferred payments . -LRB- ID : nL3E7FB1AO -RRB- Dana said first-quarter profit excluded an unrealised gain of 326 million dirhams on its investment in Hungary 's MOL MOLB . Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas formed a consortium with Austria 's OMV -LRB- OMVV .

Higher oil prices and increased production helped boost Dana 's first quarter profit . `` I would say that 60 percent of the profit comes from production and the remaining is due to the high oil price , '' he said , adding that the plan is to increase overall production by 25 percent by the end of the year . Oil and gas production for the quarter rose to 6 million BoE , compared with 4.5 million BoE in the year-ago period . Revenue rose 50 percent to 616 million dirhams .

From 2012 , any country that wants to export wood to the European Union will have to be able to prove it was not logged illegally , a regulation that has spurred a spate of deals with timber producing nations to better police their forests . The latest to enter into such so-called Voluntary Partnership Agreements -LRB- VPA -RRB- on forest management were Indonesia last week and Liberia on Monday , a move the poor West African state hopes will help revive its logging industry . They follow similar deals with Ghana , Cameroon and Congo Republic last year . For Liberia -- a country which despite being tiny hosts about half of West Africa 's remaining virgin rainforest and many of its threatened species , according to the European Forest Institute -LRB- EFI -RRB- -- the deal comes amid a surge in demand for Liberian timber after many years of hardly any . CEOs of timber companies now regularly fly down to its jungles from European capitals to make big purchases . `` Some timber here in Liberia which is very much in demand , so I came down to select them personally , '' said the CEO of Abex Bois Exotiques Pierrer Piequet at a timber field in the forest near the port of Buchanan , as workers loaded logs onto a truck . The United Nations imposed sanctions on Liberian timber amid allegations former President Charles Taylor was using the industry to fund wars in the region . The ban was lifted in 2006 but logging has been slow to pick up since . The buzz of chainsaws and crunch of bulldozers on branches echoes through the hot , humid forests of Liberia 's River Cess country , in a concession operated by local firm Tree and Tree , one of four logging companies with Liberian licenses . `` We get many buyers coming here mainly from Europe and Asia . There are species such as the Niagon , which is in high demand in Europe , '' the company 's assistant operations manager George Duo told Reuters at the site . Liberia still retains 45 percent of its original primary forest , substantially more than other countries in the region , but it also urgently needs development and jobs , after decades of war and economic stagnation . Officials hope the VPA will balance the need to sell its wood with the need to conserve its forests for future generations , which means regulating loggers . `` The coming into place of the VPA marks an end to illegal logging in the country . For too long , we 've suffered from these illegal activities , '' said Vice President Joseph N. Boakai said when he signed for the Liberian government on Monday . The VPA Agreement sets out reforms across the timber sector that will enable it to keep selling to Europe when the EU adopts its 2012 regulation on illicit timber . Liberia must monitor harvesting and shipping of wood -- and be able to show it was legally sourced to be allowed into Europe , but doing so will give it a secure export market . Local logging operators say they back the deal . `` We are happy to have a legal framework set up for the country , '' said Ricks Toweh , manager of Tree and Tree , adding that his company had helped draft the legislation . `` It is a new beginning for us . '' Timber exports once accounted for more than 20 percent of Liberia 's gross domestic product , but the sanctions stopped commercial forestry . If the VPA works , then the industry could rebound whilst still preserving West Africa 's biggest rainforest .

By Khaled Yacoub Oweis and Suleiman al-Khalidi AMMAN | Mon May 16 , 2011 7:18 pm EDT AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian villagers pulled 13 bodies from a mass grave near the southern city of Deraa on Monday , residents said , and thousands joined a night-time march in a Damascus suburb demanding the overthrow of the government . Deraa residents say hundreds of people have been missing since tanks and soldiers moved in last month to crush the cradle of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad 's 11-year rule . They said villagers digging in farmland in the outskirts of the city uncovered the decomposed bodies of Abdullah Abdul Aziz Aba Zaid , 62 , and four of his children . The villagers also found the bodies of a woman , a child and six men , all unidentified , residents said . It was not clear when they died , but Deraa residents say dozens of civilians were killed during the military assault on the city 's old quarter . Syrian and international rights groups say Syrian forces have killed at least 700 civilians across the country since the first protests broke out in Deraa on March 18 . The report on the mass grave could not be confirmed independently . Thousands of demonstrators marched through the Damascus suburb of Saqba on Monday night at the funeral of Ahmad Ataya , who died of wounds inflicted when security forces fired at a pro-democracy rally in the capital last month . A witness said the demonstrators marched at night to avoid the tough security measures that are in force during the day . It was the biggest protest in the Damascus outskirts since a security crackdown three weeks ago . Authorities have blamed most of the violence during the wave of protests on armed groups backed by Islamists and outside powers , who they say have killed more than 120 members of the security forces . Witnesses in Deraa said tanks were still positioned at main city junctions and in the outskirts , but authorities had shortened the curfew by three hours , allowing people out on the streets until 5.00 pm -LRB- 1400 GMT -RRB- . The official Syrian news agency said Assad met a delegation from Deraa and they discussed the `` positive atmosphere there as a result of cooperation between the residents and the army . '' Further north , at least 15 tanks deployed around Arida , near the border town of Tel Kelakh which troops entered on Saturday after protests erupted against Assad , and their arrival prompted dozens of families to flee into neighboring Lebanon . An activists ' protest group said at least seven civilians were killed in Tel Kelakh on Sunday when troops shelled the town and sniper fire killed one civilian on Monday , raising the death toll in the army 's assault since Saturday to 12 . The Syrian state news agency said five soldiers were killed in confrontations with armed groups in Tel Kalakh . One resident reported intermittent shelling of Tel Kelakh and bursts of machinegun fire on Monday , but the army appeared not to have advanced beyond the outskirts . `` Tel Kelakh is a ghost town . There are no doctors . Snipers are on the roof of the main hospital . Phones , water and electricity are cut , '' Mohammad al-Dandashi told Reuters from the town by satellite phone . A few families from Hilat , another border village , streamed into Lebanon on Monday as did two wounded civilians from Tel Kelakh who were seeking medical care , family members said . For the past two months Syrian soldiers and police have been trying to quell demonstrations across the country calling for Assad 's overthrow . They have tended to crack down on a flashpoint area for several days , using tank and rifle fire and mass arrests to subdue it , and then move on to another area . Troops backed by armor have now deployed in or around towns and villages across the southern Hauran plain , the central province of Homs and areas near the coast . Security forces have also tightened their grip on Damascus and its suburbs . The Lebanese army said it had sent reinforcements to the border , set up checkpoints and started intensive patrols to prevent `` infiltration activities on both sides . '' International media organizations are largely banned from Syria , making it difficult to verify accounts of events there . Assad , who trained as an ophthalmologist , has used a mixture of repression and promises of reform to stem the protests , which were inspired by uprisings across the Arab world . The United States and the European Union have imposed targeted sanctions on Syrian officials and condemned the violence used to suppress dissent . Authorities said Assad intended to launch national dialogue talks , an offer rejected by opposition leaders and the main activists ' protest group , who say security forces must first stop shooting protesters and political prisoners must be freed . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The question is how long will Obama administration will give Assad , I think until we have a civil war and it 's getting close because there is so much people can take . Syrian people thought Turkey will not allowed the killing to happen but I think we all were wrong after all , every one looking for its own interest . Syrians will remember Russia & China position real well and once the regime is gone they will be gone with it ... . This discussion is now closed .

Hijazi , who later surrendered to Israeli police who said he was being questioned , was among dozens who penetrated Israeli-held territory in a protest marking Israel 's founding , a day mourned by Palestinians as a `` nakba '' or catastrophe . Similar protests were staged across the Lebanese and Gaza borders with Israel , and deadly confrontations ensued with Israeli forces in which 13 people were killed . Many of those who broke through a fence in the Golan Heights , which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally , had already been apprehended . Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said that in addition to Hijazi who has turned himself in , three more Syrian nationals were arrested on Monday in the vicinity of Majdel Shams , the Golan Heights frontier village near where most had infiltrated . The channel said that Hijazi had gone to Jaffa in search of what had been his parents ' home before they joined the ranks of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee or be driven away during a war over the Jewish state 's founding in 1948 . He told of how after hitch-hiking in a minivan , he had also taken a public bus to the Israeli city , alongside uniformed Israeli combat soldiers . Asked about Israel 's objections to seeing Palestinian refugees and their offspring , who now number in the millions , returning to former homes , Hijazi replied : `` I imagine there are many Palestinians who do n't want to come back here , just like there are many Jews who also do n't want to stay .

Assad had been partly rehabilitated in the West over the last three years but Western powers have condemned his use of force to quell protests against his 11 years in power , killing at least 700 civilians according to rights groups . Targeting Assad personally with sanctions , which the United States and the European Union had previously avoided , is a significant slap at Damascus and raises questions about whether the West may ultimately seek Assad 's removal from power . `` The actions the administration has taken today send an unequivocal message to President Assad , the Syrian leadership and regime insiders that they will be held accountable for the ongoing violence and repression in Syria , '' Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in a written statement . A senior U.S. official said the new sanctions were meant to force Assad to carry out promised political reforms . `` President Assad has a clear choice : either to lead this transition to democracy or to leave , '' the official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told reporters . The unrest began two months ago when protesters , inspired by other Arab uprisings , called for greater freedoms and an end to corruption . The harsh crackdown on dissent by troops , security forces and irregular Assad loyalists led them to go further and demand an end to Assad 's rule . The U.S. move , announced by the Treasury Department , freezes any of the Syrian officials ' assets that are in the United States or otherwise fall within U.S. jurisdiction and generally bars U.S. individuals and companies from dealing with them . In addition to Assad , the sanctions will target Vice President Farouq al-Shara , Prime Minister Adel Safar , Interior Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Shaar , Defense Minister Ali Habib plus Abdul Fatah Qudsiya , head of Syrian military intelligence , and Mohammed Dib Zaitoun , director of the political security directorate . U.S. officials were unable to estimate the value of the assets involved , but leading Syrian opposition figure Haitham al-Maleh said the move meant `` members of the regime are now under siege . '' `` Any move by the international community may help the Syrian people in continuing their uprising , '' he told Reuters from Damascus . Switzerland said on Wednesday it would impose travel bans on 13 top Syrian officials -- but not Assad himself -- and freeze any of their assets held in Swiss banks , matching a decision by the European Union last week . Last month , Washington imposed a first round of sanctions on two relatives of Assad and the country 's intelligence agency for alleged human rights abuses . Syrian authorities blame most of the violence on armed groups backed by Islamists and outside powers who they say have killed more than 120 soldiers and police . In Syria , tanks shelled a border town for the fourth day in the latest targeted military campaign to crush demonstrations . Troops went into Tel Kelakh on Saturday , a day after a demonstration there demanded `` the overthrow of the regime , '' the slogan of revolutions that toppled Arab leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and challenged others across the Middle East . `` We 're still without water , electricity or communications , '' a resident of Tel Kelakh said by satellite phone . He said the army was storming houses and making arrests , but withdrawing from neighborhoods after the raids . In a sign that the army was coming under fire in the town , he said some families `` are resisting , preferring death to humiliation . '' A witness on the Lebanese side of the border said heavy gunfire could be heard from Tel Kelakh . Assad told a delegation from the Damascus district of Midan that security forces had made mistakes handling the protests , al Watan newspaper said on Wednesday . One delegate said Assad had told them that 4,000 police would receive training `` to prevent these excesses '' being repeated , it said . Syria has barred most international media from operating in the country , making it hard to verify reports from activists and officials . Prominent human rights lawyer Razan Zaitouna said the army and security forces had killed at least 27 civilians since moving into Tel Kelakh . The state news agency SANA quoted a military source as saying eight soldiers had been killed on Tuesday in Tel Kelakh and in southern Deraa province where protests first broke out exactly two months ago . It said five of the soldiers were killed when an `` armed terrorist group '' fired on a security forces patrol near Tel Kelakh , which is close to Lebanon 's northern border . The Tel Kelakh resident said artillery and heavy machinegun fire hit the main road to Lebanon overnight , as well as the Abraj neighborhood inhabited by minority Turkmen and Kurds . `` Most residents of Tel Kelakh have fled . Some remaining people tried to escape to Lebanon yesterday but the shelling has been too heavy , '' the resident said . `` Abraj residents have issued a call to -LRB- Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip -RRB- Erdogan to help them .

Human Rights Council after Syria , under pressure over its crackdown on protesters , dropped its bid for an Arab slot on the controversial panel . Kuwait stepped into the race last week after Western countries persuaded Arab states that Syria was not a suitable candidate . In a General Assembly vote , the Gulf emirate was elected along with India , Indonesia and the Philippines on a clean , or uncontested , slate of Asian nations for three-year council terms . Africa and Western Europe also presented clean slates but there were contested votes for Eastern Europe -- where the Czech Republic and Romania defeated Georgia -- and Latin America , where Chile and Costa Rica edged out Nicaragua . The 47-nation Human Rights Council , based in Geneva , is the main U.N. body charged with monitoring member states ' compliance with international rights norms . Critics say it spends too much time denouncing Israel while ignoring violations by Sri Lanka , Bahrain , China , Russia and other countries . Libya , elected to the council last year , is suspended because of its civil war . Syria told a closed meeting of Asian U.N. members on May 11 it had agreed to swap candidacies with Kuwait , which was set to run for the council in 2013 , and drop out of the 2011 race , diplomats said . Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari denied at the time that the decision was connected with events in his country , where troops and tanks have killed hundreds of anti-government demonstrators in recent weeks . He said the move was based on `` reconsidering our priorities '' and Syria would run for the council in 2013 . Even though Syria was not standing up for membership , five of the 192 countries in the General Assembly voted for it on Friday , assembly president Joseph Deiss said in announcing the results . Because the ballot was secret it was unclear who they were . Elected for the so-called `` Western European and others '' group were Austria and Italy , while Burkina Faso , Botswana , the Congo Republic and Benin were elected for Africa . Human rights groups have hailed the fact that Syria will not be elected this year but , as they have done in past years , criticized the clean slate system under which regional groups present only as many candidates as seats are available . `` Without competition for seats on the Human Rights Council , the membership standards set by the General Assembly become meaningless , '' said Peggy Hicks of New York-based Human Rights Watch . `` Manufactured slates of candidates may be easier for states , but they are bad for the council . '' Geneva-based group UN Watch said Kuwait and Congo were `` not qualified '' to be on the council . Kuwait 's `` ruling family largely sets the policy agenda and dominates political life . Formal political parties are banned , '' it said , adding that the country limits freedom of the press and assembly and has no independent judiciary . In Congo , the group said , recent elections were `` marred by irregularities , '' press freedom was limited and the judiciary was subject to corruption and political influence .

TD International is the same company Strauss-Kahn , then a private citizen , hired in 2007 to advise him on how to navigate international and Washington politics in his bid to become managing director of the International Monetary Fund . Documents filed in 2008 with the Foreign Agents Registration section of the U.S. Justice Department show that Strauss-Kahn , who is French , retained TD International as his `` U.S.-based communications resource . '' Strauss-Kahn , 62 , who was seen as a front-runner for the French presidency until his arrest , has been charged with trying to rape a hotel housekeeper in New York . He has denied the charges and his lawyer has said he will plead not guilty . A person familiar with the work TD International did for Strauss-Kahn in 2007 said his representatives consulted the firm informally after his arrest last Saturday and asked for advice related to his predicament . If the firm at some point becomes formally involved in his defense , the source said , its role will be in helping other Strauss-Kahn advisors , including Paris-based public relations experts , engage in `` crisis management . '' But the source , who asked for anonymity , said the firm had not been formally engaged . A lawyer for Strauss-Kahn did not respond to a request for comment . A spokesman for TD International told Reuters on Friday : `` We do n't comment on client relationships and activities . However , our past work with Dominique Strauss-Kahn is accurately reflected in -LRB- Justice Department -RRB- filings . '' A contract between TD International and Strauss-Kahn , dated July 18 , 2007 , shows he hired the firm to `` conduct a specific public relations campaign '' and `` work is to begin immediately and continue until ascendancy of client to head of IMF . '' The contract says Strauss-Kahn was to pay the firm 20,000 euros -LRB- 17,448 British pounds -RRB- , then equivalent to about $ 27,600 . According to the source , TD International helped advise Strauss-Kahn on U.S. and international political manoeuvring related to the choice of a new IMF chief . The global lender has always been headed by a western European but the former French finance minister 's bid for the post was being challenged by Russia and a group of developing nations , who were strongly pushing their own candidates . In addition to advising Strauss-Kahn on political matters , TD International introduced him to journalists from media such as the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times . The 2007 contract was signed on TD International 's behalf by Ronald Slimp , who the firm 's website says was a former U.S. diplomat and trade negotiator . The website describes the firm 's founder , William Green , as a former diplomat who is fluent in French and `` participated in the management of the Anglo-American and U.S.-Canadian intelligence relationships when posted to Washington . '' The website identifies two other partners in the firm as former CIA officers . Justice Department filings show TD International was also registered as the U.S. representative of Yulia Tymoshenko , a leader of the `` Orange Revolution '' in Ukraine and a one-time prime minister . A 2007 press release posted on the firm 's website says it was the `` registered representative of Ms. Tymoshenko 's political party .

The shockwave from the strikes was so powerful that plaster fell from the ceilings in a hotel where foreign reporters were staying , about 2 km from Gaddafi 's compound . A NATO official said the strikes hit a military facility that had been used to launch attacks on civilians . Government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said late on Tuesday that the death toll from the attacks was 19 , against an early estimate of three . Earlier the Libyan government said that 150 had been wounded , and that the casualties were local residents . `` It is definitely , in terms of one target , the largest and most concentrated attack we have done to date , '' said the NATO official in Brussels . Ibrahim said the strikes had targeted a compound of the Popular Guards , an armed unit . But he said the compound had been emptied of people and `` useful material '' in anticipation of an attack . `` This is another night of bombing and killing by NATO , '' Ibrahim told reporters . Libyan news agency Jana said targets hit by NATO included a Tripoli mosque called Nuri Bani , though this could not be independently verified . A Libyan military source said NATO forces also struck civilian and military targets in the Tajoura area , east of the Libyan capital Tripoli , and another nearby location on Tuesday . State television al-Jamahiriya said the attack resulted in `` material losses and human casualties '' but gave no specific details . It was not immediately possible to verify the report . Libyan television also reported a NATO strike on the town of Zlitan , west of Misrata , but gave no details on casualties . Led by France , Britain and the United States , NATO warplanes have been bombing Libya since the United Nations authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi forces in the country 's civil war . Critics argue that NATO has overstepped its mandate and is trying directly to engineer Gaddafi 's fall . Rebels , however , have complained Western forces are not doing enough to break Gaddafi 's army . `` We have degraded his war machine and prevented a humanitarian catastrophe , '' U.S. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron wrote in the Times newspaper . `` And we will continue to enforce the U.N. resolutions with our allies until they are completely complied with . '' Gaddafi denies his forces target civilians and describes the rebels as criminals and religious extremists . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a London news conference on Monday : `` We do believe that time is working against Gaddafi , that he can not re-establish control over the country . '' She said the opposition had organised a legitimate and credible interim council that was committed to democracy . `` Their military forces are improving and when Gaddafi inevitably leaves , a new Libya stands ready to move forward , '' she said . `` We have a lot of confidence in what our joint efforts are producing . '' The United States bolstered the credentials of the rebel National Transitional Council as a potential government-in-waiting on Tuesday when a senior U.S. envoy invited it to set up a representative office in Washington . Unlike France , Italy and Qatar , the United States has not established formal diplomatic ties with the rebels . Rebels trying to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule control the east of the oil-producing country , but the conflict has been deadlocked for weeks . French officials said on Monday that France and Britain would deploy attack helicopters , a step aimed at targeting Gaddafi 's forces more precisely . Seeking to counter fears in Western capitals that NATO could be sucked into a long-drawn-out conflict , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told the French parliament the mission in Libya `` would not last longer than a few months . '' But the use of helicopters carries risks for NATO , as they would fly lower than warplanes and be more exposed to ground fire . The downing of helicopters , and any attempts to rescue the crews , could suck Western governments into the ground war which they had promised to avoid . British Armed Forces Minister Nick Harvey said Britain had not taking a decision on deploying helicopters . `` It is an option which we are considering and at some point in the future we may get to the point of deciding to go down this route , '' he said . Reporters , whose movements are tightly controlled by the Libyan authorities , were taken to visit Tripoli 's central hospital after the heavy night raids . They were shown the corpses of three men with head injuries , their bodies laid out on gurneys . A man who identified himself only as Hatim , who had deep gashes and abrasions on his arms and legs , said the blasts had caved in part of his residence near the military compound . `` We were in the house and then , wham , the ceiling came down , right on me , '' he said . A Reuters reporter in the city of Misrata , 200 km east of the Libyan capital , said the western district of Defniyah had come under light shelling from pro-Gaddafi forces , but this had stopped later in the day . Rebel fighters in the city , the biggest rebel stronghold in western Libya , have pushed back government forces to the outskirts after weeks of street-by-street fighting . Gaddafi 's grip on power appeared to have suffered a blow last week when Libyan rebels and officials in neighbouring Tunisia said that Shokri Ghanem , Libya 's most senior oil official , had fled the country and defected . However , sources at Western oil firms said Ghanem was still working for the Libyan government , and was in fact on a secret mission to maintain ties with foreign energy firms so they could later return if international sanctions are lifted .

The Syrian and Iranian-backed ally said he believed Assad was serious about making reforms , in response to pro-democracy protests that have gripped the country for nine weeks and which have presented the gravest challenge to Assad 's 11-year rule . `` All indications and information until now still affirm that the majority of the Syrian people support this regime and have faith in President Bashar al-Assad and are betting on his steps toward reforms , '' Nasrallah said in his first comments on Syria since protests broke out in March . Iran 's Revolutionary Guards set up Hezbollah in 1982 to fight Israeli forces that had invaded Lebanon . The group enjoys strong political and military support from Tehran and Damascus . The United States lists the group as a terrorist organization . `` I personally believe ... based on discussions and directly listening to President Bashar al-Assad that he believes in reforms and is serious and committed ... and is ready to take very big steps toward reforms , '' he told a crowd in the southern Lebanese town of Nabi Sheet by video link , on the 11th anniversary of Israel 's withdrawal from south Lebanon . Syrian protesters , inspired by popular uprisings in other parts of the Arab world , initially took to the streets to call for greater freedoms and an end to corruption . Assad made some gestures toward reforms , including lifting a hated decades-old emergency law , while also sending in tanks to crush revolts in flashpoints across the country . Met with a violent crackdown by Syrian security forces -- human rights group Sawasiah says at least 1,100 civilians have been killed -- demonstrators have demanded Assad 's overthrow . Nasrallah , who had praised popular uprisings that overthrew the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt earlier this year , said the fall of the Syrian government would serve American and Israeli interests since it would be replaced by a regime `` ready to sign any peace , meaning surrender , with Israel . '' Nasrallah praised Assad 's strong support for the guerrilla group and said he preserved the unity of Lebanon . Syria 's role in Lebanon has long been in a contentious issue in Lebanese politics . Syria ended a 29-year military presence in its smaller neighbor after an international outcry over the assassination of former statesman Rafik al-Hariri in 2005 . Nasrallah , whose guerrilla fighters fought Israel in an inconclusive war in 2006 , called on Syrians to `` choose the path of dialogue and not confrontation . '' Human rights activists and witnesses say Syrian security forces , the army and irregular Assad loyalists , have opened fire on peaceful protesters . Syrian authorities blame the violence on armed groups backed by Islamists and outside powers .

More than 40 people have been killed since Monday in a part of northern Sanaa where fighters loyal to powerful tribal leader Sadiq al-Ahmar have been attacking and trying to take over government buildings including the Interior Ministry . A Reuters correspondent was woken after midnight by the latest blasts . `` The explosions can be heard across town in the south of Sanaa . This seems to be heavier weapons than the machineguns and the mortars of the past few days , '' one resident said . Each side blamed the other for the violence , which the opposition said could start a civil war . Citizens were fleeing the capital to escape the fighting in the Hasaba area of Sanaa , which erupted a day after Saleh pulled out for the third time from a Gulf Arab-brokered deal for him to step down and make way for a national unity government . Pressure has been mounting since February , when protesters inspired by revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt began camping in squares and marching in hundreds of thousands in towns across the Arabian Peninsula 's poorest state to call for Saleh to go . Saleh 's attempts to stop the protests by force have resulted in hundreds of deaths . Saleh , a wily political survivor , said on Wednesday he would make no more concessions to those seeking his departure . But the capital of the country of 23 million has begun to feel like a city at war . Fighters in civilian clothes roamed some districts on Wednesday and machinegun fire rang out sporadically . Electricity was intermittent and Sanaa 's airport was closed . Many city-center streets were deserted in the afternoon , but for government checkpoints . Long lines of cars snaked out of the city , bags piled high on their roofs , even as gunmen blocked entrances to prevent tribesmen from bringing in reinforcements , witnesses said . `` It 's no longer possible to stay in Sanaa . The confrontations will reach all parts of the city , '' said Murad Abdullah as he left by car . `` I am afraid for my life . I will go to my village in Ibb . The situation there is safe . '' Witnesses and officials said supporters of Ahmar , head of the Hashed tribal federation to which Saleh 's Sanhan tribe also belongs , controlled several ministry buildings near Ahmar 's compound including the trade and tourism ministries , as well as the offices of the state news agency Saba . Ahmar 's fighters also attacked the main building of the Interior Ministry , whose courtyard came under fire from rocket-propelled grenades , witnesses said . Televised images of Ahmar 's own compound showed tribesmen rushing through opulent but dusty halls , their floors spattered with blood , as they helped colleagues wounded in the fighting . Saleh told a group of invited reporters including a Reuters correspondent on Wednesday that his government was `` steadfast . '' `` We are bearing the shocks of what happened from the sons of al-Ahmar : the chaos and the attacks on state institutions , the press and the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Interior . This is a provocative act to drag us into a civil war ... `` We are contacting some people to talk to them and persuade them to stop trying to storm the Interior Ministry and opening fire at the ministry in order to avoid widening the conflict . '' Saba said four civilians had been killed and 11 injured in Wednesday 's fighting . Saleh 's about-turn on Sunday , after loyalist gunmen trapped Western and Arab diplomats in the United Arab Emirates embassy for hours , appeared to have sparked a major reaction . General Ali al-Mohsen , a regional army commander who has sided with protesters , called on the armed forces to defy Saleh . `` Beware of following this madman who is thirsty for more bloodshed , '' Mohsen said in a statement . `` I think there 's a real risk that violence can escalate , and we see a move toward low-intensity civil war , '' said Shadi Hamid , analyst at the Brookings Doha Center . `` There 's a real loss of faith in the political process after Saleh refused to sign a deal several times . That really cast doubt on whether Saleh has any real commitment to letting go of power voluntarily . '' Saleh said the deal remained on the table , despite his repeated failure to sign : `` I am ready to sign within a national dialogue and a clear mechanism . If the mechanism is sound , we will sign the transition of power deal and we will give up power ... `` No more concessions after today , '' he said . The United States and Saudi Arabia , both targets of foiled attacks by a wing of al Qaeda based in Yemen , have tried to defuse the crisis and avert any spread of anarchy that could give the global militant network more room to operate . U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon 's spokesman Martin Nesirky said Ban was deeply troubled by the clashes in Sanaa and called for further peace efforts and an immediate end to the fighting , while Britain reiterated calls on Saleh to sign the exit deal .

But Libyan rebels quickly rejected the offer , saying Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's government was only trying to win reprieve from NATO air strikes . The proposal by Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali Al-Mahmoudi , who said it mirrored a plan floated by the African Union , one of Tripoli 's few allies , for resolving the conflict , came on the heels peace overtures to Spain and other foreign countries . It also follows some of the heaviest attacks to date in NATO 's Libyan air campaign , which Gaddafi 's government says has exceeded a mandate of civilian protection based on United Nations Security Council resolutions , and now aims at killing or toppling the Libyan leader . `` Libya is serious about a cease-fire , which must be a cease-fire from all sides , especially NATO , '' Mahmudi told reporters in Tripoli . He dismissed , however , any prospect of Gaddafi 's departure -- a key rebel demand . `` Muammar Gaddafi is the leader of the Libyan people ; he decides what the Libyan people think , '' Baghdadi said . `` He is in the hearts of the Libyan people . If he departs , then so do all the Libyan people . '' Libyan rebel spokesman Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said the rebels do not trust Gaddafi or his prime minister . `` By talking about a cease-fire , he just wants NATO to stop its strikes on its communications centres , '' Ghoga said in comments broadcast on Dubai-based Al Arabiyah television . White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes , speaking at the Group of Eight summit in France , also said the United States did not see the new Libyan cease-fire offer as credible because it was not accompanied by action . Libya was not complying with U.N. demands and its forces were still attacking population centres , so the United States would continue with the military campaign , he told reporters . The prime minister scorned the rebel Transitional National Council , recognized by a handful of states as Libya 's legitimate representative , as former members of the same order they aim to overthrow . `` Now they absolve themselves of everything . Who was responsible for the security file ? They were , and now they are on the other side , calling on NATO to do the job for them , '' he said . But he said the door was open for talk with the rebels nonetheless . `` We are ready to speak with popular groups that represent all of Libya , anyone in that framework we welcome , whether he is in the council or not . All Libyans are welcome at the roundtable to talk . '' His remarks came as Spain confirmed it had received an offer of an immediate cease-fire from him . He declined to elaborate on that offer , or others Spain said Libya had made , and called for a fixed date to implement a cease fire . Gaddafi , who Libya says NATO is trying to assassinate , was alive and well , Mahmudi said . `` He 's in good health , handling his duties , in fine condition and he has no restrictions on his movements Libyans know he 's fine , '' he said . `` When we need him , we contact him or he contacts us . We ask about his health .

Activists complain of delays in putting Mubarak , his family and members of his ousted regime on trial and that the army has not restored order quickly enough to the country of 80 million . Egyptians are also demanding an end to endemic graft , one of the main grievances that drove thousands of protesters onto the streets in the uprising that began on January 25 . `` After some 1,000 martyrs ... people do not see any change , '' said Mustafa Ali Menshawi , a 38-year-old accountant , who was helping marshal crowds flooding into the square . `` The only change we see is that the Mubarak metro station has been changed to the Martyrs station , '' he said . In a move seen as aimed at appeasing protesters , authorities on Tuesday ordered Mubarak to stand trial on charges of graft and `` pre-meditated killing '' of protesters during the uprising that ousted him on February 11 . If convicted , Mubarak could face the death penalty . He has been detained at a hospital in the tourist Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh since April when he was reported to have suffered heart problems during an initial questioning . Hundreds staged a protest in front of the hospital calling for his departure . They said his presence was driving tourists away , according to state TV . FLAGS , PLACARDS AND NO SOLDIERS The ruling military council withdrew the army from near the protests in Cairo and has ordered security forces to stay away . Tahrir Square was decked with Egyptian flags and placards demanding that officials who worked under Mubarak and squandered state funds be investigated . `` We want to dissolve all local councils that are famous for being the most and worst corrupt institutions during Mubarak 's regime , '' said Mohammed Adel , of the April 6 Youth group . `` We also ask that all political powers get involved in the drafting of important political laws , '' Adel added . Thousands of Egyptians also took to the streets in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and in the Suez Canal 's cities of Suez and Ismailia . Smaller protests also took place in northern Sinai and in the city of Port Said on the Suez Canal . However , some Egyptians expressed opposition to the protests , saying military rulers needed time to sort things out . A few hundred gathered in Cairo 's al-Hussein area to express support for Egypt 's military rulers , chanting : `` For the sake of our country , we want to be ruled by the army . '' Some political parties , including Egypt 's powerful Muslim Brotherhood , said no protests were needed and warned they could lead to confrontations between the army and demonstrators . The absence of the Brotherhood angered some protesters , some of whom chanted : `` Where is the Brotherhood ?

After a mission involving several U.N. agencies to Misrata , WHO media officer Tarik Jasarevic said medical records had been lost or moved during the fighting , so he could give only estimated figures . `` What our team found is that from six operating hospitals , there were on average 12 deaths and 70 injuries per day during the fighting , '' he said . `` These numbers have been going down in the last week . '' He warned further deaths could be caused by a lack of specialist medical staff and drugs , including antibiotics , which raises the threat of drug-resistant infection , especially in intensive care units . Misrata is the biggest rebel stronghold in the west of the country and has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in Libya 's three-month-old conflict . Rebels have pushed Gaddafi 's forces out of the center of the city but are still attacking from positions on the outskirts . -LRB- Reporting by Barbara Lewis ; Editing by Janet Lawrence -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "328", "dct": "2011-05-29", "dates": ["2011-05-29", "2011-05-29", "2011-05-29", "2011-05-29", "2011-04-01", "1960-10-01", "1966-01-01", "1961-04-01", "1967-05-01", "1970-01-01", "1975-07-01", "1976-02-01", "1979-10-01", "1983-01-01", "1985-08-01", "1993-06-01", "1998-06-01", "1999-02-01", "2003-05-01", "2007-04-01", "2010-02-01", "2010-05-01", "2010-10-01", "2011-01-01", "2012-04-01", "2011-03-01", "2012-04-01", "2011-04-01", "2011-04-16", "2011-05-01", "2011-05-29"], "text": "Sun May 29 , 2011 1:56 am BST May 29 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan begins his first full term as head of state on Sunday after last month 's elections in Africa 's most populous nation .

In a rare display of public anger , ethnic Mongolians took to the streets early last week in protest over the hit-and-run death of a herder , killed when struck by a coal truck in China 's biggest coal producing region . The government of the huge northern region , increasingly dominated by ethnic Han Chinese , told agencies to address safety and environmental concerns related to the mining industry , Xinhua news agency reported . `` All relevant departments , enterprises and local governments must promptly report and resolve injuries and accidents that occur in mining areas and transportation links , which have caused serious problems and reactions from the people , '' Xinhua said , citing a statement from Friday but without making a direct reference to the protests . The government announced earlier the arrest of two Han Chinese for homicide over the coal truck incident , but that failed to quell the anger . Inner Mongolia is China 's biggest coal producing region and the protests come as severe power shortages loom ahead of the summer peak energy season . But infrastructure is poor and the race by truck drivers , drawn by high margins , to transport coal to the country 's east has been accompanied by a spate of accidents . In an unusual sign of defiance , hundreds of ethnic Mongolians , who make up less than 20 percent of the roughly 24 million population of Inner Mongolia , have protested in other parts of the province in recent days . Authorities last week sealed off parts of the region and dispatched paramilitary police and others in riot gear to patrol Xinhua Square in the capital , Hohhot , after calls for protests spread online . On Monday , main gates at Inner Mongolia University in Hohhot were closed and small groups of paramilitary police carrying batons stood guard in the streets , though students entered through smaller side gates . `` The university is under lockdown today . It 's to prevent any disturbances , '' said one student . Xinhua Square remained cordoned off with paramilitary police posted every few metres and large groups of police in the square and surrounding streets . Residents in the city appeared to carry on as normal . Police pulled two Reuters reporters out of a car by the square and told them not to conduct interviews . `` Today there is a special situation , '' said one . `` You have to leave . '' The heavy security appeared to be effective . `` We have n't received any information about any protests there , '' said Enghebatu Togochog of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Centre , though he added difficult communications made it hard to get up-to-date information . `` Security is exceptionally tight . The authorities appear to be sending text messages to people warning them not to leave their homes . '' Uprisings across the Arab world have made Chinese authorities jittery about any sign of instability . In a meeting on Monday that was chaired by Chinese President Hu Jintao , the Politburo , the nation 's top ruling body , said `` elements that can cause disharmony '' should be reduced by `` the largest degree . '' `` As the situation changes , our country 's concept of social management , institutional mechanisms , laws and policies ... are still unsuitable in many places , '' Xinhua reported the Politburo as saying . `` Resolving the problems in social management is urgent and requires long-term effort . '' Searches for the words `` Inner Mongolia '' on China 's most popular microblogging site , Weibo , appeared to have been blocked on Monday , returning the message : `` According to relevant laws , the search query can not be displayed . '' Resentment of ethnic majority Han Chinese by ethnic Mongolians goes back decades . Inner Mongolia was the first autonomous region set up by the Communist Party and was meant to serve as a model for Tibet and Xinjiang in offering a high degree of self-government . But a flood of migration by Han Chinese in the years following the 1949 revolution has rapidly diluted the Mongolian population . Ethnic Mongolian herders have complained that their traditional grazing lands have been ruined by mining and desertification , and that the government has tried to force them to settle in permanent houses . In Ulan Bator , capital of the independent country of Mongolia , about 50 protesters gathered in support of their ethnic cousins in China . Some held banners calling for an end to `` oppression '' and justice for the herder killed by the truck . Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch said from Hong Kong rising tension had the Party worried that instability could spread to other ethnic groups . `` The situation points to the wholesale failure of the Party 's policies towards ethnic minorities -- that they are alienating and disenfranchising each to the point that they are willing to protest even when they know the consequences can be severe , '' Bequelin said .

SANAA | Tue May 31 , 2011 4:45 pm EDT SANAA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Street fighting raged in Yemen 's capital on Tuesday ending a tenuous ceasefire between tribal groups and forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh and edging the impoverished Arab state closer to civil war . Global powers have been pressing Saleh to sign a Gulf-mediated deal to hand over power to stem spreading chaos in Yemen , a haven for al Qaeda militants and neighbor to the world 's biggest oil exporter , Saudi Arabia . The turmoil was a factor in keeping up oil prices on Tuesday , traders said . `` The ceasefire agreement has ended , '' a government official said , adding that tribesmen had seized a state building . On Tuesday , there were three main flashpoints in the troubled country -- fighting in the capital , government troops gunning down protesters in Taiz in the south and a battle with al Qaeda and Islamic militants in the coastal city of Zinjibar . U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay said 50 people may have been killed by government forces since Sunday in Taiz . Explosions rocked a northern district of Sanaa on Tuesday that houses the headquarters of an army division headed by Ali Mohsen , an influential general who has joined the opposition . `` I think it is the first time missiles are being used in the street battles , '' a resident said , referring to the loud blasts . Al Arabiya reported that government forces were bombarding Mohsen 's unit , but the Defense Ministry denied it . State television said tribesmen were again attacking government buildings , some of which they had evacuated under the truce . The report could not be independently verified . A government spokesman earlier suggested breakaway army units had attacked the ruling party 's headquarters in Sanaa . `` What was new in today 's clashes is the use of armored vehicles ... which the Ahmar -LRB- tribesmen -RRB- do n't have , '' Abdu al-Janadi , a deputy information minister , told Reuters . Sporadic fighting with tribesmen continued in the nearby Hasaba district , where residents took refuge in basements . Battles in the capital overnight ended a truce between Saleh 's forces and tribesmen brokered at the weekend after more than 115 people were killed last week . Saleh has defied calls from global leaders , elements in his own military and tens of thousands of protesters to end his 33-year-rule , which has brought Yemen close to financial ruin . He has also exasperated his rich Gulf Arab neighbors by three times agreeing to step down , only to pull out of a power transition plan at the last minute and cling on to power . The opposition coalition issued a statement calling on Gulf states to withdraw their peace plan and `` stand with the Yemeni people and its peaceful revolution . '' The breakaway military accused Saleh of starting a civil war and vowed that he and his entourage would be brought to justice . Mohammed al-Surmi , a doctor at a Sanaa hospital , said two dead and 17 wounded were brought in . The Defense Ministry website said one officer and one civilian were killed , and 13 soldiers were wounded in the fighting with tribesmen . Full casualty figures were not immediately available due to the intensity of the fighting . `` Three different dynamics are playing out at the same time , '' said Ginny Hill , who runs the Yemen Forum at the influential Chatham House think-tank in London . The newest element is the street revolution while the power struggle among the elites and fragmentation of the Arabian Peninsula country have been playing out for some time , she said . `` Saleh 's departure could be seen as the beginning of a contested and potentially lengthy process , '' she said . Saleh 's forces fired on hundreds of protesters in Taiz , about 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- south of the capital , who were trying to gather at the focal point of rallies dubbed `` Freedom Square , '' witnesses and a Reuters cameraman in the city said . At least three people were killed and scores wounded in the latest fighting there , medical sources said . U.N. 's Pillay denounced the killings in Taiz where troops used bulldozers and bullets to crack down on protesters . `` Such reprehensible acts of violence and indiscriminate attacks on unarmed civilians by armed security officers must stop immediately , '' Pillay said in an Internet posting . French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero condemned the attacks in Taiz . He also said there was no news on three French aid workers who disappeared in southern Yemen on Saturday . Paris believes they were kidnapped . Further south , government troops and locals have been trying to oust al Qaeda and Islamist militants from Zinjibar after they seized the town of 20,000 at the weekend . Residents said bodies were strewn on the streets , the national bank building was burned and explosions rocked the city . Most of the inhabitants have fled . `` Explosions lit the sky , '' one resident said . The United States and Saudi Arabia , both targets of attacks by Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , are worried that a spreading state of anarchy is emboldening the group . Opposition leaders have accused Saleh of deliberately allowing Zinjibar , located near a sea lane where about 3 million barrels of oil pass daily , to fall to al Qaeda to try to show how chaotic Yemen would be without him . At least 320 people have been killed since protests started about four months ago , inspired by popular uprisings that ended the reign of the long-standing rulers of Tunisia and Egypt . -LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf in Aden , Khaled al-Mahdi in Taiz , John Irish in Paris , Mahmoud Habboush , Nour Merza , and Sara Anabtawi in Dubai ; writing by Jon Herskovitz and Firouz Sedarat in Dubai ; editing by Mark Heinrich and Lin Noueihed -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "186", "dct": "2011-05-31", "dates": ["2011-05-31", "2011-05-31", "2011-05-31", "1982-01-01", "2011-05-31", "2011-03-01", "2011-05-31", "1963-01-01", "2011-05-31", "2011-05-29", "2000-01-01", "1982-01-01", "1967-01-01"], "text": "BEIRUT | Tue May 31 , 2011 6:50 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad issued a general amnesty on Tuesday , state television said , after ten weeks of protests against his 11-year rule and a military crackdown which has drawn international condemnation . The amnesty covers `` all members of political movements , including the Muslim Brotherhood , '' it said . Membership of the Brotherhood , which led an armed uprising against Assad 's father in 1982 , is punishable by death in Syria . Assad 's move was the latest in a series of reforms -- including lifting a 48-year state of emergency and granting citizenship to stateless Kurds in eastern Syria -- aimed at addressing the grievances of protesters . But those steps have been accompanied by a ruthless military crackdown in which rights campaigners say 1,000 civilians have been killed and more than 10,000 people arrested . Khalaf Ali Khalaf , an organizer of a Syrian opposition conference taking place in Turkey , said the amnesty `` comes too late to appease the street , like vague and halfhearted promises for reform that preceded it . '' Asked about the promised amnesty , the United States said Assad needed to take concrete action . `` He has talked reform but we have seen very little in the way of action ... he needs to take steps -- concrete steps , not rhetoric -- to address what is going on in the country , '' U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . Activists said at least five people were killed on Tuesday when tanks shelled the central town of Rastan and security forces stormed Hirak , a town in the southern Hauran Plain where the uprising first broke out in mid-March . Syria blames the violence on armed groups , Islamists and foreign agitators , saying more than 120 police and soldiers have been killed in the unrest nationwide . The official SANA news agency said two soldiers were killed in an operation to arrest `` armed terrorist groups '' in Rastan . It quoted a military source saying army and security forces seized weapons and ammunition in Rastan and killed or injured `` a number of armed terrorists . '' The United States , which has called Assad 's repression of protests `` barbaric , and the European Union , have announced sanctions against the president and senior Syrian officials . Western nations have also been pushing for the United Nations Security Council to condemn the violent repression in Syria , but veto-wielding council members Russia and China have both expressed reservations over a draft resolution . `` The Chinese government supports Syria 's efforts to protect its sovereignty and stability and we hope that stability and order in Syria will be restored as soon as possible , '' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news briefing . `` In the current circumstances , we believe that the adoption of the U.N. Security Council resolution would do no good for the easing of tensions and stability in Syria . '' The U.N. children 's agency UNICEF called on Syria to investigate reports of `` horrific acts '' of violence against children detained during the current wave of unrest . In a statement , UNICEF said use of live ammunition against demonstrators had reportedly killed at least 30 children , although it said it could not independently confirm that figure or the circumstances of their death . Syrian television said on Tuesday the Interior Minister Mohammad al-Shaar had launched an investigation into the killing of Hamza Khatib , a 13-year-old boy who activists say died after being tortured in detention . Footage of his bruised and bloodied body has been widely disseminated on the Internet . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the report showed a collapse of Assad 's will to listen to his people . `` President Assad has a choice , and every day that goes by the choice is made by default . He has not called an end to the violence against his own people , and he has not engaged seriously in any kind of reform efforts , '' she said . `` Every day that goes by the position of the government becomes less tenable and the demands of the Syrian people for change only grow stronger . '' One of the main demands of protesters has been the release of political prisoners , as well as curbing the all-powerful security forces and ending corruption . The ruling Baath Party has banned opposition and curbed political freedoms since 1963 . Protests have spread across the country , although the two main cities of Damascus and Aleppo , where security forces are heavily deployed , have yet to witness major sustained protests . The central province of Homs , north of Damascus , has seen some of the biggest demonstrations and is the latest focus of the military campaign to crush dissent . Tuesday 's violence brings to 16 the number of civilians killed since troops and tanks surrounded towns and villages in the Homs region on Sunday , according to tallies by activists . Officials say six members of the security forces have been killed in the same operation . Assad assumed power when his father , Hafez al-Assad , died in 2000 after three decades of rule . The elder Assad crushed an armed Muslim Brotherhood uprising in Hama in 1982 , flattening part of the old city and killing many thousands . The younger Assad has reinforced his father 's close ties with Iran and its support for militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas , while holding intermittent peace talks with Israel which seized the Golan Heights from Syria in a 1967 war .

Clearnet may not be best placed for the job . Members of the LME , the world 's leading industrial metals futures exchange , currently pay for the task to be done by Europe 's largest independent clearing house , LCH . They said they LME 's proposal still lacked detail and poses questions about the potential cost and security , given a changing regulatory landscape . The LME statement expressed concern that given LCH . Clearnet 's diminishing exchange portfolio it was focussing on a growing market in over-the-counter derivatives clearing , to the detriment of the exchanges for which it currently clears . In an emailed response , LCH . Clearnet said , `` Market participants tell us they are looking for proven , efficient and consolidated clearing offerings . Clearnet is best placed to continue to deliver this . '' The London Metal Exchange said earlier this month that it was considering building its own clearing system , which it believes would add to earnings . It said on Tuesday the results of a feasibility survey that began in August 2010 should be ready `` in the coming months . '' Market participants are taking a wait-and-see approach as the LME 's proposal given a lack of detail . They say they can see the potential for added cost but not yet for return . Exchange members said they were concerned about contributing to a number of default funds , as well a potential loss of margin offsets and capital requirements as European regulators get tougher on over the counter trade . A default fund is the capital held by a clearing house in case one of its members defaults . Market sources also raised concerns about a new entrant to the clearing landscape just as the sector could be ripe for consolidation . Clearnet confirmed on Saturday it has received offers from exchange operators interested in pursuing some form of business tie-up but said talks were still at an early stage . `` There is no doubt the LME could provide a clearing house . The question is does the world want that ? '' said an executive at a category one member of the exchange . `` It 's going to depend on what people think about the market evolution . '' `` My view is that it is more difficult to see that people will want more clearing houses rather than less ... In an ideal world you would have one clearing house that gives you the maximum netting and the minimum amount you need to put up . '' In its statement the LME said : `` The LME executive has been concerned that the decisions by ICE , NYSE Liffe and the LSE to self-clear would undermine LCH . Clearnet 's viability as a clearing house for exchanges . '' It also suggested that the clearing house has engaged in competitive practices that are not in the LME 's best interests by launching independently cleared products in steel . A new clearing house would aim to maintain existing clearing fees and revenue models so members would receive the same rate of return on margins and defaults , said the exchange . `` It is a matter of record that LCH . Clearnet collects some 10 million pounds annually in direct fees for clearing LME trades , '' the LME said . `` Modelling ... indicates that treasury revenue from members ' margin funds brings LCH . Clearnet a further return that is a multiple of the clearing fee income . '' Treasury revenue , partially paid back to members , is essentially the return from cash posted as collateral . The exchange also said work on establishing the size of any potential default fund has not begun . `` Would we be happy with that clearing house ? Until you see how that is going to be set up , what the capital layer is , what the default fund is , what the insurance layer is , what the cascade is , you ca n't tell , '' the executive said . The LME said it has not made a final decision on how it would finance a new clearing house but that expects little problem in raising debt finance . It also said it would consider a rights issue if there was sufficient shareholder appetite . -LRB- Reporting by Melanie Burton and Susan Thomas , editing by William Hardy -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "221", "dct": "2011-06-01", "dates": ["2011-06-01", "2011-06-01", "2011-06-01", "2011-05-01", "2011-01-01", "2005-01-01", "1975-01-01", "1990-01-01", "1948-01-01", "2011-05-29", "1967-01-01", "2012-03-01", "2011-05-27", "2011-05-28", "2006-01-01", "2010-08-01", "2006-01-01"], "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Jun 1 , 2011 1:21 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Months of political paralysis and a crisis in neighboring Syria have harmed Lebanon 's security , a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday , days after a bomb attack wounded six U.N. peacekeepers . Special Coordinator for Lebanon Michael Williams said the attack , which followed the kidnapping of seven Estonians and a deadly incident last month on the Israeli border , was part of an `` eroding and deteriorating '' security situation . Lebanon has been without a proper functioning government since January when the Syrian - and Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its political allies brought down the government of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri , who has Western and Saudi support . Efforts to form a government have made little progress and the 10-week unrest in Syria has escalated tensions . Damascus ended a prolonged military presence in 2005 , but remains a powerful player in a country still defined by the political and religious faultlines which fueled its 1975-1990 civil war . `` We see signs of the security situation deteriorating in general , and disturbingly that the institutions of the state are not responding in the way that they should , '' Williams told Reuters at his U.N. office in the hills above Beirut . He said the main concern was a political vacuum caused by the lack of government . Although Lebanese are accustomed to protracted wrangling over new cabinets , the current impasse was unusually fraught and likely to drag on for months , he said . `` The risk is greater now . One , because of the absence of a government . Two , because of the crisis in Syria . And three , because there is some fragility now along the Blue Line -LRB- U.N.-mapped frontier with Israel -RRB- . '' The Israeli army fired on a demonstration at the Lebanese border village of Maroun al-Ras two weeks ago , killing 11 Palestinians marking the `` catastrophe '' 63 years ago of the founding of Israel , security sources said . Similar protests may take place on Sunday 's anniversary of the 1967 war when Israel seized the Golan Heights and West Bank . Seven Estonians are still missing after being seized in Lebanon 's Bekaa Valley after crossing the border from Syria in March , in a kidnapping which Williams and EU envoy Angelina Eichorst described as a dark reminder of Lebanon 's civil war . In another sign of fraying authority , rival security forces came close to confrontation last week in a standoff at a state-owned telecoms firm when caretaker Telecommunications Minister Charbel Nahhas was denied access to the building . `` It is another indication of the deterioration in the security situation and the inability of state institutions to manage , '' Williams said . The political standoff and security fears also threaten Lebanon 's economy , with growth projections trimmed , tourism revenues expected to fall , and no progress on Lebanon 's plans to explore for oil and gas in the Mediterranean . `` I frankly find it distressing and troubling that the country is losing opportunities now . It 's obvious that the economic situation is deteriorating , '' Williams said . Friday 's bombing of the Italian peacekeepers , one of whom remains `` in a very grave condition , '' was the first such attack in three years on UNIFIL . `` We do n't see the attack in isolation , '' Williams said . `` Although it is the first on UNIFIL in a very long time we see the attack in the present security context . '' Expressing concern and surprise at Saturday 's announcement that Italy -- which has the largest UNIFIL troop contingent -- will cut its peacekeeping force to 1,100 from 1,780 , Williams said he would travel to Rome next week for talks . UNIFIL was expanded to about 12,000 troops and naval personnel under a U.N. Security Council resolution which halted the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon . It operates alongside 15,000 Lebanese army troops who are deployed to keep the peace and prevent weapons transfers in an area which is a stronghold of Hezbollah guerrillas .

Since the outbreak of unrest 11 weeks ago , the Syrian president has combined violent repression with efforts to appease demonstrators , a pattern repeated again this week . On the day he declared an amnesty for political prisoners , activists said security forces killed dozens of civilians in the central town of Rastan , which had seen protests against Assad . Tuesday 's amnesty was followed by steps toward a `` national dialogue '' to address popular grievances , while a dozen more people were reported killed in the military assault on the town . Whether the mixed messages are a deliberate strategy or a rushed reaction to Syria 's turmoil , analysts say they risk undermining the argument made by Assad supporters that the only alternative to his rule is civil strife . `` Syria 's minorities , middle classes and business establishment -- all three basically fear the alternatives to Assad and were initially receptive to the regime 's message of ` Us or Chaos ' , '' said a Damascus-based analyst . `` But the regime has been very inconsistent on all fronts : repression , reform , handling the economic fallout , as well as in terms of dialogue . It 's been arresting people at the very moment when it needs interlocutors on the ground . '' `` So the formulation of `` us or chaos '' is gradually turning against it , '' said the analyst , who declined to be named . Rights groups say 1,000 civilians have been killed in the unrest , which has seen protests sweep from the southern city of Deraa to the Mediterranean coast and eastern Kurdish regions . But protests have been most intense in poorer , rural areas while the capital Damascus and second city Aleppo , with wealthier businesses and middle classes , have seen less disturbance , partly because of heavy security . Authorities blame the violence on armed groups , Islamists and foreign agitators and say more than 120 police and soldiers have been killed . Most international media are prevented from operating in Syria , making it impossible to verify accounts from activists and authorities . While the demonstrations show no sign yet of reaching the scale needed to overthrow Bashar , they have continued to spread and analysts say protesters ' anger is growing . The death of 13-year-old Hamza al-Khatib focused local and international fury at perceived brutality in Syria . Activists say he was tortured horrifically in captivity , a charge denied by authorities who say he died in crossfire at a protest . People in the southern towns of Dael and Deraa held posters of the young boy on Friday , witnesses said . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said this week his death symbolized the `` total collapse '' of any effort to address peoples ' grievances and that Assad 's legitimacy had `` nearly run out . '' Despite Clinton 's condemnation , and the fact that the protests have lasted far longer than uprisings which toppled Arab leaders in Tunisia and Egypt , the United States appears reluctant to make a clear call for Assad to go . That reluctance stems partly from uncertainty over who might take over in Syria , a mainly Sunni Muslim country ruled for 41 years by Assad 's minority Alawite sect . Under Assad and his father , Syria has been allied to Iran and backed militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas , but also held peace talks with Israel . A meeting of Syrian opposition figures in Turkey this week called for Assad to step down to pave the way for democracy , but gave little indication of how it might govern in his place . `` Although the regime may be losing ground with the silent majority , the opposition are not gaining anything because they are not answering any of the key questions that the crisis raises , '' the Damascus-based analyst said . `` In a state which is so fragile , how do you ensure successful transition ? What is these people 's agenda ? They are focused on the issue of toppling the regime and they have been completely absent on key issues which people want answers on . '' As the protests and crackdown continue -- a Syrian human rights group said 27 people were shot dead at a protest in the city of Hama on Friday -- there have been increasing reports of protesters responding with force . Analysts say that protest marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful but that since the start of the unrest there were isolated cases of protesters taking up arms in Deraa , Tel Kelakh on the Lebanese border and most recently in Rastan . `` For the first time there have been real clashes and people are fighting back , '' said Rime Allaf , Associate Fellow in Chatham House . `` It is drastic that it is coming to this ... -LRB- though -RRB- it 's not widespread yet . '' A senior Western diplomat in Beirut said Lebanese politicians , allies and foes of Damascus alike , believed `` the situation in Syria is irreversible : `` Nothing like this has happened in modern Syrian history . The regime is extraordinarily vulnerable . '' Resistance from Russia and China has so far obstructed U.S. and European efforts for a United Nations resolution condemning Syria 's crackdown , and Assad has emerged once before from a period of Western isolation . But he has seen two regional allies , Turkey and Qatar , distance themselves from his government in recent weeks , and Syria 's economy will suffer as tourism revenues dry up , investments are put on hold and sanctions against senior officials deter some international firms from doing business . '' -LRB- Assad 's rule -RRB- is not disintegrating , '' Allaf said . `` But this notion that little bits of so-called reform can be given and things will get back to normal , this is not going to happen .

A blast in March on the pipeline , suspected to have been carried out by angry tribesmen , has stopped the flow of light Marib crude , which has forced the 130,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- Aden refinery to shut and hurt fuel supplies . `` There has been no flow of crude and no Marib output . The fuel shortages are worsening , especially in Sanaa , '' a Yemen-based shipping source said . `` Yes they 're importing , but not enough as they do n't have the money for it , and you ca n't find a lot of people these days to sell to them , trade with them . '' Trade sources said that repairs and testing of the pipeline would take around two weeks from when the work begins . `` When that will be remains unknown and depends on the willingness of tribes to allow it to happen , '' one source said . Yemenis celebrated on Monday what many hoped will be a new era without President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who is now recuperating in Saudi Arabia after an operation to remove shrapnel from his chest a day earlier . The future remains uncertain for Yemen , home to an al Qaeda wing aiming to exploit a potential power vacuum in a nation near vital global oil transport links and torn by complex rivalries among tribal leaders , generals and politicians . Yemen produced a total of around 260,000 bpd of crude oil in 2010 . Around 110,000 bpd of that is light crude , which is in short supply globally after Libyan output came to a virtual standstill due to a revolt there . In recent weeks Yemen has tried to boost fuel imports to make up for the closure of the Aden refinery . `` There are several vessels due -- two in the next coming days for diesel to be used in power stations , -LRB- and -RRB- at least one cargo of gasoline . But the thing is they 're running out of fuel very quickly , '' the shipping source said . A trade source said fuel shortages have meant fuel prices have soared , with a 20-litre container of petrol in bigger cities such as Aden costing 1,500 rials -LRB- $ 7.01 -RRB- and much higher at around 7,000 rials in more remote areas . `` People are buying fuel where they can and taking it to other areas where supplies are more scarce , '' the source said . While Yemen 's light Marib crude output has been shut since mid-March , heavier Masila crude output and exports have so far been unaffected . Any descent into chaos in Yemen , the Arab world 's poorest country , which lies next to oil giant Saudi Arabia and major shipping lanes , would alarm Gulf neighbors and Western powers worried about al Qaeda .

IMF mission chief to Iceland Julie Kozack told a conference call with reporters the authorities ' commitment to strong policies should enable the economy to stay on the course of recovery . The IMF approved a $ 225 million -LRB- 137 million pounds -RRB- loan disbursement for Iceland on Friday as it nears the end of a $ 2.1 billion IMF program agreed in 2008 after its top banks collapsed , forcing it to seek financial aid from the IMF and Nordic partners . `` The authorities ' strategy strikes the right balance between moving cautiously and not eroding any of the gains made so far which could undermine confidence , '' Kozack said . She said it was up to Iceland 's government to decide whether it wants a follow-up IMF loan program . Kozack said it was important that Iceland return to the markets as quickly as possible , although the fund does not have a specific timeline in mind for when that should happen . `` The sooner Iceland can return to markets the better , '' Kozack said , adding : `` It -LRB- would be -RRB- a very strong signal of a normalization of Iceland 's relationship with international capital markets and that is an important signal . '' In a sign of its recovery , Iceland has begun meeting with investors about a possible Eurobond as it prepares its first international sale of bonds since its economic meltdown . Kozack said Iceland 's credit default swap spreads have been at post-crisis lows of around 210 basis points , which `` gives us some comfort that Iceland may be able to issue -LRB- debt -RRB- at reasonable rates . '' Debt crises in Ireland , Greece and Portugal have pushed up borrowing rates . The latest IMF review was delayed due to a nationwide referendum in which Icelandic voters rejected a revised $ 5 billion repayment plan for Britain and the Netherlands for money lost in a Landsbanki Icesave accounts during the financial crisis . The dispute will now be decided through legal channels . An IMF report released on Monday said a better-than-expected asset recovery of Landsbanki estate `` provides comfort that public finances will remain on a sustainable path even if Iceland is found to have a sovereign obligation in the Icesave dispute '' . Kozack said the IMF was initially concerned that the uncertainty around the unresolved Icesave dispute could affect investment plans and hurt economic growth in Iceland . However , she said 2011 investment projects remain well financed and have not been affected by the Icesave dispute . `` We have not revised our investment projections down and we are still confident investment will continue going forward , and that growth will be investment led , '' she added . -LRB- Reporting by Lesley Wroughton ; Editing by James Dalgleish -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "248", "dct": "2011-06-06", "dates": ["2011-02-09", "2011-06-06", "2011-06-06", "2011-06-03", "2011-06-06", "2011-06-06", "2011-01-01"], "text": "Yemen 's President Ali Abdullah Saleh -LRB- L -RRB- and Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi smile at the Presidential Palace in Sanaa February 9 , 2011 . LONDON | Mon Jun 6 , 2011 4:52 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's departure to have his wounds treated in Saudi Arabia offers Yemen a precious chance to halt a slide into civil war and achieve a peaceful transition of power . Much could go wrong . Young protesters eager to add Saleh to the list of toppled Arab autocrats have greeted his exit with euphoria , but they fear a come-back by the wily leader , who was wounded along with other senior officials in an attack on his palace on Friday . Vice-President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi , now Yemen 's acting leader , was quoted by the state news agency Saba Monday as saying Saleh was recovering and would return within days . The future of Yemen is uncertain . Lying next to Saudi Arabia and vital maritime oil routes , it hosts a virulent al Qaeda wing exploiting feeble state control in an impoverished nation riven by rivalries among tribal leaders , generals and politicians . `` If Saleh remains out of the country and if his sons and nephews do n't begin instigating or taking provocative action , Yemen can avoid all-out war , '' said Yemen expert Gregory Johnsen . `` At the same time , we have come dangerously close in the last couple of weeks to what could easily be classified as a civil war , so it 's too early to say . It could go either way . '' The attitude of Saudi Arabia , which has traditionally played an equivocal role in Yemeni politics , could be decisive . `` The Saudis will seize the opportunity ... to extend his medical recovery into a political rest , '' said Yemen expert Khaled Fattah . The risk of Yemen descending into Somalia-style anarchy was `` a nightmare for Saudi national security . '' The kingdom took Saleh in for urgent hospital care on what a Saudi official termed humanitarian grounds . `` We do n't interfere in his decision -LRB- to stay or return -RRB- , '' the official said . That may be Riyadh 's public stance , but the United States and its European allies will be quietly pressing the Saudis to ensure that Saleh 's absence from Yemen becomes permanent . The Saudi cabinet said Monday that Gulf states would pursue effort to broker an agreed transfer of power . `` I do n't think the Saudis or his people want him back , '' said a Western diplomat . `` He does n't have regional support . I 'd be surprised if he came back and it 's too nice a let-out for him . '' Saleh , however , initially delayed traveling because he was seeking assurances from Saudi King Abdullah that he would be able to return after treatment , a Yemeni government source said . Saudi Arabia is Yemen 's main aid donor and has also long funded Yemeni tribes to maximize its own influence , but it has struggled to manage the crisis in its neighbor , failing to get Saleh to sign a Gulf-brokered plan for him to relinquish power . `` I 'm not sure Saudi Arabia is the infallible snake charmer that people on the outside believe it to be , '' Johnsen said . After nearly 33 years in power , Saleh has left the Arab world 's poorest nation close to chaos and economic collapse . A shaky truce has calmed Sanaa after two weeks of fighting between Saleh 's forces and a powerful tribal federation in which more than 200 people were killed and thousands forced to flee . The president may have handed over to his faceless deputy , Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi , but some of his sons and nephews remain in charge of well-equipped military and security units . They have the firepower to challenge General Mohsen Ali , a Saleh kinsman who defected to the opposition with his troops , or to take on the Hashed tribesmen who have fought Saleh loyalists . Others who will demand a say include a disparate axis of Islamist and leftist parties , as well as the youthful protesters who want a `` new Yemen '' -- a civil state ruled by democracy , not the corrupt patronage politics that stamped Saleh 's rule . `` There is no single institution or individual in Yemen who is capable of exerting control , '' said Fattah . `` Yemen 's formal structures such as political parties and government institutions are in no position to shape events . The divided military , on the other hand , is a reflection of tribal coalitions and elite struggle , not state power , '' he added . A possible roadmap for transition would involve forming a national council of tribal elders , generals , clerics and opposition politicians -- including representatives of rebels in the north and south -- as well as the emerging youth movement . The opposition coalition has endorsed the vice-president 's assumption of power as a first step in the transition , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections . For many Yemenis , the turmoil since January has compounded a struggle for survival in a land where rapid population growth has further stressed scarce water , food and other resources . `` In the very short term , the priority is demilitarization of public life , summoning all military units back to barracks and pulling tribal militia from the streets of Sanaa , '' Fattah said . Many people , including those internally displaced , may need humanitarian relief until basic services can be restored . Any new government will struggle to rescue Yemen from economic disaster or to satisfy 23 million people seeking relief from crippling poverty , corruption and failing public services . `` The top priority will be creating jobs , '' said Johnsen . `` This is going to be very difficult . The next government will really have its hands full . It will have to make very difficult decisions which will anger many portions of the population . '' Ironically , the single most effective way to reduce unemployment in Yemen , would be for Saudi Arabia and other Gulf oil producers to open their doors to Yemeni migrant workers . Johnsen said the United States and Europe could try to convince the Gulf countries fretting about instability in Yemen that this would serve their own interest , as well the West 's . `` That would be a tough sell for the Obama administration , given historic Saudi fears about letting Yemenis in .

SINGAPORE | Mon Jun 6 , 2011 6:09 am BST SINGAPORE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rolls-Royce -LRB- RR . L -RRB- is set to build a new engine to beef up the A350 jetliner being developed by Airbus in a costly rethink of strategy for Europe 's most ambitious new plane project , industry sources said on Monday . Airlines have criticized the planemaker 's one-size-fits-all policy that would see the mid-sized A350 built in three separate models all using the same engine , the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB . Until now , Airbus and Rolls have defended the engine as an all-rounder capable of powering twinjet A350 planes carrying 270 to 350 people , competing with two different types of planes manufactured by rival Boeing -LRB- BA . But the range needed from one type of engine became daunting as airlines called for more thrust for the largest A350-1000 , allowing it to fly further with more weight . `` My understanding is that Rolls-Royce has agreed to build a new engine , '' the chief executive of a major A350 customer told Reuters at an airline industry event . A spokesman for Airbus declined comment . A spokesman for Rolls-Royce in Singapore was not available for comment . A new engine typically costs up to $ 2 billion to develop , according to engine industry executives . An industry source familiar with the project told Reuters in November that Rolls was looking at two variants of the same engine , which would be less costly than building from scratch . But it remained unclear how many components would be shared between old and new models or who would pay for the upgrade . The head of a second customer airline said he was awaiting details of the changes to the A350 , but noted Airbus needed to juggle several variables to get the technical ingredients right . One of the world 's most influential aircraft buyers , leasing magnate Steven Udvar-Hazy , said he expected Airbus to modify its plans for the A350 and that this could lead to delays . `` They have to address payload , range and runway performance , '' the chief executive of Air Lease Corp -LRB- AL. . N -RRB- told Reuters . PA -RRB- last week reaffirmed plans to deliver the first A350 to be produced , the 314-seat A350-900 , in late 2013 . It did not address the delivery schedule for the other models , the 270-seat A350-800 and the 350-seat A350-1000 . Airbus last month canceled a media briefing on the A350 and said it would issue an update at the Paris Air Show in June . The aircraft has undergone numerous design changes in its history . The Trent XWB is the latest and physically largest member of the Rolls engine family which powers the world 's biggest jets . With a fan wider than Concorde 's fuselage and built to devour more than a tonne of air every second , the engine claims to be among the most powerful and flexible in civil aviation . But engines are designed to work most efficiently in a certain band of thrust and critics have said the Trent XWB would find it difficult to operate efficiently across all three types of A350 , even before the A350-1000 is beefed up . First indications of a change in strategy were disclosed by industry sources in November . The final decision could set the tone for the engine market in the next decade , with implications for the rivalry between Airbus and Boeing . Airlines say a beefed-up A350-1000 would be better able to compete with the Boeing 777 mini-jumbo , one of Boeing 's most successful models , while the smaller A350-800 and A350-900 aim to tackle the 787 Dreamliner , due to enter service this year .

But the choice of a high-profile American to head the probe has led at least one Caribbean football federation to ask Blatter to intervene . `` The investigation is tainted and biased and clearly has a U.S. driven agenda , '' a federation official wrote in a letter to FIFA seen by Reuters . The official said there were `` two America complainants , an American investigator , an investigation and an interrogation being conducted on American soil while FIFA remains a Swiss registered entity and none of the persons under investigation being U.S. citizens '' The letter asked FIFA President Sepp Blatter to replace Freeh with a `` truly independent investigator and secure a neutral venue for the interview of any Caribbean Football Union member other than the United States of America . '' Three members of the Caribbean Football Union -LRB- CFU -RRB- -- president Jack Warner and staff members Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester -- were provisionally suspended by FIFA 's ethics committee pending a full inquiry into the events surrounding a meeting in the Caribbean with Asian soccer chief Mohamed Bin Hammam . Qatari Bin Hammam , who was running against Blatter for FIFA president at the time of the meeting , has also been suspended following the bribery allegations . All four suspended officials have insisted they are innocent . The report to FIFA 's ethics committee was initiated by American Chuck Blazer , general secretary of CONCACAF , the regional body for soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean . Blazer worked with Chicago-based lawyer John Collins on the dossier and with an American now leading the investigation and the interviews to be held in Miami , Blatter has been asked to intervene . Barbadian Lisle Austin , who replaced Warner as interim president of CONCACAF , was suspended by that body 's executive committee on Friday and Honduran Alfredo Hawit was appointed to replace him . With Warner and Austin suspended , CONCACAF , which has been controlled by Trinidadian Warner and his Caribbean allies over the past two decades , has just one Caribbean representative on the executive committee .

AMMAN | Tue Jun 7 , 2011 6:31 pm EDT AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrians fled a restive town toward the Turkish border , fearing bloodshed as troops with tanks approached , under orders to hit back after the government accused armed bands there of killing scores of its security men . Though accounts of days of killing in Jisr al-Shughour ranged from an official version of gunmen ambushing troops to residents ' reports of an army mutiny , it triggered international alarm that violence may enter a new and bloodier phase after three months of popular unrest that has left over 1,000 dead . France and Britain , allies in the war against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , took a lead in pushing U.N. moves against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . But Russia , citing NATO 's inconclusive bombing of Tripoli , said it would veto intervention against Syria in the United Nations Security Council . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe , at U.N. headquarters in New York , said it was `` a question of days , maybe hours '' before the Council voted on a resolution condemning Syria . A draft circulated last month does not propose military intervention . At Jisr al-Shughour , home to tens of thousands of people , residents said they were taking cover and bracing for attacks . `` The army is taking up position around Jisr al-Shughour , '' one anti-government activist told Reuters by telephone , saying residents have seen troops approaching the northeastern town from Aleppo , Syria 's second city , and from Latakia on the coast . `` Most people have left the town because they are scared , '' he said , asking not to be named for his own safety . `` They know the deaths will be high . People have gone to nearby villages close to the Turkish border . The doctors and nurses have also left . '' On Monday , Information Minister Adnan Mahmoud said army units would carry out their `` national duty to restore security . '' The government has expelled independent journalists , making it hard to determine clearly what is happening in the country . Despite enthusiasm for pro-democracy movements that have unseated dictators in Tunisia and Egypt , few Western leaders -- let alone their autocratic Arab partners -- have shown a will to intervene in Syria , an Iranian ally whose volatile mix of ethnic and religious groups sits astride a web of regional conflicts . Assad 's family and supporters from the minority Alawite sect have dominated Syria since his late father seized power 41 years ago . He has responded with promises of reform , and a crackdown on protesters in towns across the country . His officials accuse radical Islamists of fomenting a violent , armed revolt . Neighboring countries , including Israel and Turkey , worry that a collapse into chaos could set off sectarian conflict and the emergence of violent , radical Islamists , as happened in Neighboring Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003 . But Western powers kept up pressure . British Foreign Secretary William Hague , in some of London 's strongest language yet against the 45-year-old leader , told parliament : `` President Assad is losing legitimacy and should reform or step aside . '' He said European governments were looking at further sanctions . `` We are working to persuade other countries that the Security Council has a responsibility to speak out , '' Hague added . Russia appears opposed to a general condemnation of Assad , let alone authorizing military action against him . President Barack Obama , who last month urged Assad to lead a transition to democracy or `` get out of the way , '' did not mention Syria in remarks at a news briefing on Tuesday . But in Brussels , Russia 's envoy to the European Union , Vladimir Chizhov , said : `` The prospect of a U.N. Security Council resolution that 's along the same lines as Resolution 1973 on Libya will not be supported by my country ... The use of force , as Libya shows , does not provide answers . '' Veto-holding Russia abstained on the Libya vote , allowing NATO to begin a bombing campaign that Western powers say saved civilians in rebel-held Benghazi from an onslaught by Gaddafi 's forces , but which has failed to dislodge the Libyan leader . A report that Syria 's ambassador to Paris had quit prompted speculation of rifts in the Syrian elite . France 24 television aired comments it said was the envoy resigning . But Al-Arabiya later broadcast comments in Arabic that it said were from the same diplomat in which she denied making such a statement . It remained unclear whether there had been some hoax or a change of heart . The ambassador could not be reached to comment . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . No one in the entire country , man , woman , or child has the right to even breathe without asking Assad 's regime -- starting from the bottom of the ranks all the way to the top officals , that is if he\\/she can reach such high ranking officals . This is the way of life for any Syrian , unless that is , they are affiliated with the government . This is how Assad rules the country and will continue to do so . Anyone asking for their basic right of freedom will be annihilated . Assad will even destroy and attempt to vanish from the entire earth a population of people if anyone dares to , again , ask for their freedom of right to live . This was witnessed in Hama in 1982 . Strife and violence is being instigated by Assad and his cronies in Jisr Al-Shaghour intentionally to start a war among the people . There are no armed protestors . No civilian has the right to carry a gun in Syria , unless they are part of the `` Mukhabarat '' . But , like `` awmassey '' wrote , the time has come for Bashar to leave . Unfortunately , it is at the expense of the people . The international community must do more than rhetoric . Otherwise , the entire population of Syria will be wiped out by Assad , just so he can stay in power . Assad is not a reformer . He is a butcher and murderer ! Just like his father ! There is a presumption in this article that ought to be examined : that the Middle East uprisings are '' pro-democracy '' in nature . They are in fact '' regime change '' in nature . The vast majority of people in these countries are very unhappy with their leadership and desire change . The idea that the direction of the desired change is toward Western values is almost completely unsupported on the ground and is wishful thinking on the part of people who ought to know better . Ultimately when all is said and done , we 'll have little reason to rejoice . This discussion is now closed . We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication .

'' In March , the UK government unexpectedly raised the tax rate for offshore oil and gas exploration to 32 percent from 20 percent , fuelling concerns among producers that a number of marginal fields may become unprofitable . Statoil put on hold development of two oil and gas fields off the British coast following the tax rise . Germany 's Merkel , on the other hand , says her country 's exit from nuclear power will require heavier investment in gas and coal power plants . Bjoernson said the UK 's Electricity Market Reform -LRB- EMR -RRB- proposals clearly support nuclear and renewable energy , but fail to give incentives to investors involved in the gas industry . `` That is a bit strange in times of financial austerity because that 's where the British consumer and British industry will be presented with a higher energy bill , '' he said . Statoil 's investor partners had grown reluctant to make investment decisions in the UK due to regulatory uncertainty , he added . `` We are an industry with very long lead time . We need a predictable regulatory framework . '' The EMR White Paper is expected to be presented to parliament before the summer recess , which starts in July . Statoil is the largest supplier of gas from the Norwegian Continental Shelf to the UK , with a market share of around 16-18 percent , according to company figures . UK imports of Norwegian gas have dropped in recent months as Britain has sourced additional supply from liquefied natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- tankers . Despite the decline , Bjoernson said he was confident Norwegian gas and LNG could supply Britain alongside each other . `` I think that as UK production falls there 's room for Norwegian gas and additional LNG , '' Bjoernson said .

Sverre Svenning , director with Fearnley Consultants , which is part of broker Fearnleys , said net fleet growth was forecast to reach 13 percent this year , despite a pick up in scrapping in May , versus over 16 percent in 2010 and nearly 10 percent in 2009 . `` During the course of three years , the entire dry bulk fleet will have expanded by more than 40 percent and there is no chance that demand growth can match that , '' he told a Navigate shipping conference in London . `` The freight market is expected to remain subdued for the next 18 to 24 months . We do not foresee any significant upturn before the end of 2013 . '' Ship owners went on a ship ordering spree before economic turmoil in 2008 hit the sector . It normally takes three years for a ship to hit the water from when it is ordered . `` We think this year will become a record delivery year both for capesizes and for bulk carriers in general , '' Svenning said . `` The dry bulk market has tanked , there is no doubt about it . '' Fearnleys estimated net fleet growth would reach 11 percent next year before coming off substantially in 2013 to 4 percent . '' -LRB- There will be -RRB- strong fleet growth through to 2012 before we see a more benign development in 2013 , '' he said . Svenning said there had been expectation that rates would stay soft when they hit a record low in late 2008 . `` Then the Chinese came back in the spring of 2009 and saved everybody by increasing imports of iron ore and coal , '' he said . `` After two relatively good years we see now that capesizes especially and to a certain degree panamaxes are really , really low in earnings . '' Average capesize earnings have fallen to below $ 5,000 a day this year , below operating costs estimated at $ 7,500 to $ 8,000 a day , compared with over $ 200,000 a day before the financial crisis in 2008 . They reached $ 10,937 a day on Tuesday , Baltic Exchange data showed . `` Everyone is anticipating the freight market is going to be disappointingly low for probably 12 to 24 months , '' James Leake , managing director of ICAP Shipping Research , told the conference . Iron ore and coal account for about two thirds of total seaborne trade of dry bulk volumes . Svenning said coal imports , excluding India , were down about 2 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year and dropped about 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 , which `` indicates a weaker momentum in the market '' . `` We see that coal imports are increasing still , but the effect on total demand is relatively small . '' He said iron ore imports continued to increase and had risen 12 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year , rising 6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 . `` The problem is the steel industry in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan -- they are all producing at very closely to capacity . So they do n't need any more iron ore , so again we have to look to China . '' Simon Young , chief executive of COSCO UK , a unit of China 's top shipping conglomerate -LRB- 601919 . SS -RRB- , told the conference indications were growing that throughput at China 's ports was slowing down and iron ore imports could weaken . -LRB- IDn : LDE7560PK -RRB- He said the dry freight market had experienced a `` super cycle '' boom period encouraging players to expect China to have annual growth of iron ore and coal trade of over 20 percent . `` The booming period was so long that this made everybody believe that China would never stop , '' he said . `` Nobody could guarantee for every year for the next 10 years to have a 20 or 30 percent increase .

UNITED NATIONS | Wed Jun 8 , 2011 11:47 pm BST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain , France , Germany and Portugal handed the U.N. Security Council a draft resolution on Wednesday condemning Syria 's crackdown on protesters , despite the risk of a Russian veto . The U.N. ambassadors of the four European Union countries told reporters they presented the draft at a council meeting at which the 15-nation body was briefed by a senior U.N. official on the unrest in Syria . There was no vote on the latest draft resolution , which may be amended further . British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the text had been revised to respond to developments in Syria and concerns raised by some council members . `` We hope that all members of the Security Council will be able to rally to it , '' Lyall Grant said . `` We hope that it will get overwhelming support and that we will be able to go to the vote in the next few days . '' Three months of popular unrest in Syria has cost more than 1,000 lives , according to human rights groups . French Ambassador Gerard Araud said the worsening situation made it necessary for the council to take a stand on the issue . `` Our concern is that the country could fall into a civil war , '' he said . `` The council has to act . '' Lyall Grant said negotiators would meet again to discuss the draft on Thursday morning . Several diplomats said there could be a vote on Friday . The United States , which diplomats say has been reluctant to risk a Russian veto of a U.N. condemnation that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will almost certainly ignore , is not a sponsor of the resolution . However , U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Washington had offered its `` strong support for that text . '' Russia and China , which both hold vetoes , have made clear they dislike the idea of council involvement , which they say could help to destabilize a strategic Middle Eastern country . Several diplomats told Reuters they expected Russia to veto the draft resolution , though others said they thought Moscow could be persuaded to abstain , in which case China would likely follow suit . `` I hear that the veto is inevitable , '' one diplomat said . Resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes to pass . If Russia and China abstained , the draft would be adopted , even if Lebanon , South Africa , India and Brazil voted against it . While Russia has long been an ally and key arms supplier to Syria , diplomats said the Russians made clear they did not want a repeat of the NATO intervention in Libya , which Moscow believes has spun out of control beyond the original U.N. mandate to protect civilians . Without mentioning Russia , China and India by name , Rice dismissed the comparisons with Libya . `` We heard several council members , in some instances ... disingenuously , use Libya as an excuse , as a ploy to avoid the real issues that we are facing in Syria , '' Rice said . In a challenge to Russia and Beijing , British Prime Minister David Cameron told parliament in London , `` If anyone votes against that resolution or tries to veto it , that should be on their conscience . '' Like an earlier draft first circulated to council members last month , the latest text urges countries not to supply weapons to Damascus but does not provide for an actual arms embargo or other specific punitive measures . The draft , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters , condemns `` systematic '' human rights violations by Syrian authorities and says they may amount to crimes against humanity . But it also denounces violence against security forces . One diplomat said the new amendments attempted to make the resolution look less like a prelude to further action such as the military intervention that NATO has conducted in Libya . In particular , a new clause says that `` the only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process . '' Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin gave no hints as to whether or not he planned to veto the draft resolution . `` Things are being crossed out -LRB- in the text -RRB- , '' he said as he entered the council chambers . `` I need to see a clean copy .

BEIRUT | Wed Jun 8 , 2011 7:15 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey threw open its borders to anxious Syrian refugees on Wednesday and urged their government to curb violence against civilians after thousands abandoned a town near the Turkish frontier in fear of a military assault . With Western public opinion startled by the bloodshed that has met Syrians ' efforts to emulate other Arabs in casting off autocratic rule , Britain and France asked the U.N. Security Council to condemn President Bashar al-Assad -- though there seemed to be no appetite for Libya-style military intervention . Assad 's government has accused armed bands of killing scores of its security men in the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shughour and vowed to send in the army to carry out their `` national duty to restore security '' there . Troops with tanks have deployed near the town , prompting many of its 50,000 people to flee . `` We are monitoring developments in Syria with concern , '' said Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who has long sought warm relations with Assad . `` Syria should change its attitude toward civilians and should take its attitude to a more tolerant level . `` It is out of the question for Turkey to close its doors to refugees coming from Syria . '' The troop movements , after the government reported the loss of over 120 men in what anti-Assad activists said was fighting among soldiers , has raised fears violence could move to a new level . Rights groups say over 1,100 civilians have been killed since March in protests against 41 years of Assad family rule . In Jisr al-Shughour , people have long memories of a mass killing in 1980 , under Assad 's father . That proved a precursor to the suppression of an armed Islamist revolt in the city of Hama , in which many thousands were killed in 1982 . A total of 448 people crossed into Turkey on Wednesday and were being housed in tents , state-run Anatolian news agency reported . Some 100 tents were set up in a camp near the border where 666 people are now receiving food and medical attention . Some wounded were taken to hospitals . Syrian residents have said most who fled the town remained in villages inside Syria . Reuters journalists in Turkey saw tents on the Syrian side of the border . Turkish villagers said they saw Turkish troops and ambulances pick up Syrians who crossed earlier in the day . Adding the new arrivals to earlier figures from the Turkish Foreign Ministry , some 750 Syrians have entered since March . A 16-year-old boy who fled across the border said soldiers entered Jisr al-Shughour from Friday . `` They shut the bakeries and cut the water to the town , '' said the boy who declined to give his name . `` Soldiers attacked houses and men , women and children regardless , '' he said . France and Britain , allies in the war against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , handed the U.N. Security Council a draft resolution on condemning Syria 's crackdown on protesters , despite the risk of a Russian veto . `` And if anyone votes against that resolution or tries to veto it , that should be on their conscience , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said , in a pointed reference to efforts to secure Russian backing for it . The draft resolution condemns the repression and demands humanitarian access , Cameron said in London . But it was unclear how Russia , which holds a veto , would vote . Citing NATO 's inconclusive bombing of Tripoli , Moscow says it will not back intervention against Syria in the Security Council . Western diplomats said they did not expect a vote on Wednesday but hoped it might come before the end of the week . The original draft resolution , which diplomats say has been amended only slightly since last month , urges countries not to supply weapons to Damascus but would not provide for an actual arms embargo or other specific punitive measures . One diplomat said the amendments attempted to make it look less like a prelude to further action like the military action that NATO has conducted in Libya , which Moscow has opposed . At the same time , a senior European diplomat told reporters in Washington that European Union nations are preparing a third round of sanctions against Syria that target Syrian companies . At Jisr al-Shughour , residents have said since Tuesday that they were taking cover and bracing for attacks . Rami Abdulrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a convoy of tank-carriers with 60 tanks and about a dozen trucks carrying troops were seen moving on the main Aleppo highway in the direction of Jisr al-Shughour . `` When they -LRB- troops -RRB- passed the town of Saraqeb , protesters threw stones , prompting troops to open fire , killing one person , '' Abdulrahman told Reuters . Earlier he said troops had deployed in neighboring villages , including Ariha to the east and on the main highway to the city of Latakia to the southwest . Residents said about 40 tanks and armored vehicles were about 7 km -LRB- 4 miles -RRB- from Jisr al-Shughour . Assad has expelled Reuters correspondents and barred most independent media , making it impossible to verify such accounts . A witness in Damascus told Reuters he saw 40 tanks and armored vehicles and trucks able to carry some 400 troops heading north on Tuesday toward the cities Homs and Hama . Despite enthusiasm for pro-democracy movements that have unseated presidents in Tunisia and Egypt , few Western leaders -- let alone their autocratic Arab partners -- have shown a will to intervene in Syria , an Iranian ally whose volatile mix of ethnic and religious groups sits astride a web of regional conflicts . `` Assad is finished , but we have to see how this regime will crumble , '' said Burhan Ghalyoun , a Syrian opposition and academic at the Sorbonne in Paris . Assad 's family and supporters from the minority Alawite sect have dominated Syria since his late father seized power 41 years ago . He has responded with promises of reform , and a crackdown on protesters in towns across the country . Jisr al-Shughour is home mainly to people from the Sunni Muslim majority . The security forces are mostly run by Alawites . Neighbouring countries , including Israel and Turkey , worry a collapse into chaos in Syria could set off sectarian conflict . Activists have reported incidents of soldiers who have defected from the army because they could no longer bear to open fire on protesters , but those accounts have been hard to verify . In the latest of several similar videos distributed over the Internet by anti-government activists , a man presented as a soldier from the province around Jisr al-Shughour said the protests were peaceful and called on fellow soldiers to quit .

Full Article Syrian forces kill 28 ; some troops mutiny AMMAN | Fri Jun 10 , 2011 11:51 pm IST AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian forces shot dead at least 28 at rallies after Friday prayers , activists said , and refugees described gunbattles between mutinous soldiers and other troops in recent days . The Syrian army swept into the northwestern border town of Jisr al-Shughour and began to arrest `` armed opponents '' , state television said . Thousands of civilians have fled the town into Turkey , fearing the security forces ' revenge for incidents in which 120 troops were reported killed this week . State television said that some 35 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- away , well-armed `` terrorist groups '' burned police buildings and killed members of the security forces in the town of Maaret al-Nouman . The nature of the alleged `` terrorist groups '' was unclear . Authorities have repeatedly tried to portray anti-government protesters as armed and violent . But protesters , refugees in Turkey and rights activists said some soldiers in the northwest had refused to shoot at protesters and fighting had broken out between loyalist and mutinous forces this week . `` There were peaceful protests today -LRB- in Maaret -RRB- calling for freedom and for the downfall of the regime , '' one demonstrator said by phone . `` The security forces let us protest , but when they saw the size of the demonstration grow , they opened fire to disperse us . '' `` During the protest , two officers and three soldiers refused to open fire so we carried them on our shoulders . After that , we were surprised to see helicopters firing on us . '' A 40-year-old man who had fled across the border into Turkey from Jisr al-Shughour with a bullet still in his thigh also described mutiny in Syrian ranks . `` Some of the security forces defected and there were some in the army who refused the orders of their superiors , '' he said . `` They were firing on each other . '' Human rights activists aired a YouTube video purporting to be from a Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Armoush saying he had defected with soldiers to `` join the ranks of the masses demanding freedom and democracy . `` We had sworn in the armed forces to direct our fire at the enemy and not on our own defenceless people . Our duty is to protect citizens and not to kill them , '' he said in the video , whose authenticity could not be immediately verified . Fifty-seven Syrians from Jisr al-Shughour were in hospital in Turkey , its state-run Anatolian news agency said on Friday . Ahmad Abdellatif , 27 , who lay paralysed in hospital with three bullet wounds , said Syrian military intelligence agents on rooftops had fired on him and other unarmed people who assembled in a public garden after a funeral for a protester . Abu Ata , who was shot in the back , said he had been among uniformed Red Crescent workers aiding mourners at another funeral this week when they came under fire from rooftops . `` It was a deliberate hit aimed to kill , '' he said . The northwest border area , like other protest hotspots , is prone to tension between majority Sunni Muslims and Assad 's Alawite sect , which dominates the Syrian power elite . The Jisr al-Shughour violence may hint at splits within security forces , where commanders are mainly Alawite and conscripts Sunni , that would increase the risk of Syria descending into civil war . Elsewhere in Syria tens of thousands of people marched to call for the overthrow of the president . `` Long live Syria , down with Bashar al-Assad ! '' Security forces shot dead at least two demonstrators taking part in a rally in the Qaboun district of the capital Damascus , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . Some troops fired from rooftops at marchers , activists said . Residents said government forces also killed two protesters in the village of Busra al-Harir in the southern Hauran plain and fired on thousands defying a heavy security presence in the southern city of Deraa , fount of the three-month-old revolt . `` There was a demonstration of 1,000 people when security police fired from their cars , '' a Busra al-Harir resident said , giving the names of the dead as Abdelmuttaleb al-Hariri and Adnan al-Hariri . The latter was an amputee , residents said . However , state television said unidentified gunmen killed a member of the security forces and a civilian in Busra al-Harir . Another protester was shot dead in the Mediterranean port city of Latakia , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . A Turkish newspaper said Ankara was looking into creating a buffer zone along the border as a contingency if hundreds of thousands of Syrians were drive out by the military campaign to stamp out protests against 41 years of Assad family domination . Demonstrators demanding the `` downfall of the regime '' and chanting slogans in support of compatriots in Jisr al-Shughour took to the streets in the oil-producing eastern province of Deir al-Zor , the central cities of Hama and Homs , the main Mediterranean port of Latakia and the Tabaqa region on the Euphrates River in Raqqa province , activists and residents said . Tens of thousands of people marched unchallenged in Hama , they said , well above the turnout of the previous Friday when security forces killed at least 70 protesters . Protests were also reported in five Damascus suburbs , Syria 's second largest city Aleppo and Maarat al-Numan near Jisr al-Shughour , but their size was not immediately clear . Inhabitants said at least 15,000 troops along with some 40 tanks and troop carriers had deployed near Jisr al-Shughour . `` Jisr al-Shughour is practically empty . People were not going to sit and be slaughtered like lambs , '' said one refugee who crossed on Wednesday and who gave his name as Mohammad . Residents said troops and armored vehicles heading for the town had stormed Sarmaniya village , 10 km -LRB- six miles -RRB- south of Jisr al-Shughour , and cut off the region 's communications . `` They began as usual by firing heavy machineguns into the village . But the people of Sarmaniya had mostly left . Hundreds of troops and security forces have defected in the last several days .

RED CROSS CALL FOR ACCESS The International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- urged Syria to allow its aid workers wider access to the civilian population without further delay , including people who have been wounded or detained in the military clampdown on public dissent . Rights groups say over 1,100 civilians have been killed since March in the revolt to demand more political freedoms and an end to corruption and poverty . `` Whether Assad still has the legitimacy to govern his own country , I think is a question everyone needs to consider , '' said U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday . Britain , France , Germany and Portugal have asked the U.N. Security Council to condemn Assad , although veto-wielding Russia has said it would oppose such a move as counter-productive . World powers have shown no appetite for any Libya-style military intervention in Syria because it sits on a major fault line of Middle East conflict , allied with Iran against nearby Israel . The Syrian leadership has shrugged off mild punitive sanctions imposed so far , and verbal reprimands from abroad .

But he complained that Damascus was taking the issue `` very lightly '' and Ankara could not defend its `` inhumane '' reply to the unrest .

BEIRUT | Fri Jun 10 , 2011 8:44 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fears that Syria may slide into civil war are growing after a week when the government said over 120 servicemen were killed at a town near the Turkish border . As it sent tanks on Friday into Jisr al-Shughour , a mainly Sunni Muslim town whose 50,000 inhabitants had mostly fled , the cause of last weekend 's bloodshed was still in dispute -- state media blamed unidentified gunmen but democracy activists said troops mutinied after refusing to fire on unarmed demonstrators . Whatever the truth , the killings suggest either cracks within President Bashar al-Assad 's security forces or the beginnings of an armed revolt -- or some combination of the two . Either way , the scale of the killing in an area prone to tension between Syria 's Sunni majority and Assad 's Alawite sect points to a bloodier turn of events after three months of unrest against 41 years of Alawite-dominated Assad family rule . That in turn would rock the entire Middle East , where Syria , Iran 's main Arab ally , sits at the heart of numerous conflicts . `` The country is sliding toward civil war . It is a step toward civil war , '' said Syria expert Joshua Landis , associate professor of Middle East studies at Oklahoma University . He noted that the poor area around Jisr al-Shughour , lying at the foot of the `` Alawite Mountain , '' the heartland of the dominant minority sect , was home to conservative Sunni Muslims . Many Syrians who joined the Sunni Islamist insurgency in Iraq against U.S. forces came from that region , he added . `` It 's got a history of anti-government agitations , '' Landis said . `` The Islamic currents are very strong there . '' In 1980 , the late Hafez al-Assad , who preceded his son as president , crushed a Sunni revolt in Jisr al-Shughour , which lies on a strategically important road between Syria 's second city Aleppo and the main Mediterranean port of Latakia . Two years later , Assad 's forces put down an armed uprising in Hama by the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood , killing many thousands and razing the old town -- an event which still resonates for Syrians considering challenging their rulers . Those who have taken a lead in demonstrating for reforms , inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian protests which launched the Arab Spring , stress their insistence on non-violent action . Few are willing to speak publicly about taking up arms . And some dismiss talk of sectarian and ethnic violence as scaremongering by Assad loyalists intent on keeping power . However , in conversations this week with a number of Syrian activists , several said they believed some of Assad 's opponents were already using weapons , including arms smuggled from abroad . `` Some people have taken up arms against the security forces in Jisr al-Shughour . We know that , '' said one activist who , like many , would speak on the subject only on condition of anonymity . `` The question is : Is this limited ? Or is it going to spread to other cities ? '' After years of repression , it is hard to establish the strength in Syria of organised movements like the Muslim Brotherhood , let alone of other anti-government groups . As in several other towns , residents in Jisr al-Shughour have accused Alawite militiamen , known as shabiha and fiercely loyal to the Assads , of helping the security forces . Two activists said armed Sunni men , as well as shabiha groups , had set up rival sets of checkpoints on roads -- an echo of the kind of sectarian tension familiar from neighboring Lebanon and Iraq . Guns are widely available across Syria . `` People have taken arms , '' Landis at Oklahoma University said . `` Things are about to get a lot worse than we thought . '' Louay Hussein , an activist in Damascus , said he did not know of Sunnis taking up arms in the northwest of the country . But he told Reuters from the capital : `` We have warned the authorities from the beginning that the excessive use of violence will , in the end , allow armed groups to use violence against them . '' Assad has responded to protests , which began in the southern Sunni town of Deraa , by offering discussions on reform but also by sending in security forces to detain and kill demonstrators . The government insists it is willing to listen but rejects Western pressure for radical changes . It points out Syria has a potentially volatile mix of ethnic and religious communities , including Christians and Kurds , as well as Sunnis and Alawites . `` Syria is a mosaic , '' Syrian government spokeswoman Reem Haddad told Al Jazeera this week . `` It is made of many different sects living together . '' Many in the Christian and Alawite minorities say they support reforms , but fear that calls for the overthrow of Assad could fragment the country of 20 million and hand it over to hardline Sunni Islamists who would persecute other religions . Assad 's initial response to the protests has included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds , lifting a draconian state of emergency , freeing hundreds of prisoners and calling for a national dialogue . Protests , triggered by anger and frustration at corruption , poverty and lack of freedoms , have been mainly peaceful , though rights groups say the death toll among protesters is over 1,100 . At least 200 security personnel have also been killed , the government says . Activists say that at least some of the dead soldiers were killed for disobeying orders to stop protests . Syria has expelled Reuters correspondents and barred most foreign media , preventing independent reporting from Syria . Fayez Sara , an opposition figure who was detained earlier in the uprising , said he still has hopes that a political solution might save the country from descending into chaos . `` We should try till the last minute because otherwise the price tag will be high , '' he told Reuters from Damascus . `` When we say the time has ran out for a political solution , this means we are opening the country to civil war . '' Western powers and their Arab allies have voiced concern but show no appetite for Libya-style intervention in Syria . The gravity of the situation particularly alarms some across the border in Lebanon , where officials with ties to Syria privately express concern that some areas may be headed for chaos . A Lebanese analyst , who is close to some opposition figures in Syria , said : `` We have been warning our Syrian brothers but they do not want to listen . They think the civil war in Lebanon and in Iraq will not reach them . They are wrong . '' The possibility of splits in the armed forces , where the top command ranks and elite units are largely Alawite while the mass of conscripts are Sunni , is also a concern . A Damascus based analyst , echoing many observers abroad , said Assad and his Alawite allies appeared bent on hanging to power at all costs : `` The regime has essentially vowed to break the country over the people 's heads , '' the analyst said . `` It will push the country over the cliff unless Syrian society resists its divisive tactics . So the fate of Syria lies not in the hands of the regime , but in that of the people . '' An activist who took part in an opposition conference in Turkey last week said he believed that widespread violence was a risk many were willing to take , however , to be rid of Assad . `` Even if there is ... a civil war or anything like that , people are determined to go all the way , to the end , regardless of the cost , '' he said . `` We want him out and we want to be free of this regime . `` The regime is pushing the country toward civil war and we are heading that way it seems . '' We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . That would be bad for the other Muslim sects , Kurds and the Christians . It appears to me the desire to be free is greater than a desire to embrace a Sunni based religious dictatorship . In the end , all of this might have to be settled by a civil war . If that happens , the US needs to back the moderates in the country . Otherwise , there could be big trouble in the region . Journalists are supposed to be neutral . The report reveals the reporter 's blatant bias . This reporter has an agenda . `` Guns are widely available across Syria '' . Syrians would crack up if they heard such misinformation . To get a pistol , you would have to know the right people , bribe VERY generously , and wait for months .

The use of the aircraft came on a day of nationwide rallies against President Bashar al-Assad , as unrest showed no sign of abating despite the harsh crackdown by his authoritarian state . The helicopters opened fire in a northwestern town after security forces on the ground killed five protesters , said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . `` At least five helicopters flew over Maarat al-Numaan and began firing their machineguns to disperse the tens of thousands who marched in the protest , '' one witness said by telephone . `` People hid in fields , under bridges and in their houses , but the firing continued on the mostly empty streets for hours , '' said the witness , who gave his name as Nawaf . Syria 's state television , in contrast , blamed violence in the area on anti-government groups . It made no mention of attack helicopters but said an ambulance helicopter had come under fire over Maarat from `` terrorist armed groups , '' injuring crew . Britain , France , Germany and Portugal have asked the U.N. Security Council to condemn Assad , though veto-wielding Russia has said it would oppose such a move . Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem wrote to the Security Council accusing the opposition of violence and sabotage , Al Arabiya television said . Foreign governments were basing their views on `` inaccurate information , '' it said . State television said earlier well-armed `` terrorist groups '' had burnt police buildings and killed members of the security forces in Maarat al-Numaan , which lies 55 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- south of Syria 's second city Aleppo on the highway to Damascus . Moualem 's letter asked for U.N. help to combat `` extremism and terrorism . '' Damascus wanted dialogue with the opposition , the letter said . , Syrian authorities have banned most foreign correspondents from the country and have repeatedly tried to portray anti-government protesters as armed and violent . `` There were peaceful protests today -LRB- in Maarat -RRB- calling for freedom and for the downfall of the regime , '' one demonstrator said by phone . `` The security forces let us protest , but when they saw the size of the demonstration grow , they opened fire to disperse us . '' `` During the protest , two officers and three soldiers refused to open fire so we carried them on our shoulders . After that , we were surprised to see helicopters firing on us . '' The northwest border area , like other protest hotspots , is prone to tension between majority Sunni Muslims and Assad 's Alawite sect , which dominates the Syrian power elite . The violence may reflect splits within the security forces , whose commanders are mainly Alawite and conscripts Sunni . Activists said Syrian forces had shot dead at least 33 at rallies across the country after Friday prayers . A U.N. spokesman said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had been trying to call Assad all week but was told that the president was `` not available . '' Thousands of civilians have fled from the northwestern border area into Turkey , fearing security forces ' revenge for incidents in which 120 troops were reported killed this week . Local people said at least 15,000 troops along with some 40 tanks and troop carriers had deployed near Jisr al-Shughour . `` Jisr al-Shughour is practically empty . People were not going to sit and be slaughtered like lambs , '' said one refugee who crossed the border into Turkey . A 40-year-old from Jisr al-Shughour , with a bullet still in his thigh , also described mutiny in Syrian ranks . `` Some of the security forces defected and there were some in the army who refused the orders of their superiors , '' he said . `` They were firing on each other .

In a pattern witnessed in other cities and towns besieged by troops and armor following street protests demanding political freedoms and an end to Assad 's autocratic rule , residents said loyalist forces commanded by Assad 's brother Maher pushed into Jisr al-Shughour . The strategic town , among hills on the road between Syria 's second city Aleppo and the country 's main port of Latakia , had seen large demonstrations , with residents describing a mutiny by security forces whom they said fought other troops to try and prevent the killing of civilians . `` Tanks came from the south after shelling randomly and sending volleys of machinegun fire all over the town . People are still fleeing from the north , '' one resident said . Bassam , a tile layer , fled to Turkey as troops were closing in on his hometown . He showed mobile phone camera footage of a dead man , between 18 and 25 years old , with a bullet wound in his leg , and a large exit wound in his stomach . He lay on a bloodied cloth . Another picture showed a young man who had been shot in the head . He said the two were killed just outside Jisr al-Shughour by troops under the command of Maher . `` There are only a few people left . I escaped on my motorcycle through dirt tracks in the hills , '' he said . He said troops burned wheat crops in three villages near Jisr al-Shughour in a scorched-earth policy to try to crush the will of people in the strategic hill region who have been participating in large protests against Assad 's rule . Witnesses said more than 4,000 Syrians have crossed over to Turkey and up to 10,000 had taken shelter among trees near the border since forces commanded by Maher sent tanks and troops into the northwestern province of Idlib . They said they feared revenge attacks for violence in which Syria said 120 troops were killed but which refugees and rights campaigners said resulted from soldiers mutinying following the killings of civilians . The United States accused the Syrian government of creating a `` humanitarian crisis '' and called on it to halt its offensive and allow immediate access by the International Committee for the Red Cross to help refugees , detainees and the wounded . `` When the massacre happened in Jisr al-Shughour the army split , or they started fighting each other and blamed it on us , '' a woman refugee , who refused to give her name , told Turkish news channel NTV . Other refugees said the troops killed or burned cows and sheep , adding that agricultural land around the village of Sarmaniya to the south of Jisr al-Shughour had been destroyed . The Syrian official state news agency said `` armed terrorist groups '' had burned land in Idlib province as part of a sabotage scheme . `` The Syrian people are telling Bashar al-Assad we do n't want you . God burns his heart . He has burned our land . He made us destitute , '' the woman refugee told NTV . Damascus has banned most foreign correspondents from the country , making it difficult to verify accounts of events . Turkey also has restricted access to refugees in camps and hospitals , saying it is to protect their privacy . Human rights groups say security forces have killed more than 1,100 Syrian civilians in increasingly bloody efforts to suppress demonstrations calling for Assad 's removal , political freedoms and an end to corruption and poverty . The protests were inspired by uprisings against other entrenched autocrats in the Arab world . `` I 'm deeply concerned and saddened -LRB- that -RRB- so many people have been killed in the course of peaceful demonstrations , '' U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told reporters during a visit to Colombia 's coastal city of Cartagena . `` I 've talked to President Assad several times ... he must take bold , immediate and decisive actions to listen to the people and to take necessary measures to reflect the will of the people . '' At the United Nations Russia and China snubbed Security Council talks on Saturday convened to discuss a draft resolution that would condemn Syria 's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters , U.N. diplomats said . `` Russia and China did n't think it necessary to show up , '' a council diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity . `` It 's a pretty clear message , '' another diplomat said . A senior Turkish diplomat said 4,300 Syrians had crossed the border and that Turkey was prepared for a further influx , though he declined to predict how many might come . Turkey , a Sunni country that had backed Syria 's ruling hierarchy , who belong to Syria 's minority Alawite sect , has been increasingly critical of Assad 's use of force to quell the protests as they spread to regions near the 800 km -LRB- 500 mile -RRB- long border between the two countries . In Washington , Jay Carney , President Barack Obama 's spokesman , said : `` Syrian leaders have no excuse for denying humanitarian assistance by a neutral body like the ICRC . If Syria 's leaders fail to provide this access , they will once again be showing contempt for the dignity of the Syrian people .

At a third site , set up in fields close to the border but so far still empty , workers carried beds into tents on Saturday . Radikal newspaper said Turkey would establish a buffer zone if migrant inflows from Syria exceed 10,000 . Just inside Syria , thousands more people were gathering close to the frontier , according to an activist helping coordinate the movement of refugees . `` The border area has turned practically into a buffer zone , '' said the man , who identified himself only as Abu Fadi . `` Families have taken shelter under the trees and there are 7,000 to 10,000 people here now .

'' More than 5,000 Syrian refugees have crossed the border and a U.N. refugee spokesman said the Red Crescent was preparing a fourth camp with room for 2,500 more . Witnesses said some 10,000 Syrians were sheltering near the border . The assault on Jisr al-Shughour , on a key road junction , is the latest action by armed forces to crush demands for political freedom and an end to oppression that pose an unprecedented challenge to President Bashar al-Assad 's 11-year rule . The main Syrian activist group organising protests said the crackdown had killed 1,300 civilians since February . Rights groups had previously put the toll at around 1,100 . Residents said most of Jisr al-Shughour 's 50,000 people had fled toward the Turkish border about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- away , and tanks and helicopters had been shelling and machine-gunning the town . Syria has banned most foreign correspondents , making it difficult to verify accounts of events . It says the protests are part of a violent conspiracy backed by foreign powers to sow sectarian strife . `` Units of the Syrian Arab Army have taken total control of Jisr al-Shughour and are chasing remnants of the armed terrorist gangs in the woods and mountains , '' the Syrian news agency said . It said one soldier and two armed men had been killed in clashes around the town , and that that army units had defused explosives planted on bridges and roads . The agency said the forces had uncovered mass graves containing the bodies of 10 security men killed and buried by armed groups in Jisr al-Shughour . `` Most of them had had their heads and arms amputated with machetes , '' it said . Asked if there were clashes in the town , Mustapha , a 39-year-old mason who said he had fled to near the Turkish border early on Sunday , told Reuters by phone : `` What clashes ? The army is shelling the town from tanks . Everyone has been fleeing . `` Even if we did have guns , what are they going to do in front of artillery ? Syria is a tightly controlled dictatorship and all of a sudden the regime says Jisr al-Shughour is armed to the teeth . They are punishing us for wanting freedom . '' The government said last week that `` armed gangs '' had killed more than 120 security personnel in the town after large demonstrations there . Refugees and rights groups said the dead were civilians killed by security forces or soldiers who had been shot for refusing to fire on civilians . `` When the massacre happened in Jisr al-Shughour the army split , or they started fighting each other and blamed it on us , '' a woman refugee , who refused to give her name , told the Turkish news channel NTV on Saturday . A senior Western diplomat in Damascus told Reuters : `` The official version is improbable . Most people had left Jisr al-Shughour after seeing the regime 's scorched-earth policy , shelling and the heavy use of armor in the valley ... `` The refugee exodus into Turkey is continuing and the numbers are higher than those officially counted so far . '' Residents said the army unit attacking Jisr al-Shughour was commanded by Assad 's brother Maher and employing the tactics used in other centres to crush protests . The United States accused the Syrian government of creating a `` humanitarian crisis '' and urged it to halt its offensive and allow immediate access by the International Committee for the Red Cross to help refugees , detainees and the wounded . Turkey has provided camps for refugees and sent the wounded to hospitals , but restricted access to the refugees , saying this is to protect their privacy . In footage shot for Reuters by a Turkish youth on the Syrian side of the border , a few kilometres into Syria from Guvecci , exhausted and distressed looking Syrians waited in a cluster of tents and under makeshift shelters . The West and the United Nations have criticised Syria for not allowing international access to the wounded , the imprisoned and the refugees , but Russia and China have not backed any Security Council action to rein in Syria 's rulers . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . In its brutal response , the regime appears to be equally as desperate . This at a time when the U.N. and NATO are stretched to the limit and Russia and China are unwilling to act . It will become uglier and uglier . I am sure -LRB- ha . ha -RRB- that Mr. Cameron and Mr. Sarkozsy are up at this time after a sleepless night worrying about civilian deaths in Libya , reading the news on Reuters and wondering if they are in any way responsible for the Syrian mess . But of course they are not responsible , and I am sure that they are both appalled at the unfolding of events and regret that there is nothing that they can do about the situation . The massive propaganda effort that was launched to justify the intervention in Libya will have to be doubled now and the double-speak has to be ramped up , just to keep their little heads above water . But their heads will roll -LRB- politically speaking -RRB- , because their people are now going to realize that when you debase a noble ideal -LRB- saving innocent lives -RRB- by hypocritically using it to justify military action to promote narrow self-interests , then you create a situation where no one will care when that noble ideal is invoked again by you or anybody else . Morality in politics does matter . The Syrian President and both Cameron and Sarkozsy will soon learn that lesson . They will also learn that we are now living in the 21st . century and not the 19th . This whole uprising thing is ridiculous . First off , peaceful demonstrations should focus on labor stikes , shutdowns or sitins to get message out , not guns . Government should allow approved and controlled demonstrations and only use water cannons , tear gas or stun grenades if necessary to disperse unruly demonstrators . The idea is to PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE . Unfortuately , both sides need to get a grip -LRB- on reality and move towards negotiations that lead to reform . It would seem since the USA\\/Israel has been activity trying to destabilize Syria for decades with regime change & transfer of Golan Heights officially to Israel as their goal that any reports from so called human rights activists should be suspicious unless funding NGO identified & confirmed by international recognizes independent journalist . Unrest in Syria is regional with the majority of the nation carrying on normal daily activity and supporting the Assad government . This is unlike the national popular protests of other Arab nation , and actually appears to have more in common with Ukraine s Orange Revolution 2004 than Arab Spring . In the Orange revolution activist incited young university student in Kiev to protest elections the local unrest gain western media attention which to the surprise of the rest of the country lead to regime change , which was revoked by the people in the next general election . We really need to question all reports of brutality that are n't validated by respected independent reporters least they lead to false accusation as those aired by the BBC against Gaddafi indicating the ordering of mass rape & issuing the troops Viagra to assist in the act . Stories like that are meant to build popular support for continued bombardment leading to the invasion & occupation of Libya . After USA\\/EU once again going beyond the scope of UN Security Council Resolution ; using air attacks to aid rebels & impose regime change by any means , while refusing to sanction crimes against humanity of Israel , Bahrain , Yemen & Saudi Arabia it is unlikely that the USA , Israel & France will ever get Russia & China & a majority of the Security Council to approve any action against Syria or Iran . We are now actively attacking 5 sovereign nations therefore we are currently at war with 6 nations -LRB- N. Korea is only a cease fire so technically the USA is still at war -RRB- . No wonder we have a budget deficit . It is not because of the social safety net spending but for bombs & troops to be used against nations who refuse to implement USA economic or political policy . Basically with the help of a willing press our government is making up lies , misrepresenting facts & instigating unrest to convince USA population of government brutality & human rights violation requiring USA interference . This is not new we fell for it with Iraq , Vietnam , Pakistan & Afghanistan and the media was a willing partner . Why should we accept their word concerning other proposed interventions ? Instead of continuing to play policemen of the world so the privileged & corporations can profit we need to revise requirements for military intervention . Do any of the nations we are current at war with pose a threat to USA mainland ? No !!!! That should be the only reason to attack any sovereign nation . There are international organization to apprehend criminals , if someone has broke the law a warrant should issued , laws should be followed . No more assassination squads to eliminate people without due process under any circumstance , we are suppose to be a civilized nation ruled by law not vigilantes ! Is it the responsibility of the USA taxpayers to fund the acquisition , expansion & security of USA corporate foreign assets , or to maintain Israel 's illegal border expansion from its illegal 1967 attack , invasion & occupation of its nieghbors ? If Bahrain & Saudi Arabia can use its security forces to impose order & put down rebellion by slaughtering peaceful protestors , destroy Mosques , & torture political detainees why ca n't Syria put down what appears to be an instigated rebellion bent only on regime change not betterment of conditions . The Syrian rebels were never peaceful & continually have refused attempt by the government to respond to their complaints . This speaks of a foreign backed assault to overthrow a popular government , rather than a popular protest movement to improve condition & end corruption . Until the recent unrest the Syrian government has never been accused of being an brutal authoritarian dictatorship so what has change ? Arab spring has allowed covert activist to increase their activities to incite unrest hiding under the guise of regional unrest . Regime change definitely benefits Israel once Assad is removed the handpicked purchased new government will finally sign the treaty transferring the Golan Heights to Israel . Temporarily , providing for Israel s security , until the Syrians once again take up arms against colonial occupation . . When are we going to stop the use of our taxes & military to fill the pockets of the privileged while our nation crumbles around us and the people join those of the middle east in poverty ?

Turkey 's `` zero problems with neighbors '' policy has made Ankara into a regional power and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan a hero in the Arab street . But with more than 5,000 Syrian refugees fleeing across the border to escape a crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad , the long-time NATO member and European Union-candidate is reminded of the awkward position it has put itself in trying to champion democracy while befriending the region 's autocratic leaders . Erdogan , who won a third consecutive term in Sunday 's election , has stepped up his criticism of Assad after having embraced him in recent years . `` The whole policy of warming up to Syria has collapsed , '' said Semih Idiz , a foreign policy expert for Milliyet daily . `` After the elections I expect Turkey to reevaluate its Middle East policy . It has not brought the results expected . '' Other `` Arab Spring '' uprisings have tested Turkey 's ability to look after its new interests , but Syria -- an Iranian ally with a volatile ethnic and religious mix lying in a web of regional conflicts -- poses particular challenges . While Turkey has urged Assad to implement reforms and has added its voice to growing international condemnation by calling the crackdown `` inhumane , savage repression , '' Iran has supported the Syrian regime . Ankara and Tehran , which have also forged closer ties in recent years , compete for influence in Damascus . `` The Syrian crisis has the potential to make ties between Ankara and Tehran frostier . If Iran or -LRB- Lebanon 's Shi'ite group -RRB- Hezbollah get involved in Syrian affairs Turkey will have to tell foreign powers to stay out , '' Idiz said . Meanwhile the Syrians seeking refuge in Turkey are delighted by the decision to keep the country 's doors open to them -- around 300 Syrians in the border area cheered and shouted `` Long live Erdogan '' on hearing of his election win on Sunday . Some analysts say Turkey has been turning away from the West under Erdogan over the past decade . Last year , 22 percent of Turkey 's exports went to the Middle East and North Africa , double the share in 2004 . While Turkey 's bid for membership of the European Union has dragged on since formal negotiations began in 2005 , Ankara has pursued free-trade accords with Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Iraq . In Libya , where Turkey had ventures worth $ 15.3 billion before an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi began in February , Turkish firms were forced to leave projects unfinished . Turkey has held joint military exercises and joint cabinet meetings with Syria and has abolished visa requirements , but those agreements might now be scaled down . Erdogan , whose country quietly hosted a conference of Syrian opposition figures last week , has said that after Sunday 's vote Ankara would talk to Assad in a `` very different manner . '' Hugh Pope , an analyst at International Crisis Group , said events in Syria have shown the limits of Turkey 's policy and exposed the reality that Ankara has little leverage convincing Assad to change . `` Turkey is terribly frustrated at Assad , but I do n't think any country has any leverage in Syria at this point . The regime is in a survival mode , '' Pope said . However , he said Turkey 's close business and people 's ties might give it some leverage in the future . The wars in neighboring Iraq brought refugees and severely disrupted trade with Turkey , but now Turkish firms are busy doing brisk businesses in Iraq . `` Whatever happens in Syria Turkey will adapt . '' Turkey was caught off guard at the time of the 1991 Gulf War , when 500,000 people flooded across the border from northern Iraq , but this time has started early preparing for a possible mass influx of Syrian refugees . When the 2003 invasion of Iraq was being planned , Turks made arrangements to set up a buffer zone inside Iraq to look after any refugees on Iraqi soil . In the event , only around 10,000 came . Some media have reported that Turkish political and military officials are considering a similar zone in the Syria case if the number of refugees increases sharply , but officials have told Reuters they are not aware of such plans . When asked about the possibility , Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters : `` It 's not on the agenda right now . '' Damascus would not welcome the prospect of Turkish boots on Syrian soil . Turkey and Syria went to the brink of war in 1998 when Ankara exerted pressure on Damascus to expel Kurdistan Workers Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan who was sheltered there . The expulsion and capture of Ocalan resolved the crisis .

China and Vietnam have hurled accusations at each other for weeks over what each sees as intrusions into its territorial waters by the other in a swath of ocean crossed by key shipping lanes and thought to hold large deposits of oil and gas . Such accusations are not uncommon between China , Vietnam and the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei and Taiwan , which are also involved in long-standing maritime disputes in the South China Sea , but this bout of tension has run longer than usual .

They 're not aimed at confronting any country , '' said the source , who declined to be identified . He declined to confirm that the drills were under way .

China 's Global Times , a popular tabloid with a nationalist bent run by Communist Party mouthpiece the People 's Daily , said the drills were `` a military show of force to defy Beijing .

China has denied that its ships have done anything wrong . In Washington , a key Democratic lawmaker on Asia policy said he would introduce a U.S. Senate resolution urging China to cease military actions and enter into multilateral talks on maritime territorial disputes with its neighbors . `` We need to send a very clear signal to the Chinese , '' said Senator Jim Webb , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee . `` We need to do our part as a balancing force to bring these issues to the table , '' he said in a speech at a think tank . Washington must `` back up what we said '' last year , when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed U.S. support for a collective regional solution to the mosaic of territorial disputes in the South China Sea , Webb added . Computer hackers on both sides of the border have taken matters into their own hands , according to media accounts , posting pro-China or pro-Vietnam messages on scores of the other country 's websites , including some belonging to the government . Monday , Hanoi publicized a June 10 directive from Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordering government agencies to enhance their digital security and develop contingency plans in the face of `` serious threats .

Chinese banks lent 551.6 billion yuan -LRB- $ 85.1 billion -RRB- in local currency loans in May , missing market forecasts for 610 billion yuan , the People 's Bank of China said on Monday . Yuan loans outstanding at the end of May were 17.1 percent higher than a year ago , the central bank said in a statement on its website : -LRB- www.pbc.gov.cn -RRB- Annual growth in China 's broad M2 measure of money supply slowed to 15.1 percent in May , the weakest expansion in 30 months , following a rise of 15.3 percent in April . The median forecast of economists was for a 15.4 percent increase in M2 and a 17.1 percent rise in outstanding loans . `` The lending growth last month was slower than market expectations , showing that tightening measures are biting , '' said E Yongjian , an analyst at the Bank of Communications in Shanghai . `` But it is still too early to say that the loan demand is declining because of a slowing economy , and we should not read too much into a single month 's loan data . '' Credit curbs are the center piece of China 's monetary policy aimed at the root cause of inflation , which is still running near 3-year highs . The central bank has raised banks ' required reserves and interest rates . Commercial banks have also been told to scale back lending to the property sector and to financing vehicles run by local governments . Even so , analysts believe Beijing still faces a tough battle ahead . There is a growing pool of credit in China that falls outside traditional bank loans , including trust loans and bankers ' acceptance bills . JPMorgan estimates that such alternative forms of credit have reduced the share of bank lending in China 's total financing to 59 percent last year , from 92 percent in 2002 . Xu Nuojin , the deputy head of the People 's Bank of China Guangzhou branch , said in comments published on Monday that inflation could become entrenched because price rises are still driven by too much cash in the economy . `` The current inflation level is achieved through the forceful policy intervention by the government , an all-around rebound is very likely to occur once such administrative measures are relaxed , '' he said . China 's annual inflation is expected to have edged up to 5.4 percent in May from 5.3 percent in April , matching a 32-month high recorded in March . -LRB- $ 1 = 6.480 yuan -RRB- -LRB- Reporting by Aileen Wang , Koh Gui Qing and Kevin Yao ; Editing by Ken Wills -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "263", "dct": "2011-06-13", "dates": ["2011-06-13", "2011-06-13", "2011-06-13", "2011-06-13", "2020-01-01", "2022-01-01", "2022-01-01", "2011-06-13"], "text": "WARSAW , June 13 | Mon Jun 13 , 2011 5:08 pm BST WARSAW , June 13 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Poland 's junior coalition partner , the Peasants ' Party -LRB- PSL -RRB- , wants a referendum on the country 's plans to introduce nuclear technology to lower its reliance on the highly-polluting coal .

Official figures showed turnout easily exceeding the 50 percent quorum needed to validate four referendums , including one on a ban on nuclear power . Supporters of the proposals were considered far more likely to vote than opponents and early results showed well over 90 percent of votes cast were in favor of the ban . The referendum abrogates a law passed last year restarting Italy 's nuclear program , which had previously been halted in 1987 by another referendum following the Chernobyl disaster . The government , conscious of the backlash from Fukushima , had recently suspended the nuclear program in an attempt to undermine the referendum . But the vote was seen as ending any prospect of atomic energy in this country in the foreseeable future . It extended the global impact of the Fukushima disaster after Japan was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami in March . Germany shut down its seven oldest plants after the disaster and decided last month to close all its reactors by 2022 , in a major policy reversal by Chancellor Angela Merkel . Polls show most Italians , like Germans , are against nuclear energy , an emotion increased by Fukushima in a country which is prone to frequent earthquakes . Berlusconi is a strong supporter of nuclear power . His centre-right government had argued atomic electricity generation was essential for energy security in Italy , which imports almost all its power and has some of the highest prices in Europe -- partly because of the lack of any nuclear plants . But Fukushima , combined with a strong effort by the centre-left opposition to get out the vote as a political slap in the face to the prime minister , made selling such plans an uphill battle . Rome resident Flavio Rellandini said after the vote : `` I am really happy . I mean twenty years ago we said the same thing against nuclear power . I just do n't understand why they spent all this money to reconfirm this ... We do not want nuclear plants . '' Berlusconi said on Monday , before the referendum result was announced , `` We must probably say goodbye to the possibility of nuclear power stations and we must strongly commit ourselves to renewable energy '' . Shares of Italian renewable energy companies rose after his comments , made at a news conference . Italy , which imports nuclear-generated power from France , gets more than 50 percent of its electricity from gas , most of which is imported . The nuclear vote was one of four successful referendums that are a further setback to Berlusconi , already severely weakened by local elections in May , when centre-right candidates suffered humiliating defeats , including in his powerbase of Milan . Analysts say his second political miscalculation in a few weeks -- he urged Italians not to vote in the referendums -- would increase pressure on his coalition partners the Northern League to pull out the rug from under Berlusconi 's government before scheduled elections in 2013 . The other referendums were on water privatisation and trial immunity for government ministers -- the latter condemned by Berlusconi 's opponents as part of a strategy to get him off the hook in four concurrent trials for fraud , corruption and paying for sex with a teenage nightclub dancer .

China 's main military newspaper was blunter . `` China resolutely opposes any country unrelated to the South China Sea issue meddling in disputes , and it opposes the internationalisation of the South China Sea issue , '' said a commentary in the Liberation Army Daily . China 's statements coincided with naval exercises by Vietnam 's military along its central coast , and followed a weekend statement by Hanoi welcoming efforts by the international community , including the United States , to help resolve the maritime disputes . China and Vietnam have traded accusations for weeks over what each sees as intrusions into its territorial waters by the other in a stretch of ocean spanned by key shipping lanes and thought to hold large deposits of oil and gas . Beijing has said it is not to blame . `` The recent developments in the South China Sea were the result of unilateral actions by some countries that damaged China 's sovereignty and maritime rights , '' spokesman Hong said . `` China has been protecting its legitimate rights and not violating those of other countries . '' Accusations of unlawful intrusions in the South China Sea are not uncommon between China , Vietnam and the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei and Taiwan , but this bout of tension has run longer than usual . Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung signed a decree on Monday listing the types of cases which would be exempt in the event of a military draft in time of war . The decree takes effect from Aug. 1 . `` Vietnam is speaking to two audiences , '' Carlyle Thayer , a Vietnam expert at the Australian Defense Force Academy , told Reuters . `` It 's speaking to a domestic audience where it is under pressure to be shown to be taking steps to deal with China . The other is to China . '' China 's latest comments were in response to those from a key U.S. Democratic lawmaker on Asia policy , Senator Jim Webb , who said on Monday he would introduce a resolution urging China to enter into multilateral talks on maritime territorial disputes with its neighbors . Tension between China and the United States intensified last year after the Obama administration became embroiled in the South China Sea dispute by stressing Washington 's support for a collective solution . This year , Sino-U.S relations have steadied , and Washington has so far been more muted about the issue . Beijing insists on handling the disputes on a one-on-one basis rather than multilaterally , a strategy some critics have described as `` divide and conquer '' . A Vietnamese military source confirmed the live-fire drills were under way . Vietnam 's military newspaper accused China at the weekend of creating disputes `` through provocative actions -LRB- and -RRB- hostilities aimed at its neighbors '' .

Jockey Richard Hughes rode a supremely confident race , sitting at the back in the early stages before producing Canford Cliffs , the 11-8 second favorite , to challenge inside the final furlong . The four-year-old secured his fourth Group One triumph , producing his renowned turn of foot to win by a length from 5-4 favorite Goldikova . Victory was sweet compensation for trainer Richard Hannon , whose Paco Boy was beaten by a neck by Goldikova in the race last year . `` These sort of horses do n't come along very often , '' said Hannon , father-in-law of the winning jockey . `` He had a good lead from Goldikova and Hughsie did n't lose sight of her . Thankfully when it came to it he was able to go by her . It 's a shame really for anyone to beat the mare as she 's been so good but someone has to take her on . '' It was a third consecutive win at Royal Ascot for Canford Cliffs having won the Coventry Stakes in 2009 and last year 's St James 's Palace Stakes . Goldikova , who completed an unprecedented third Breeders ' Cup Mile triumph in the United States in November , was also given a rousing reception by racegoers on her return to the paddock on a warm and sunny afternoon . `` I was thrilled with that . The people here know a champion , '' said trainer Freddy Head . `` I think she ran a top , top race and is as good as ever . '' Britain 's Queen Elizabeth unveiled a statue of four-time Ascot Gold Cup winner Yeats in the parade ring before the start of the Royal meeting with the racecourse commemorating 300 years of racing in 2011 . The Queen suffered disappointment as an owner earlier this month when her Carlton House , favorite for the Epsom Derby , could only finish third . That race was bypassed by Henry Cecil 's Frankel because of stamina doubts and the colt had to dig deep to extend his unbeaten record to seven races , holding on to win the St James 's Palace Stakes from the fast closing Zoffany . Frankel 's workmanlike victory was a stark contrast to his scintillating English 2,000 Guineas win last month and 68-year-old Cecil , awarded a knighthood last week , breathed a sigh of relief after celebrating his 73rd Royal Ascot success . `` That was a bit nerve-wracking and it did n't go to plan , '' said Cecil after the 30-100 favorite held by three-quarters of a length after tiring in the closing stages of the one mile contest . `` He looked as if he was going to win a bit more easily and I think he thought that he had just done enough . The horse is a gentleman but complicated '' Zoffany 's Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien gained swift compensation when 4-1 favorite Power won the Coventry Stakes while Prohibit , a well-backed 7-1 chance , handed British trainer Robert Cowell and jockey Jim Crowley a first Royal Ascot success .

The group noted that the greater demand for roads and rail networks , and other public facilities , over the next decade translated to investment requirements totaling $ A360 billion to $ A770 billion . In April , Lend Lease hired Duncan Taylor as head of infrastructure funds and mandates . He has been sounding out investors with a view to launching infrastructure funds , or form joint ventures and club deals . Projects involving hospitals and schools were popular with investors , Gupta said , noting Lend Lease had a strong track record in the wholesale unlisted property space . Lend Lease launched Australia 's first unlisted property trust in 1959 and is now one of the leading wholesale property fund managers in the country . `` We want to leverage those relationships and those models into the infrastructure space , '' he added . In 2010 , Lend Lease upped its infrastructure offering by acquiring Australian construction and engineering contractor Valemus from Germany 's Bilfinger Berger 's -LRB- GBFG . Abigroup , a part of Valemus , has since won a $ A900 million contract to build the second stage of the Queensland Children 's Hospital . `` We have been in multiple PPPs -LRB- private public partnerships -RRB- and the track record that we are finding investors see as attractive , '' Taylor said . The Australian government was also taking steps to encourage private investments , announcing a new infrastructure tax incentive as part of the 2011\\/12 federal budget . -LRB- Reporting by Eriko Amaha ; Editing by Andrew Macdonald -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "292", "dct": "2011-06-16", "dates": ["2009-12-15", "2011-06-16", "2011-06-16", "2011-06-22", "2011-06-23", "2011-01-01", "2011-05-01", "2010-01-01", "2012-01-01", "2011-06-16"], "text": "Mature grain ready for harvesting stands in a farmer 's field near Goulburn , about 80km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- northeast of Canberra , December 15 , 2009 . BRASILIA | Thu Jun 16 , 2011 6:08 pm BST BRASILIA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The G20 group of large economies will jointly monitor world supplies of key grains to help prevent speculation from driving up food prices , according to a draft statement of a ministerial meeting next week . Farm ministers gathering in Paris on June 22-23 would also call on the group 's finance ministers to control food commodity speculation by adopting stricter regulations for food derivatives markets , the statement , obtained by Reuters , said . Global food prices rallied earlier this year on rising grain costs , renewing concern about food security and inflationary pressure , particularly in some developing countries . Food prices have since eased but in May remained 37 percent above the previous year . France has made stronger regulation of commodities markets , mainly agricultural , a priority of its year-long presidency of the Group of 20 leading economies . Under the proposed statement , the G20 would share market information through a database -- the Agricultural Market Information System -LRB- AMIS -RRB- -- to be housed within the Rome-based United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation -LRB- FAO -RRB- . Non-G20 members and private-sector players would be encouraged to participate in the database on wheat , corn , soy and rice , which would later be expanded to include other foods . `` We emphasise that AMIS will enable financial actors and market regulators to be better informed of the fundamentals of physical markets . Transparency on physical markets is important for derivatives markets but the reverse is also true , '' the statement said . Its creation would be a boost to French President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of next year 's presidential election . In a speech to French farm unions on Thursday , he urged agriculture ministers to back the database creation . The data would also be used to inform a proposed Rapid Response Forum that would mobilise broad political support for policies affecting agricultural production and in the response to crises in agricultural production . `` We agree that risk management of food price volatility in developed and developing countries would provide an important contribution to promote longer term agricultural development , '' the statement said . G20 farm ministers would also back a UN World Food Program pilot project for emergency humanitarian food reserves , as well as World Bank efforts to boost food security in vulnerable countries during food price surges and external shocks . At their meeting next week , they also will back the scrapping of taxes on food donations . Other proposals would seek increased coordination and sharing of crop forecast data obtained by satellite and more analysis on the effects of using food crops for biofuel production . -LRB- Reporting by Peter Murphy ; Editing by Raymond Colitt and Dale Hudson -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Just three months ago it would have been unthinkable to have even criticized him and Assad told businessmen last year , before the uprising against him : `` I wish Syria had 10 Rami Makhloufs . '' Yet by March , his name was already being uttered by demonstrators trying to burn down the premises of his telecoms operation while chanting : `` Go away Makhlouf . We do n't want thieves . '' The announcement on state television that he is taking a lesser business role and moving into charity work will be no doubt be widely seen as aimed at helping the ruling family survive the turmoil -- even though campaigners scoffed at the move . A close friend and confidant of Assad , Makhkouf controls companies with outright monopolies or semi monopolies in duty free , airlines , telecoms , real estate , oil , construction and import businesses . Aref Dalila , a leading economist , was jailed for eight years after he criticized the state for awarding a cellphone contract to Makhlouf that created Syriatel , the country 's largest mobile phone operator . The tycoon , who has been under U.S. sanctions since 2008 for what Washington calls public corruption and was put under EU sanctions last month , has repeatedly said he is a legitimate businessman whose firms provide jobs for thousands of Syrians . Makhlouf belongs to Assad 's Alawite minority sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , which rose to dominate political system in majority Sunni Syria after controlling the army following a coup that brought the Baath Party to power in a 1963 . Alawites influence have spread to business , undermining a Sunni merchant establishment that had traditionally dominated commerce -- although Makhlouf sought to placate Sunnis by bringing them into a holding company he set up five years ago . He is seen by many protesters as a front for more powerful family members , including Assad himself . He also began taking a more political role , appearing on television to promote ties with Turkey and participating in meetings with Iraqi officials to improve relations , diplomats in the Syrian capital said . His father Mohammad , a brother of Assad 's mother Anissa , also amassed a fortune under the rule of Assad 's father , the late Hafez al-Assad , and still plays a major role in managing the Makhlouf fortune , businessmen and diplomats say . Before the uprising , Makhlouf had been changing the structure of the his companies by inviting Syrian and gulf shareholders , they added . `` Makhlouf has been trying to improve his image and portray himself as a regional businessman , '' one of the sources said . A leading opposition figure dismissed the move to charity as a cosmetic attempt to placate a public angry at the widespread corruption he said Makhlouf epitomized and doubted Makhlouf would lose his position as one of the country 's power elite . `` The news that Makhlouf will be donating to the Syrian people money he obtained by corruption and from monopolies granted to him because of his family links is comic , '' Walid al-Bunni told Reuters by phone from Damascus . `` The announcement would have had some credibility if Makhlouf had said he returned the billions of dollars he had amassed to the treasury . The Syrian people may then think of forgiving him . '' One businessman said that Makhlouf 's rise began with the death of Assad 's brother Basil in car accident in the 1990s . The death of Basil , who was being groomed to succeed his father , brought in Bashar to politics . `` The difference between Bashar and Basil is that Basil was not under the influence of his cousins , '' the businessman said . Makhlouf told the New York Times in an interview last month that Syria 's ruling family will fight protesters `` to the end '' and hinted that Israel 's stability could be threatened if Assad was toppled . In a rare public statement , Syrian authorities said that Makhlouf was a private citizen and that his views did not represent the Syrian state .

In the cyber realm , as in other areas of security , the human factor is a pervasive vulnerability , be it theft by malicious `` insiders '' or inadvertent breaches by employees clicking on a compromised link , analysts say . More rigorous training may not end the abuse of corporate cyber systems -- the sophistication of some hacker tactics is so great that 100 percent security is probably unattainable -- but it can significantly reduce the risks , specialists say . The same goes for the adoption of intrusive new ways of monitoring employee online behavior and compliance with good cyber practice , some security specialists say . '' -LRB- High-tech -RRB- Bells and whistles are no use if you do n't have trusted , loyal and well-informed staff , '' said an industry executive who spoke recently at a closed door cyber seminar . Many experts say much more can be done to tighten security at the `` endpoint '' -- in other words , people -- rather than place excessive reliance on clever software , important as that is . Some experts see a need to carry out security vetting when hiring key staff , for example computer system administrators . `` Technology is only a part of the problem -- all systems are composed of people , processes and technology -- you only need to break one of the components to attack the system , '' said Steve Purser , a senior expert at the European Network and Information Security Agency , a European Union body . He said there were no hard and fast rules about monitoring staff online because data differed in sensitivity and context . `` The important point is to communicate the rules to staff and to ensure that the rules are being followed , '' he said . The need is urgent , not least because employers are worried recession may swell the ranks of staff in line for retrenchment who plan to take proprietary data with them out of the door . Some are queasy about the notion of intruding on employees ' online work . But then , analysts note , hackers are doing exactly the same thing -- and imperiling jobs into the bargain . `` It 's the people side of the equation that is letting the bad guys through right now , '' Neil Fisher , Vice President of Global Security Solutions at Unisys Corp told Reuters . He was referring to ` phishing ' attacks , a hacker ploy to obtain data such as passwords or bank details by posing as a legitimate institution . In advanced `` spear-phishing '' campaigns hackers craft personalized e-mails , often using data available on social media websites , duping recipients into downloading attachments that launch malicious software that takes over their computers . Such ploys are suspected in at least some recent prominent attacks , which have targeted entities such as the International Monetary Fund , Central Intelligence Agency , the U.S. Senate , and companies such as Citigroup and Lockheed Martin . Mohan Koo , CEO of Dtex Systems -LRB- UK -RRB- , said most organizations tended to over-prioritize the risk of external threats , a tendency he said was prevalent in the financial sector . `` For years now investment banks have lived by the motto Know Your Customer ' today it 's more critical that they focus on Know Your Insider ' because that is where they have a weakness . '' `` The problem is that most organizations do n't monitor their insiders with a sufficient level of granularity to quantify the threat to their business . If they did , the shock would be sufficient to spark a significant change in their approach . '' A March 28 study by computer security firm McAfee and U.S. government consulting company SAIC said the most significant threat reported by organizations when protecting information was data leaked accidentally or intentionally by employees . ECONOMIC PAIN MAY RAISE RISK OF ABUSE The risk of malicious theft of data or intellectual property by insiders for private gain or to boost value to potential new employers may rise as Western economies struggle , analysts say . A 2011 survey of cyber crime by Verizon , the U.S. Secret Service and the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit noted concern among industry experts that financial strain would cause an increase in insider abuse , although evidence was sparse so far . An 2010 Imperva cyber security company study of 1,026 people in several business districts in London showed that if rumors were circulating about possible redundancies , 37 percent of respondents said they would want to take information with them . Tony Dyhouse , a security expert at Britain 's ICT Knowledge Transfer Network , told Reuters a lot of the insider threat was actually `` from people who are no longer inside . '' `` They 've left the company but they still have access credentials , they may still have site passes and computer access . All too often people leave the company and their accounts are not closed down . `` People are aware of the value of data and they will try and keep things and send information home . They actually take preemptive action , so ` now I am going to get my own back , or at least I am going to make sure I have the capability to do so ' .

The expansion of the China Maritime Surveillance -LRB- CMS -RRB- forces , a paramilitary law enforcement agency that patrols China 's territorial waters , was unveiled two days after the country sent its largest civilian maritime patrol ship to the South China Sea . The moves show Beijing 's resolve to protect its `` maritime rights and sovereignty '' which it says have been increasingly violated amid a rising frequency of disputes , but other claimants are also keen to show they are not backing down . The Philippines has sent its largest warship -- a Second World War-vintage destroyer escort -- on a patrol that would take it through the disputed Scarborough Shoals in the South China Sea , off its main island of Luzon . `` The navy conducts regular offshore patrols and we should not connect the deployment of Rajah Humabon to the deployment of China 's maritime vessel , '' said Eduardo Batac , spokesman for the Philippine Defense Department . Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario met diplomats from the nine other Association of South East Asian Nations states in Manila , urging a common position and approach to resolve the South China Sea dispute . China 's maritime forces , under the State Oceanic Administration , will have 16 aircraft and 350 vessels by the end of the country 's five-year plan ending in 2015 , and more than 15,000 personnel and 520 vessels by 2020 , the official China Daily said citing an unnamed senior official . It did not give a price tag . `` There have been an increasing number of intrusions by foreign vessels and planes into Chinese waters and airspace in recent years , '' the newspaper said . It said that the coastal forces had logged 1,303 foreign ships and 214 planes intruding in 2010 , compared with a total of 110 cases in 2007 . Tensions in the South China Sea have risen in the past month on concerns that China is becoming more assertive in the waters , parts of which are also claimed by Brunei , Malaysia , the Philippines , Taiwan and Vietnam . A commentary from China 's official Xinhua news agency blamed the tension solely on United States wading into the dispute . The United States ' statements had emboldened China 's neighbors , `` and only then did they dare adopt a ultra-hawkish stance in voicing their positions , '' the commentary said . China 's claim is by far the largest , forming a large U-shape over most of the sea 's 648,000 square miles -LRB- 1.7 million square km -RRB- , including the Spratly and Paracel archipelagos . This week , Beijing warned outside countries not to step into the dispute , after Vietnam said other countries , including the United States , could help defuse the tension . China has accused Vietnam of violating its claim to the Spratlys and nearby seas , which Vietnam also deems its own . China calls the islands the Nansha group . Beijing said last week it would hold naval drills in June in the western Pacific Ocean and the navy plans to launch its first aircraft carrier as early as this year . The maritime forces have grown rapidly since Liu Cigui , 55 , took over as head of the State Oceanic Administration last March after a stint as mayor of the southeastern city of Xiamen . Liu , head of Fujian 's provincial oceanic and fishery bureau from 2000 to 2002 , is no stranger to maritime matters . `` Liu Cigui decided to beef up China Maritime Surveillance by adding ships and helicopters to its South Sea , East Sea and North Sea fleets '' to safeguard territorial waters and the country 's marine economy , a source with ties to the Oceanic Administration told Reuters . Liu put the output of China 's marine economy at 3.8 trillion yuan $ 586.8 billion -LRB- 363 billion pounds -RRB- in 2010 , accounting for 9.7 percent of gross domestic output . He did not give a comparative figure . Maritime surveillance personnel are mainly retired navy men and officers , the source said , requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to reporters . China Maritime Surveillance was founded in 1998 , and its duties include protecting the maritime environment . China has 32,000 km -LRB- 20,000 miles -RRB- and 350,000 square km -LRB- 135,000 square miles -RRB- of territorial waters and internal waters , according to state news agency Xinhua .

The maker of luxury bags and Miu Miu dresses , which had originally hoped to raise as much as $ 2.6 billion , priced its initial public offering -LRB- IPO -RRB- at HK$ 39.50 a share , three sources with direct knowledge of the deal said on Friday . Fund managers said that while luxury investors are used to paying more for high-end discretionary brands , Prada had to adapt its initial ambition due to market volatility . A poor Hong Kong debut by luggage brand Samsonite International on Thursday augured ill for Prada 's offering , the biggest on the exchange so far this year . `` Luxury demand is very self explanatory , and it makes a lot of sense for companies like Samsonite and Prada to list in Hong Kong , but we 're talking about quite a volatile market , '' said Selina Sia , head of consumer research at Mirae Asset . Prada had set an indicative price range of HK$ 36.5 to HK$ 48 per share , before narrowing it to between HK$ 39.50 and HK$ 42.25 a share on Thursday . At the top of its original range , Prada would trade at 27 times projected 2011 earnings , far higher than an average of 20.4 times for luxury retailers such as LVMH and Hermes International SCA , according to Phillip Securities ' forecasts . At the revised guidance Prada would trade at a P\\/E of 22.8-24 .4 times , more in line with global rivals . Prada and shareholders Prada Holding BV and Intesa Sanpaolo sold 423.3 million shares in the offering , raising HK$ 16.72 billion -LRB- $ 2.14 billion -RRB- , said the sources . The IPO valued Prada at about $ 13 billion , compared with the nearly $ 80 billion market capitalization of LVMH , $ 28.5 billion for Hermes and $ 21 billion for PPR SA . Prada , set up in 1913 by Mario Prada as a business selling leather bags , trunks and silverware to the European elite , has become a global fashion empire , with 319 directly operated stores , a third of which are in Asia Pacific . The move by retailers such as Prada to list in Hong Kong is part of a trend to raise brand awareness in China . As part of the marketing for its offering , Prada hosted a fashion show for top fund managers , who jostled for space at the glitzy Grand Hyatt Hotel in Hong Kong to see Miuccia Prada 's creations and hear about China 's booming demand for luxury goods . China 's consumption of luxury goods is forecast to grow 18 percent annually to about $ 27.5 billion by 2015 , from about $ 12.2 billion in 2010 , according to consultancy McKinsey . But some investors were concerned that Prada 's growth targets -- it expects sales to rise more than 20 percent over the next three years if the global economy continues to improve -- were too ambitious . `` Prada is a very strong brand , but it has an aggressive growth strategy which looks more difficult to achieve in the current economic environment , '' said Scilla Huang Sun , who runs a luxury fund for Swiss and Global Asset management . Despite volatile markets casting a cloud over Prada 's offering , it was nevertheless nearly three times oversubscribed at the listing price , one source said . Market uncertainty , which has also hit new listings in Europe this year , with more than 15 deals pulled and others performing poorly after their flotations , is expected to continue to affect offerings in Hong Kong in the short term . `` The market is going through a very difficult phase , '' said Philippe Espinasse , a former investment banker with Nomura and UBS in Hong Kong and author of `` IPO : a Global Guide '' . The benchmark Hang Seng Index has declined in 11 of the last 12 sessions , losing 7.6 percent , and world stocks hit a three-month low on Thursday , weighing on investor demand for new issues . Of the larger IPOs in Asia this year , only MGM China has posted a first-day gain . Prada 's listing was organised by Goldman Sachs , Credit Agricole 's CLSA brokerage and Italian banks UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo 's Banca IMI unit , which are both represented on Prada 's board . -LRB- $ 1 = 7.801 Hong Kong Dollars -RRB- -LRB- Additional reporting by Antonella Ciancio , Astrid Wendlandt , Kylie MacLellan ; Editing by Denny Thomas , Dhara Ranasinghe and Will Waterman -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "62", "dct": "2011-06-18", "dates": ["2011-06-18", "2011-03-01", "2011-06-18"], "text": "Syrian children praise God in a Turkish refugee camp .

For the second year in a row , the Environmental Protection Agency cut the amount of cellulosic ethanol that must be mixed into motor fuel . Next year , only 3.45 million to 12.9 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel will have to be mixed into the country 's gasoline pool by fuel blenders , far below the original goal of 500 million gallons . EPA slashed the target for this year to 6 million gallons from the 250 million gallons required in the renewable fuels standard Congress passed in 2005 . Cellulosic ethanol is made from grasses , wood chips and agricultural waste , which environmentalists and consumer groups say is better than using a food crop such as corn to make the fuel . Cellulosic has been envisioned as a key part of boosting the amount of renewable fuels used in the United States . Congress had mandated that 36 billion gallons of biofuels should be used in the United States by 2022 . Congress has mandated corn ethanol would top out at 15 billion gallons by 2015 , and that is on track . The EPA on Tuesday proposed increasing the use of corn-based ethanol to 13.2 billion gallons next year , matching what Congress required . But cellulosic is supposed to keep growing every year until it reaches 16 billion gallons by 2022 . So far it has failed to live up to expectations . The revised mandate could affect companies working to develop cellulosic including Solazyme -LRB- SZYM . O -RRB- , CleanTech Biofuels CLTH . PK , Coskata Inc , and KiOR Inc , which recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public . The main problem is the cost of producing cellulosic is still high and it may be years before that can brought down to compete with corn-based ethanol . Second-generation biofuel producers must rely on expensive enzymes . So the ethanol industry must depend largely on the corn crop , fueling criticism the business is driving up food prices worldwide . `` They 've been looking for the magic formula for a cheap enzyme that will break down the cellulose but they 're still far from it , '' said Rick Kment , an ethanol analyst at Telvent DTN . Enzymes used to make cellulosic can cost up to $ 2 per gallon . When the costs of building and maintaining biorefineries , labor , and transportation are added to the enzyme costs , cellulosic is far more expensive than gasoline . In addition , the available amount of research and development money for advanced biofuels has fallen . A new study this month concluded there is an 11-year gap between wood-based biofuels production and its commercial viability . `` Major technical hurdles will likely disrupt commercialization for most of the technologies under development , '' said Bruce Schiamberg of the Schiamberg Group , the co-author of the study . But the EPA was hopeful . `` The agency remains optimistic that the commercial availability of cellulosic biofuel will continue to grow in the years ahead , '' EPA said . About 11 percent of all motor fuel used in 2012 will come from biofuels , up sharply from about 8 percent this year , the EPA said . With ethanol output this year expected to total 13.5 billion gallons , ethanol producers already exceed the 2012 target of 13.2 billion gallons . This year 's corn-based ethanol use target is 12.6 billion gallons .

BEIRUT | Tue Jun 21 , 2011 12:20 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's pledges of political reform offer little sign that he is prepared to ease his family 's four-decade grip on power and deliver Syria from its most serious crisis in decades . Breaking a two-month silence on Monday to tackle the wave of protests against his rule , Assad promised new laws on political parties and elections and a review of the constitution which enshrines the ruling Baath Party at the center of politics . But his speech was met with a chorus of angry disappointment from world leaders and activists , who said it was too little , too late , and too vague . Criticism predictably poured in from Washington and the European Union , which had already imposed sanctions on Assad and his top officials in response to a military crackdown in which rights groups say 1,300 civilians have been killed . Even neighboring Turkey , which has cultivated close ties with Assad , indicated it was losing patience after repeatedly urging him to implement swift and decisive reform . `` Assad should clearly and precisely say : ` Everything has changed . We 're transforming the system into a multi-party one , '' President Abdullah Gul said . A Syrian activist group dismissed Assad 's speech as `` a repetition of unrealized promises -LRB- and -RRB- veiled threats '' which failed to address the crisis in Syria or the aspirations of tens of thousands still demonstrating in defiance of the crackdown . While accepting that Syria faced a grave crisis and acknowledging criticism over the slow pace of change , Assad repeated themes of his two previous speeches in March and April -- that the country faced a foreign conspiracy and that the violence was the fault of criminals and religious extremists . He made no mention of any role security forces played in the bloodshed and sought to distinguish between people with rightful demands and `` saboteurs '' he said were behind unrest . `` He did not give any indication on the core issue that he is willing to facilitate a genuine transition away from the continued monopoly on power of his family and the ruling Baath Party , '' said analyst Julien Barnes-Dacey of Control Risks . `` He is following the failed path of the other regional leaders by seeking to delegitimize the opposition while simultaneously resorting to a harsh security crackdown . '' A Damascus-based analyst , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue in Syria , said Assad had missed another opportunity to stake out a credible way forward . `` He failed to address the two fundamental issues that have come to shape the crisis in the eyes of many Syrians , namely the dismal behavior of the security services and his own lack of decisive leadership , '' he said . Assad said more than 100 people `` from different sections of society '' would be invited within days to consultative meetings to discuss the framework of a national dialogue promised by the government more than a month ago . Opposition figures have yet to formulate a response to any invitation to join the meetings , but several have said that no dialogue can succeed while the security crackdown continues and thousands of political detainees remain in jail . Even were they to attend , it is not clear what impact that would have on street protests which initially called for greater freedom but which for weeks now have demanded Assad 's overthrow . `` It is hard to see a simple pathway to implementing this reform program , '' said Ayham Kamel , an analyst at Eurasia Group . `` Military force will still be utilised to confront at least part of the opposition . This would make it hard for many opposition figures to enter a negotiation process with the regime or join the national dialogue committee . '' Kamel said the speech was likely to polarize Syrian society , with Assad loyalists seeing it as proof that the president was ready for tangible concessions , while opponents dismiss it as inconsequential . Those tensions were visible in several Syrian cities on Tuesday , as tens of thousands of Assad supporters rallied in cities across the country , leading to clashes with protesters in which activists said security forces shot dead seven people . `` There are fractures that run through Syrian society , and the regime is seeking to play on those to cement its hold on power , '' Barnes-Dacey said . `` If this conflict becomes militarized there is a real prospect of some form of civil war . '' He said that while security forces could help Assad maintain his grip in the short term , the deadlock with protesters and the deteriorating economy -- hit by a collapse in tourism and a likely halt in foreign investment -- meant his prospects over the coming months and years were less certain . Assad himself acknowledged that the most dangerous prospect was `` the weakness or collapse of the Syrian economy , '' urging people to work together to `` restore confidence '' in the economy . `` The economics as much as the politics mean it will be very hard for Assad to survive , '' Barnes-Dacy said . One activist said he hoped for a more immediate result , noting that Assad had now made three speeches since the protests broke out -- the same number as the Tunisian and Egyptian leaders before they were ousted . `` Just as Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Hosni Mubarak fell after the third speech we are hopeful this will be the speech that will bring his downfall , '' said Abdullah Aba Zaid , a civic leader from the southern city of Deraa where the uprising erupted in March .

In research published in the journal Neuron , scientists in Israel used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to look at the brains of sleeping toddlers and found that certain types of neural activity are disrupted in autistic children , but not in typical children or in others with delayed language development . `` What we looked at is how the activity is synchronized , '' Ilan Dinstein of Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel , who led the study , said in a telephone interview . `` And we found that the synchronization was different -- specifically in toddlers with autism and across the hemispheres -LRB- of the brain -RRB- in areas related to language and communication . '' Autism is a complex and mysterious brain disorder usually first diagnosed in early childhood . It is characterized by difficulties in social interaction , communication , and understanding other people 's emotions and behavior . Autism disorders are diagnosed in up to one in 100 children in the United States and Europe and affect four times as many boys as girls , but the condition is very often misdiagnosed and doctors are keen to find biological measures to help pinpoint diagnosis and make it more accurate . `` There 's a tremendous amount of misdiagnosis in many different forms , '' Dinstein said . `` A child that might seem autistic at one and a half years old may turn out at three years old to have language delay or some other developmental disorder . So one of the reasons to look for a biological measure is to clarify the issue of diagnosis very early on . '' The human brain is split into two separate hemispheres , which are mostly symmetrical in terms of anatomy and function . Dinstein explained neural activity continues even during sleep and in a typical brain , normally correlates to certain patterns . Scientists believe the strength of synchronization between functionally related areas in the right and left hemispheres may be a measure of how well the brain is working . Dinstein 's team recorded brain activity in sleeping toddlers with typical development , language delay , and autism . Their results showed a specific abnormality in synchronization between two brain areas commonly associated with language and communication in 70 percent of toddlers with autism , but only in a handful of the typically developing toddlers or those with language delay . Dinstein said that as a potential diagnostic tool , this biological measure was `` a first step . '' He said another useful aspect of this measure was its ability to be taken during natural sleep , bypassing potential problems of getting a very young child to cooperate with a test . ly\\/lJhyOi Neuron , June 23 , 2011 .

Ribal al-Assad , who lives in London , also said religious extremists were hijacking the three-month uprising , and that a corrupt inner circle was manipulating the president into resisting concessions to the protest movement . `` We have to choose . Either we have peaceful transitional change , or we might find ourselves in a regional war . A civil war and a regional war ... It could easily happen , '' he told Reuters in an interview in London . Ribal is the son of Rifaat al-Assad , Bashar 's uncle and a former military commander widely held responsible for crushing an Islamist uprising in 1982 against then president Hafez al-Assad , Bashar 's father . Many thousands of people were killed . Ribal , 36 , denies his father was involved and believes he was framed for what he says were his pro-democracy sentiments . Rifaat turned against the regime in the 1980s and lives in exile , while Ribal campaigns for democratic change from London . Ribal said Bashar still had allies in the region , such as Iran and the Lebanese Shi'ite militant group Hezbollah . `` You have to be pragmatic and practical . He 's there , the regime is there . You have to do the best to pressure them to sit round a table to have a national unity government ... Bashar has allies . He 's not alone , '' Ribal said . Assad , 45 , promised reform when he succeeded his father in 2000 , but has opted for a bloody crackdown on demonstrators campaigning to end his family 's four-decade grip on power . Rights groups say some 1,300 civilians have been killed . The threat of sectarian civil war is already apparent . Bashar 's family and many other members of his administration belong to Syria 's minority Alawite sect , while the majority of the population is Sunni Muslim . Sectarian tensions have already spilled into Lebanon , where at least three people were killed in a clash between Alawis and Sunnis in the northern city of Tripoli Friday . In Syria there are signs of sectarian cracks between Alawites and Sunnis in the army . Ribal , an Alawite , said Sunni extremists , who consider Alawites heretics , were trying to hijack the protest movement to start a sectarian war . That pushes Alawites who might otherwise defect closer to Assad 's administration , Ribal said . At the same time , members of Assad 's inner circle are blocking the prospect of real reforms called for by protesters . `` There are people in the regime who do not want to see any reforms happening in Syria . They know very well that reforms mean they would lose their interests , they would be brought to justice , '' Ribal said . `` At the same time you have people on the other side , like the Islamists and the extremists who are pushing for sectarian war , without calculating what a disaster it would be for Syria and the region , '' he added . Ribal , who lived in Syria till the age of nine , says he and his father have no political ambitions , despite having the support of `` millions '' in Syria . It is unclear how seriously the opposition movement takes him or his father . Monday Assad pledged reforms , including new laws on political parties and elections , but they were seen by opponents as too little , too late and too vague . `` The protesters still have n't seen anything ... He does n't need to set up a committee to abolish Article Eight of the constitution , which says the Baath Party is the leader of state and society . This could be done right away by presidential decree to show good will , '' Ribal said . If Assad can not make reforms , he should admit he is hostage to vested interests and side with the uprising , Ribal said . `` What Bashar has to know is that at the end of the day he will be blamed for everything because he 's the head of the government , the army , the Baath party , '' he added . `` If he ca n't stand up to those people , he has to come out and say ` I 've tried to do reforms since I came to power , but the people around me have not let me . I need you to help me . I 'm stepping down and taking the side of the people ' .

The move , which managers at Los Angeles outlets said took effect on Thursday , comes as fast-food companies are under pressure to stop using toys to market children 's meals that are high in calories , sugar , fat and salt . Lawmakers in San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara County have passed laws that will require kids ' meals to meet certain nutritional standards before they can be sold with toys . `` While we 've been aware of efforts to ban the inclusion of toys in kids ' meals , that did not drive our decision , '' Jack in the Box spokesman Brian Luscomb said . `` Our advertising and promotions have focused exclusively on the frequent fast-food customer , not children , '' added Randy Carmical , also a Jack in the Box spokesman . Carmical said the San Diego-based company has been more focused on the food in its meals for children , such as grilled cheese sandwiches or grilled chicken strips . The company pulled toys from the meals when it began offering parents the option of substituting sliced apples with caramel sauce as an alternative to French fries , he said . `` We believe that providing these kinds of options is more appealing to a parent than packaging a toy with lower-quality fare , '' Carmical said . The Jack in the Box decision won praise from organizations and advocates critical of the fast-food industry . `` It 's terrific that Jack in the Box has taken this step , '' said Margo Wootan , nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest . `` It 's really a monumental step that I hope their competitors will emulate . '' CSPI in December sued McDonald 's Corp , the world 's largest hamburger chain , to stop it from using Happy Meal toys to lure children into its restaurants . Consumer and health advocates are using the announcement to put pressure on McDonalds , Burger King , Taco Bell and other fast food chains that still include toys in kids ' meals . Lobbyists for fast-food companies are fighting anti-obesity laws by asking U.S. state legislators to remove restaurant marketing from local governments ' regulatory menu . Toy giveaways make up more than half of the marketing expenditures in the fast-food industry , according to Wootan , with $ 360 million spent annually to put toys in kids meals . Jack in the Box has about 2,200 restaurants across the United States , where it is the fifth-largest hamburger chain .

June 's survey shows a third of people now think that Labor has the best policies on healthcare -LRB- 37 percent -RRB- compared to 21 percent . This is a Labor lead of 16 points , compared to 9 points in March last year , when the question was last asked . It is the highest lead Labor has enjoyed on healthcare - a key voting issue - since 2002 . Healthcare was the second most important issue to voting at the 2010 general election after the economy . The Conservative-led coalition government last week diluted plans for radical reform of the cherished National Health Service after complaints from nurses , doctors and patients . Prime Minister David Cameron said his government had got things wrong after draft legislation prompted fears it planned to dismantle a system that gives patients free access to doctors and hospitals . When asked about the NHS over the next 12 months , the most negative impact of the government 's reforms was expected to be seen on waiting times ; two in five of those surveyed by Ipsos MORI thought waiting times will get worse . While a significant minority thought the next 12 months would bring greater efficiency to the NHS -LRB- 20 percent -RRB- , twice as many thought the efficiency with which the NHS spends public money will get worse -LRB- 39 percent -RRB- . A similar proportion thought it would stay the same -LRB- 35 percent -RRB- . However , the poll also suggests that concerns about healthcare have not yet shifted people 's voting plans . In fact , support for the Conservatives increased slightly this month while the Labor vote share fell . Among all those who are certain to vote , 37 percent would vote Conservative , 39 percent would vote Labor while 11 percent would vote Liberal Democrat , the government 's junior coalition partners . The public is evenly split on whether public sector workers are right to go on strike , suggesting public sector workers could struggle to win the battle for hearts and minds over their plans to stage mass stoppages . Public sector union Unison has threatened a program of rolling , widescale industrial action over changes to public pensions , and teachers and other groups have already voted to strike as the government slashes spending to rein in its deficit . A third of the public thought trade unions had too much power today , although three-quarters believed they were essential to protect workers ' rights -- a level that has changed little since Ipsos MORI first asked the question in 1975 . -RRB- And while agreement that unions have too much power has increased since Ipsos MORI last asked the question in 1995 -LRB- 35 percent compared to 24 percent -RRB- , this is much lower than during the 1970s and 80s when over two-thirds of the public consistently agreed that unions were too powerful .

PRAGUE | Thu Jun 23 , 2011 3:45 pm BST PRAGUE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The planned U.S. troop reduction in Afghanistan does not mean any relaxation in pressure on the insurgency , Prime Minister David Cameron said on Thursday , while his government resisted calls to detail its own withdrawal timeline . U.S. President Barack Obama announced Wednesday he planned to withdraw 33,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of next summer . After the withdrawal , about 70,000 U.S. troops will remain there . During a visit to fellow NATO member Czech Republic , Cameron said it was significant that only 10,000 of the troops would leave this year , with the remainder in 2012 . `` What this means is there will be no let-up in the pressure on the insurgency in Afghanistan , '' he told a media briefing . `` I 'm satisfied that the removal of the -LRB- U.S. troop -RRB- surge will still enable us to keep up the pressure on the insurgency as we transition to Afghan control between now and 2014 . '' Obama 's plan will bring home the entire `` surge '' force that he sent to Afghanistan in 2010 . Although the war is unpopular among American voters , military advisers have said a rapid departure from Afghanistan is not a good idea because they fear it could allow Taliban insurgents to quickly regain lost territory . U.S. and NATO forces , with Britain and Germany supplying the next largest contingents , have been unable to deal a decisive blow to the Taliban , which was ousted from power in Afghanistan in 2001 . Britain has the second-biggest foreign troop contingent in Afghanistan with around 9,500 troops . Most of them are in the southern Helmand province , one of the most violent areas , and 374 have died in the decade-long war . French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Thursday he would follow Washington in starting a gradual withdrawal of France 's 4,000 troops in the U.S. - and NATO-led operation . But in London , Cameron 's spokesman said only that Britain would study the U.S. proposal . He would not reveal if Britain would follow its lead and announce a detailed drawdown timetable . `` We will consider the U.S. announcement . The national security council will consider that . We will probably have more to say about that in due course , '' the prime minister 's spokesman told reporters . Cameron said last year British troops could start leaving Afghanistan in five years , with 1,000 trainers to stay on . Britain plans to make a `` conditions based '' withdrawal and expects its combat troops out of Afghanistan by 2015 . The spokesman said the term `` conditions based '' would not allow wiggle room for an extended stay . `` Conditions based , we are talking about the rate at which it proves possible to transition security to the Afghan security forces ... We will do that by the end of 2014 , '' the spokesman said . `` It is a deadline -- 2015 is a firm deadline . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . So the US withdrawal has already started last year . And as soon as Obama is re-elected US aid to Afghanistan soon will reach zero .

That July 9 secession is the outcome of a January referendum that will see President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and his government in the northern capital Khartoum lose three-quarters of the country 's current oil output , roughly 500,000 barrels per day . Sudan is one of China 's largest foreign supplier of crude oil , making Beijing all the more keen to ensure a smooth transition along the volatile north-south border and that supplies are not interrupted . `` Everyone knows the elephant in the room is China 's investment in Sudan . The security of its interests is a big concern for China , '' said He Wenping , an Africa expert at top government think tank the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences . Khartoum seized the main town in the north-south border region of Abyei on May 21 , raising fears the two sides could return to conflict . But Sudan 's military and the south 's Sudan People 's Liberation Army agreed this week to withdraw forces in favor of Ethiopian peacekeepers . China has made a general policy of not getting involved in other countries ' domestic affairs , but with the security of its oil imports on the line , China says it has already been a force for stability in Sudan . China 's special envoy for Africa Affairs and former envoy to Sudan 's conflict-torn Darfur region , Liu Guijin , told reporters on Thursday that China had `` done a lot of work to persuade '' the north to implement the peace agreement and referendum . Issues concerning Sudan 's security would certainly be on the agenda during Bashir 's trip , which begins on Monday , he added . `` But no matter how strong the outside pressure , no one can replace the Sudanese parties in making a decision , '' Liu said . Fouad Hikmat , a Sudan analyst with the International Crisis Group , said Khartoum was eager to ensure that its relations with China were solid after the split and would likely seek to reassure Beijing that its investments were safe . `` He 's going to have to go and tell China that these investments are not going to be thrown out . They need to maintain friends at the international level , and therefore China is extremely important , '' Hikmat said . The north and south have yet to come to terms on how to manage the oil industry after the split , but China has been increasingly engaging with leaders from south Sudan , where it has opened a consulate and jumped into several projects . Much of the oil comes from the south , but most of the refineries , pipelines and ports are in the north . `` China has a half a dozen projects in the south of Sudan , and as it is fully capable of playing on both sides of the street , '' said Barry Sautman , a professor at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology and an expert on China 's role in Africa . China -- Khartoum 's top arms supplier -- has been criticised by human rights groups ahead of the visit , who have called on Beijing to arrest Bashir for outstanding war crimes charges against him . China has shrugged off these concerns , saying it has every right to invite the head of a state with which it has diplomatic relations . China is in any case not a signatory of the International Criminal Court 's -LRB- ICC -RRB- Rome Statute under which Bashir faces an arrest warrant for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur . Roger Middleton , a researcher at London 's Chatham House think tank , said Bashir 's connections with major powers like China were all the more important because of the charges . `` Politically , it 's very important for Bashir to go abroad to visit a major power . This is certainly more important for Bashir than it is for the Chinese , '' he said of the trip when Bashir will meet his counterpart , President Hu Jintao . Middleton said there was evidence China had in the past pressed Khartoum to `` behave differently , '' but it was unlikely Bashir would get a dressing-down by Chinese officials . The charges against Bashir have not stopped him from crossing borders in the past and other counties , such as India , have oil interests in Sudan , making him far from a pariah . Still , China is an obvious ally for Sudan as a buffer against international pressure because of its U.N. Security Council veto power and its role as Sudan 's top trade partner . Western powers may be less inclined to look the other way over the ICC arrest warrant , but analysts say the United States , also not party to the Rome Statute , and other countries have eased pressure in hopes the secession will go peacefully . `` China is not a member of the ICC and has no legal obligation to implement an ICC decision , '' envoy Liu said . -LRB- This story corrects June 23 story to include missed word in headline -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "130", "dct": "2011-06-24", "dates": ["2011-06-24", "2011-06-24", "2010-01-01", "2011-06-24", "2011-06-19", "2011-01-01", "2010-01-01", "2010-01-01", "2011-06-23", "2011-06-24", "2011-06-24", "2011-06-24"], "text": "VALENCIA , Spain | Fri Jun 24 , 2011 3:06 pm BST VALENCIA , Spain -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Red Bull 's Mark Webber returned to the scene of last year 's spectacular airborne crash on Friday and set the fastest time in first practice for Sunday 's European Formula One Grand Prix .

Run by Nepal 's leading gay rights group , the Blue Diamond Society -LRB- BDS -RRB- , the home and adjoining hospice open to gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transgenders provides shelter to people who have HIV\\/Aids and have been abused and abandoned by their families . `` These people need care and are very late with the treatment . They need to be looked after in their last days of life and even to perform their last rites after death , '' said Sunil Babu Pant , BDS 's founder . `` The families do n't even -LRB- want to -RRB- receive their dead bodies . So the BDS organizes their burial or cremation . '' The shelter , tucked away in a quiet residential area in the outskirts of the Nepali capital , Kathmandu , can accommodate up to 30 people who receive free medical care from doctors , as well as a place to stay . There is no sign board outside the brick-walled compound -- a deliberate attempt , say caretakers , to avoid local attention in a country where many will not even rent their premises to homosexuals . People who visit the shelter are reluctant to talk about their problems , but happy for the support . `` It is a good place for people like us and we get good treatment here , '' said 27-year-old Raju Baral , who tested positive for HIV in 2007 and left home then so he would n't be an embarrassment for his family . Since coming to the shelter , he has gained weight and his health has improved , he added . Nepal , famous for being the home of Mount Everest , is emerging from a decade-long civil war which ended in 2006 and has become more gay-friendly in recent years . In 2007 , the Supreme Court ordered the government to end discrimination against gays and guarantee sexual minorities the same rights as other citizens . Gay beauty contests are held and same-sex marriages are now taking place . Earlier this week , two American women tied the knot as a Hindu priest chanted Vedic hymns in a public religious ceremony outside a major shrine near Kathmandu . There is even a travel agency run by gay men in Nepal , which offers same-sex wedding packages to the world 's tallest peak , as well as to Lumbini , the birthplace of Buddha . A specially elected assembly is now currently drafting the country 's first constitution since the abolition of its monarchy in 2008 , which is expected to guarantee the rights of marginalized groups , including gays and lesbians . `` I think after the restoration of democracy there is a big demand for inclusion of various groups , including the sexual minority , '' said lawyer Sabin Shrestha , who works on gay rights issues . `` Existence of sexual minorities is a reality and we are more and more positive toward their issues compared to earlier days .

The administration reversed its decision on Friday following criticism from the U.S. maritime sector . `` We are dumbfounded by President Obama 's decision to disregard the American maritime industry , which has sufficient capacity to complete this work , '' the American Maritime Partnership said in a statement on Thursday . The Energy Department updated the terms of the oil sale on Friday morning , saying there would no longer be an automatic waiver of the U.S. shipping law .

President Bashar al-Assad 's crackdown on opposition has pushed once-warm ties with Syria close to breaking point . Assad 's increasingly bloody repression of protests has driven 12,000 Syrian refugees to move north and take shelter in camps in Turkey , while Syrian troops move up to seal the area . Ankara has sharpened its rhetoric against Damascus -- publicly nudging Assad to pass reforms and calling his crackdown `` savagery '' -- but analysts say Turkey is still holding out hope for a change of heart in Assad . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Friday a speech by Assad contained `` positive elements in it as signals of reform , '' but said it was important that action followed . `` The Turks seem to be quite worried about a lack of alternatives to a stable regime other than a cruel tyrannical succession , '' said a Western diplomat with knowledge of the Turkish perspective . `` Their last best hope -- although they are not naive -- is that somehow Assad , out of desperation to save his own skin , will undertake meaningful reforms . '' Syria , an ally of Iran , sits at the heart of numerous conflicts in the Middle East . An unstable Syria would have repercussions for Turkey , which also borders Iran and Iraq . `` The fear of the unknown is a major factor , '' said Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul-based security analyst . `` AK is very conservative . It prefers to deal with the devil it knows and Assad is the devil it knows , '' Jenkins said , referring to Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan 's ruling AK Party , which has improved ties with Syria and other Muslim countries . But Turkey could decide to ditch Assad should Syria descend into a civil war between religious and ethnic groupings . Though non-Arab , Turkey 's demographics have similarities with Syria 's . Both have a Sunni majority with Kurdish and Alawite minorities , although Assad 's ruling family are Alawites . `` The strategic , political dimension says that the stability of Syria is vital for the fragile stability of the Middle East , '' Murat Yetkin , editor of the Hurriyet daily , wrote recently . `` But that does n't mean that the current regime will be supported at any cost , because the Baath rule can not produce stability anymore , as it insists on the current policies . '' With refugees pouring across the border , media have reported that Turkish political and military leaders are considering setting up a buffer zone inside Syria in case the number of refugees increases sharply . Officials say they are not aware of such plans . Turkey 's 2nd Army Commander visited the Guvecci border post this week to take stock of Syrian troop deployments near the border and to see the situation of the refugees for himself . Turkey was caught off guard when 500,000 people flooded across the border from Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War , many of them staying for some time after the war . The years that followed saw small contingents of Turkish troops policing what was an effective ` buffer zone ' in the north of Iraq . Having almost gone to war in the late 1990s because of Turkish Kurdish militants using Syria as a sanctuary , Damascus would not welcome the prospect of Turkish boots on Syrian soil . Ankara still faces an insurrection by Kurdish militants seeking their own state in the south-east . Turkey is eager to see borders with Syria , Iran and Iraq that , while open to commerce , are well sealed against rebel infiltration . Jenkins said creating a buffer zone in Syria would carry risks given concerns of Turkish `` neo-Ottoman '' foreign ambitions in some Arab countries , but said Ankara might be forced to it in the case of a mass influx of refugees . `` If we start seeing a spillover that upsets the internal demographic dynamics of Turkey a buffer zone would be possible . The Kurds are the elephant in the room here , '' he said . While Turkey has failed to use its economic leverage to force a change in Damascus -- Turkey is Syria 's largest trading partner -- it is maneuvering to adapt to any fallout . A few months ago , Turkey and Syria were holding joint cabinet meetings and military exercises and abolished visa requirements . Earlier this month , Turkey hosted a conference of Syrian opposition figures in the city of Antalya , and members of the outlawed Syrian Muslim Brotherhood operate out of Turkey . Meanwhile , there have also been early signs of a thaw in frosty relations between Turkey and Israel , Syria 's enemy . Turkish-Israeli ties deteriorated sharply when Israeli commandos stormed a Turkish-backed flotilla bound for Gaza last year , killing nine Turkish activists . `` The policy of warming up to Syria has collapsed , but rather than Turkey reaching a point in which its patience with Assad will snap we will see Turkey finding new margins of maneuver to whatever situation emerges , '' said Semih Idiz , a foreign policy expert for Milliyet daily . The Syrian crisis has also pushed Ankara and Washington into closer cooperation after falling out of step over Iran . Erdogan , who once vacationed together with Assad , and U.S. President Barack Obama have discussed Syria twice by phone recently and share a need for Damascus to implement reforms . Assad 's repression has triggered a gradual escalation of U.S. and European Union economic sanctions against Syrian leaders , but Turks do n't agree on sanctions . `` Turks hate sanctions . Turks suffered greatly under generations of sanctions in Saddam 's Iraq and now with Iran . The last thing Turkey wants is a third country on its eastern border under international sanctions , '' the Western diplomat said . `` They likely would not hesitate to point out to Assad the examples of Saddam and Iran , if he persists in oppressing his own people and defying world opinion .

Pakistan on Monday rejected Afghan allegations it had fired 470 rockets into Afghanistan over the past three weeks , saying only that `` a few accidental rounds '' may have crossed the border when it pursued militants who had attacked its security forces . But the escalation of fighting on the border between Pakistan 's ethnic Pashtun tribal areas and Afghanistan has underscored the difficulties the three countries face in working to reach a political settlement to the 10-year Afghan war . `` I think the main thing on the agenda this time may be the situation on the border , '' said Waheed Mujhda , political analyst at the Afghan Analytical and Advisory Centre in Kabul . The meeting , between U.S. envoy Marc Grossman and top diplomats from Afghanistan and Pakistan , will be the first since President Barack Obama announced a faster-than-expected troop withdrawal last week , accompanied by talks with the Taliban . `` It 's a way to coordinate efforts on reconciliation but also a way for Afghanistan and the U.S. to state clearly to the government of Pakistan ... to end the support by Pakistan of safe havens , '' Grossman told a news conference . Pakistan blames Afghanistan for giving refuge to militants on its side of the border , particularly in eastern Kunar province , leaving it vulnerable to counter-attack when it chases them out of its own tribal areas . Badly bruised after U.S. forces found and killed Osama bin Laden in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad on May 2 , Pakistan is keen to show it has a constructive role to play in helping the United States to bring stability to Afghanistan . It has long wanted the United States to hold talks with the Taliban to seek a political settlement to the Afghan conflict which it says is fuelling its own domestic Islamist insurgency . The United States has come some way towards sharing that view , opening its own preliminary talks with the Taliban . It has also softened its stance on talks by saying its demands that insurgents renounce violence , sever ties with al Qaeda and respect the Afghan constitution are outcomes rather than preconditions for negotiations - a suggestion made last year by Pakistan . `` Strategically the two countries are on same page , '' a senior military official said last month . `` There are issues on operational and tactical levels . '' Karzai has also been pushing for reconciliation with the Taliban and for the first time in the 10-year war , Pakistan , Afghanistan and the United States all share - in theory at least -- a commitment to seek a political settlement . But deep distrust remains , both between the United States and Pakistan and between Afghanistan and Pakistan . Pakistan has so far been excluded from Washington 's early contacts with the Taliban , Grossman told a news conference in Kabul . `` Up to now , the government of Pakistan has not been involved in that particular process at all , as yet . '' Kabul accuses Pakistan of continuing to support the Afghan Taliban , whom it openly backed when they were in power from 1996 to 2001 , to maintain its influence in Afghanistan . It also says Islamabad is trying to manipulate peace talks to its advantage , to the point of sabotaging them if they do not go in the direction it wants . `` We expect practical steps from Pakistan in the weeks and months ahead to help sustain the peace process , '' a senior Afghan government official said . `` The ball is in Pakistan 's court . '' Mujhda , the political analyst , echoed widespread distrust in Kabul of Pakistan 's intentions . `` In each of these meetings the reconciliation issue is raised , promises are made and then the countries go home and nothing is done , '' he said . `` Pakistan has so far opposed attempts by the U.S. to talk to the Taliban . '' The United States is also reluctant to include all insurgents in a political settlement , limiting its talks to the Afghan Taliban led by Mullah Mohammed Omar , but excluding the Haqqani network - the most active group in eastern Afghanistan . It is pushing Pakistan to expand its military operations in its tribal areas to target militants who use them as a base to fight in Afghanistan . Pakistan says its overstretched military will give priority to fighting militants who are killing its own people . With the Taliban talks still at a preliminary stage , and vulnerable to ethnic and regional rivalries which could plunge Afghanistan deeper into civil war as U.S. troops withdraw , the cross-border shelling has added another complication to a fragile situation . The Afghan government said on Sunday that `` it strongly condemned the firing of 470 rockets over the past three weeks from the Pakistan side of the border in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangahar provinces . '' President Hamid Karzai expressed his deep concern , it said , and asked Pakistan to immediately stop firing into Afghanistan . A spokesman for Karzai said on Monday Pakistan 's ambassador to Kabul had been summoned over the issue , though adding : `` we are sure it can be resolved . '' Pakistan army spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said no rounds had been intentionally fired into Afghanistan . In the last month , there had been five major attacks from the Afghan side of the border , in which 55 men in the Pakistani security forces had been killed and 80 wounded . `` The fleeing militants were engaged by the security forces and a few accidental rounds going across can not be ruled out , '' he said . Pakistan says militants , including Pakistani Taliban commanders , have taken refuge on the Afghan side after it launched military operations to drive them out of its Federally Administered Tribal Areas . It was angered by a U.S. decision to thin out its troops in eastern Afghanistan , including the Korengal valley in Kunar province , when Washington decided to concentrate on population centres in southern Afghanistan , the Taliban heartland . `` For quite some time we have been highlighting that there are safe havens across the border , '' Abbas said . `` Something should be done about these . '' Before the killing of bin Laden , the United States had been talking about improving coordination of military operations on both sides of the border so that they could work with , rather than against , each other , in fighting insurgents . That cooperation may have deteriorated in the breakdown of trust which followed the unilateral U.S. raid to get bin Laden , perhaps explaining the escalation in cross-border shelling . It is impossible to verify independently exactly what is happening on the remote mountainous border .

Four months after Bahrain 's Sunni Muslim rulers quashed pro-democracy protests led by the Shi'ite majority , King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa has set July 2 as the start of a national dialogue to discuss economic , political and social reforms . The opposition has said only deep political reform , not mere dialogue , can permanently end popular unrest . `` The government needs to develop progressive solutions . This crisis is political , '' Radhi al-Mousawi told Reuters in an interview . `` Without a permanent solution to reforming the constitutional monarchy , the crisis will return in a few years . '' Mainstream opposition groups such as Waad seek a more representative parliament with legislative powers that are not weakened by an upper Shura council appointed by the king . The government has said all types of political , economic and social reform can be discussed but the opposition is suspicious that the wide variety of issues will diminish the chances of agreeing on real democratisation . Participants in the dialogue will send their proposals for approval to Bahrain 's ruling family at the end of the talks . Waad , a secular leftist party run by Sunnis and Shi'ites alike , was the worst-hit during unrest this year . Both of its offices were set ablaze and the government banned its operations , a decision it reversed just last week . Waad members believe their non-sectarian voice made them a target by hardliners in support of the government , who they accuse of stoking sectarian tensions in the Gulf island kingdom . `` The government can not gain victory over people by sewing sectarian divisions . Sectarianism could destroy us . The wars in Lebanon and Iraq have shown us that , '' Mousawi said as he examined the charred walls of Waad 's offices in Manama . Mousawi has led Waad in the stead of Ibrahim Sharif , the party 's Sunni , secular leader who was sentenced to five years in prison last week on charges of assisting a `` foreign terrorist group '' in a coup plot . Eight prominent hardline Shi'ite opposition leaders received life in prison . Bahrain , which crushed demonstrations calling for democracy in March , accuses the opposition of a sectarian agenda and backing by Shi'ite power Iran , charges that Shi'ite groups deny and Waad said was contradicted by its secular approach . Some hardline parties had called for abolition of the monarchy , but Waad and its Shi'ite political ally Wefaq , the opposition 's largest bloc , stuck to calls for democratic reforms to Bahrain 's constitutional monarchy . That has not stopped government loyalists from accusing Wefaq of taking direct orders from Iran and Waad of accepting such plans for political gain , accusations both groups deny . Opposition groups say that to have its ban lifted , Waad was coerced into accepting the national dialogue and apologising publicly for criticising Bahrain 's invitation of Saudi and United Arab Emirates troops to help it crack down on protests . `` We paid the price with certain concessions in a statement last week in order to reopen , '' Mousawi said . `` But we felt it was important to do it so we could get back to work . '' Authorities last week handed back the keys to Waad 's burnt-out headquarters , which the party is now renovating . Mousawi warned Waad was ready to withdraw if democratic reforms to the monarchy were not addressed . Opposition parties complain the dialogue dilutes their voice -- they have only 35 of 300 seats at the talks . `` This was not the dialogue we imagined , we wanted direct talks between the government and the opposition , '' said Mousawi . `` If there is no serious move on political reform , we will walk . '' Mousawi criticised Bahraini officials ' arguments that the opposition must be patient as reforms are implemented gradually in Bahrain , which they say is new to democratic reforms compared to established constitutional monarchies in Britain or Denmark . Mousawi said : `` The people are ready for democracy now ... No country can progress if over half its population feels it is marginalised .

Wen said he was confident Britain and China could achieve their goal of doubling bilateral trade to $ 100 billion by 2015 , but he also noted that Britain was slipping behind other European Union countries in its volume of trade with China . Wen is visiting Hungary , Britain and Germany in a rapid tour of Europe , where countries are looking for Chinese support to help lift them out of the financial crisis , whether by increasing trade or by buying government bonds . As Greece teeters on the brink of default , Beijing is seeking to safeguard its vast holdings of euro-denominated assets and to preserve trade growth with the European Union , its largest trading partner . Cameron welcomed Wen 's commitment to rebalancing China 's economy by stimulating domestic demand and reducing its foreign trade surplus and said both Britain and China must continue to make the case for open markets . Cameron and Wen made clear they did not see completely eye-to-eye on human rights and the Libya conflict . `` We believe that the development of civil society , freedom of expression , the rule of law and respect for human rights underpin stability and prosperity for us all , '' Cameron said . Wen , who is known to have reformist tendencies , responded that China and Britain should engage in `` more cooperation than finger-pointing '' on human rights . But he also said he was confident that `` tomorrow 's China will not only enjoy economic prosperity but also -LRB- an -RRB- improved democracy and legal system . '' China has clamped down heavily on dissent this year , arresting scores of activists to smother scattered online calls for an Arab-style `` Jasmine revolution , '' though it released prominent artist and activist Ai Weiwei last week and prominent dissident Hu Jia on Sunday . Wen made some pointed remarks about the Libyan conflict , where Britain has played a leading role in attacking leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . `` Foreign troops may be able to win war ... but they can hardly win peace , '' he said . Cameron said it was essential China respected intellectual property and patents , an issue often cited by foreign companies operating there . China and Britain had agreed to hold a symposium on intellectual property later this year , he said . Wen 's visit is the latest of several recent high-level diplomatic exchanges between Britain and China , including a visit to China by Cameron last November , part of a drive to boost Britain 's economic recovery by lifting exports to emerging markets .

Senior Russian officials , who have thwarted Western attempts to condemn Assad for crushing protests against his rule , held a meeting with some of Assad 's most vociferous critics in Moscow . The meeting was seen as a possible sign the Kremlin might be hedging its bets and trying to ensure its clout in the Middle Eastern country if Assad is toppled . Russia 's foreign ministry said the Syrian opposition representatives came at the invitation of a regional cooperation society and that no official meetings were planned . Rights groups say 1,300 civilians have been killed during a three-month revolt against the Assad family 's 41-year rule , partly inspired by uprisings across the Arab world . Syrian authorities say more than 250 soldiers and police have died in clashes they say were provoked by militant groups . `` Russia should help Syria to reach freedom and democracy by putting more pressure on the Syrian President to resign , '' Mulhem Droubi , a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood , told journalists . `` The president should resign if he has any feeling for Syrian people , '' he said after talks with the Kremlin 's special envoy for Africa , Mikhail Margelov . Russia has urged Assad to move faster on promised reforms , but has opposed Western efforts to condemn his crackdown in the U.N. Security Council and echoed his claims that extremists are to blame for some of the violence . Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who most diplomats believe is Russia 's paramount leader , tried to play down Moscow 's ties with Syria last week , saying that Russia had no special relationship with Damascus . Putin said any leader of a nation plagued by unrest should face international pressure to stop the bloodshed . `` Russia has only one friend - the Syrian people , '' Margelov , told reporters after the talks . About 50 Assad supporters held a demonstration outside a news conference given by the Syrian opposition on Tuesday . Margelov , appointed by Medvedev to mediate in North Africa and the Middle East , said Russia wanted political dialogue to prevent Syria from following the path of Libya , which has descended into civil war . The Syrian activists , based in Russia and other countries , said Russia had to correct its policy toward Assad . `` Russia should be on the right side of history , otherwise it will be much harder for it to build relations -LRB- with Syria -RRB- in the future , '' Russia 's Kommersant newspaper quoted delegation leader Radwan Ziadeh , head of the Damascus Center for Human Rights , as saying . `` By opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria , Russia is supporting a criminal regime , '' he said . Syria 's government has announced it will invite opposition figures to July 10 talks to set the framework for a dialogue promised by Assad , and that constitutional changes would be on the agenda .

We do not think there is anything else capable of solving the crisis in Syria , '' said Fateh Jamous , who spent some 19 years in jail as a dissident . `` But before the dialogue we need some practical moves on the ground ... so that the side which is holding talks does not look like it is doing that against the popular movement , '' he added , speaking by phone from Damascus . Other opposition figures believe Assad has already squandered opportunities for reform , saying it is too late for the national dialogue he has promised and he must leave now . `` This regime has lost its legitimacy . I do not see any reason in talking to it . He must go and we will choose our way after him . He must go first , '' said one secular activist in Damascus , who asked not to be named for his own safety . Even many who believe in dialogue say they can not talk with the authorities while the crackdown on protesters continues . `` What we want is a democratic change in the structure of the regime , which means changes in laws , institutions -- all the issues of the past 40 to 50 years to be dealt with , '' said Jamous , a senior official of Syria 's Communist Labor party . Louay Hussein , a writer who was detained during this year 's protests and took part in the opposition conference in Damascus on Monday which called for democratic change , said authorities must prepare the right atmosphere for talks . `` Before any dialogue all detainees must be released , the crackdown must end , and the opposition must be allowed a voice in state media , '' he said . Western governments have condemned Assad 's violence against protesters , but their practical response has so far been limited to sanctions against top officials , a far cry from the military intervention against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya . Assad 's response to the protests has also included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds , lifting a draconian state of emergency , freeing hundreds of prisoners and calling for a national dialogue . Protests , triggered by anger and frustration at corruption , poverty and lack of freedoms , have been mainly peaceful , though rights groups say the death toll among protesters is over 1,300 and that 12,000 people have been detained . Assad 's adviser Bouthaina Shaaban said on Tuesday that 500 soldiers and police had been killed . Activists say that at least some of the dead soldiers were killed by their own superiors for disobeying orders to stop protests . Syria has imposed restrictions on media , including expelling journalists , making it hard to verify accounts of violence . Although the secular opposition shared a common goal of democracy and opposes foreign intervention , years of oppression under Assad 's late father , Hafez al-Assad , have fragmented this loose grouping of liberals , Arab nationalists and Kurds . A high-profile alliance which in 2005 produced what it called the Damascus Declaration calling for peaceful reform has done little as a group since this year 's protests broke out . Operating largely separately has been the banned Islamist Muslim Brotherhood . Dominated by exiles since the elder Assad crushed an armed revolt by the group in the city of Hama in 1982 , it still has potential to be a major force among those in the Sunni majority keen to throw off domination by Assad 's minority Alawite sect . Membership is still punishable by death . Most veteran opposition figures have spent years in prison . Many have been jailed several times . In the past year , Syria 's intelligence agents have worked tirelessly to divide the various opposition groups , playing on their rivalries to plant seeds of doubt among them and leaving a legacy of suspicion still evident in their responses to an uprising that seems to have started as a spontaneous reaction among ordinary people to the overthrow of other Arab leaders . When the Syrian protests erupted in March , triggered by local grievances in the southern city of Deraa , the disparate opposition failed to take a lead , leaving the way open for a new form of activism , inspired by Egypt 's successful revolution . Young people set up local coordination committees which were active on the streets , made contact with media organizations banned from reporting in Syria and made use of mobile phone footage and social media to promote their cause . `` The street opposition was born and is now playing the main role in calling for the change , '' said Aref Dalila , a prominent economist and activist who spent years in prison . He dropped out of this week 's meeting in Damascus at the last minute . The conference won a guarded welcome from Assad 's toughest critics in Western governments , but another prominent opposition figure in Damascus who refused to take part said it might have helped polish the authorities ' image and harmed their opponents . `` We feel it might have been used ... to minimize the extent of opposition and to suggest it was limited only to those who came to the meeting , '' said the man , another formerly jailed dissident . Despite three months of street demonstrations , in which tens of thousands have braved violence to challenge Assad 's rule , most of the 22 million Syrians have stayed on the sidelines and the main cities of Damascus and Aleppo have seen fewer protests . While Assad 's promise of dialogue is unlikely to sway the committed protesters it might send a positive signal to the `` silent majority '' which has not taken to the streets , either from fear of repression or concern about chaos if Assad goes . Fayez Sara , a liberal writer who attended the meeting in Damascus , said it had been an important achievement which helped bring different views together . He hoped it could be repeated in the provinces : '' -LRB- It was a -RRB- breakthrough in the work of the opposition , which has been deprived of meeting and organizing events for the past 50 years , '' said Sara . It was not the first time this year an opposition conference has been met with skepticism . When a group of activists and opposition parties met in Turkey last month critics among their fellow Syrian dissidents described it as an attempt to encourage foreign powers to intervene in their country . That exposed another fault line in opposition ranks , between activists in exile who have been lobbying the international community to make a stand against Assad , and those still in the country who mostly insist that Syrians solve their own problems . `` The opposition outside does not represent us at all . We are against any external intervention , because we believe it will only be motivated by interests and political forces which have a different view from those within the nation , '' said Jamous . Some activists who favor dialogue with Assad said they have come under pressure from others who question their loyalties . `` Some are saying ... ` you are doing the authorities a favor ' and ` it is a betrayal of the blood the people have shed in the streets ' , '' said one man in Damascus , who said he got angry messages on Facebook which all but called him a traitor . `` It is nonsense . In order to save the blood of the people we should talk , '' he said . `` The sense of responsibility is still weak among many opposition groups . Some fear the intimidation , and they are doing nothing because they fear that this or that person will say something bad about them . '' His views were echoed by several activists across Syria . Many stressed the country 's potentially volatile religious and ethnic mix as a powerful reason for promoting dialogue , to reduce the risk of violence from any sudden shift in power . Analysts say that communities of Sunni Muslim Arabs -- by far the biggest group -- Kurds , Alawites and Christians , could slip into civil war as Assad increasingly relies on his fellow Alawites , both regular and militia forces , to hold on to power . `` I think now the crisis is heading toward a dangerous road and I hope that it will averted , '' Jamous said . `` All sides should make compromises : the regime , which is responsible for what is happening , and the opposition and those elements on the street which have called for the overthrow of the regime without thinking of the alternative and how to fill the vacuum . `` We want a transitional period during which safe and transparent elections take place .

After six years of negotiations , marred by EU concerns over slow judiciary reforms and Croatia 's approach to its war-time past , the ex-Yugoslav state ended work on the final policy areas in which its laws needed to be adjusted to EU rules . Its anti-graft efforts will continue to face EU scrutiny , however , while its accession treaty is being drafted in Brussels in the coming months and parliaments throughout the bloc ratify it . This may threaten Croatia 's aim of joining the world 's largest economic and trade bloc in July 2013 , if reform progress is disappointing and lawmakers stall , EU diplomats say . `` We were able to wake up the political will , but that 's not the end of the road , '' one EU diplomat said . `` The ratification process could be a mess . '' Hungary 's Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi , who oversaw negotiations with Croatia during Budapest 's six-month EU presidency that ends Thursday , offered assurances that the bloc 's 27 governments aimed to admit it in two years . `` If everything goes well , Croatia will be a member in July 2013 , '' he told a news conference in Brussels . In the meantime , EU policymakers will monitor Zagreb 's ability to ensure the independence of judges and its track record in putting corrupt officials behind bars , seeking reassurances that democratic change is genuine . The worry among some EU members is that Croatia could follow in the footsteps of Romania and Bulgaria , which backtracked on anti-graft reforms after their accession in 2007 . Their failure to stay on track -- and concerns over the cost of EU expansion at a time of economic difficulties in many European countries -- had been a major factor behind a growing reluctance among EU voters to admit new members in recent years . In Croatia , which would be one of the EU 's poorest countries once admitted , policymakers are hoping for an economic boost from EU aid after accession and a rebound in foreign investment , decimated throughout the region by global woes . Support for EU membership is on the rise in Croatia , but many people still fret about giving access to its lucrative island tourism to foreign investors . Croats are also frustrated by pressure from the West to come to terms with their role in the Balkan wars in the 1990s . But EU policymakers hope by admitting the country of 4.4 million people they can rejuvenate enthusiasm towards the EU throughout the Western Balkans and kick-start stalled reforms . Having large swathes of its neighboring Balkans mired in ethnic strife and political infighting that block democratic reforms is an embarrassment to Europe as it tries to assert its global clout and pro-reform credentials . `` This represents the achievement of a historic goal for Croatia ... -LRB- and -RRB- shows the way for other countries of the region in pursuing their European future , '' Britain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said in statement . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed what she called an important milestone and said in a statement : `` The conclusion of accession talks for Croatia creates a positive momentum which I hope will spread throughout the region . '' One country in the region hoping for progress is Serbia , which wants EU governments to agree to start EU talks over the next year . Its bid got a boost in May when Belgrade apprehended wartime general Ratko Mladic , wanted by a U.N. tribunal on genocide chargers . `` The more countries from the region enter the EU , the better is the perception -LRB- in the west -RRB- about other countries here , '' said Milica Delevic , who oversees Belgrade 's EU bid .

Defying Assad 's military crackdown , demonstrators took to the streets again after Friday prayers across the country , from towns near the western Lebanese border to the desert regions near Iraq in the east . `` Bashar get out of our lives , '' read placards carried by thousands of Kurds who marched in the northeastern city of Amouda , according to a YouTube video taken by resident . Encouraged by the widening protests , prominent opposition figures plan to convene a ` national salvation ' conference in Damascus on July 16 to reach a broad based blueprint for solving Syria 's political crisis . `` In light of the military solution chosen by the regime to end the revolution , the conference aims to reach a consensus guided by the popular protest movement for a transitional period and a national salvation government that lays the foundation for a new constitution and free elections , '' said a statement by the organizers , which was sent to Reuters . The statement was signed by 50 figures , including Kurdish leader Mishaal al-Tammo , former judge Haitham al-Maleh , Nawaf al-Bashir , a tribal leader from the eastern province of Deir al-Zor , economist Aref Dalila , a fierce critic of the Assad 's family 's involvement in business and Walid al-Bunni , a physician who played a major role in a movement for democracy crushed by Assad ten years ago known as Damascus Spring . With an intensifying security campaign that rights campaigners said resulted in arbitrary arrests of over 1,000 people over the last week alone , organizers said the conference would be far more difficult to convene than a meeting of intellectuals allowed by the authorities last week that gave a rare platform to several opposition figures . Lawyer Razan Zaitouna told Reuters by phone that the 24 dead included seven protesters in the central city of Homs , scene of widening protests against Assad and 14 villagers in the northwestern province of Idlib , where troops backed by tanks and helicopters have been storming villages to subdue dissent . The assaults concentrated on the northern section of Jabal al-Zawya region , home to 15,000 people , many of whom are trying to flee to Turkey , which already has 10,000 refugees from attacks in Idlib earlier this month . `` Troops have heavily blocked the roads leading out of Jabal al-Zawya and only tens of people have made it to Turkey . The roads are also dangerous because there is random gunfire from helicopters and tanks , '' a resident of the region said . In the city of Hama , video footage appeared to show tens of thousands of protesters massed in a central square . Witnesses and activists said demonstrators in Hama and in Kurdish eastern areas carried red cards , employing a soccer symbol to demand Assad 's `` sending off . '' Authorities have banned most international media from operating in Syria since the outbreak of the protests in March , making it difficult to verify reports from activists and authorities . State television said gunmen had fired on security forces in Homs in several other towns , wounding two of them . In the old Homs district of Bab Sbaa , a witness said several armored vehicles deployed and soldiers fired at protesters from road blocks set up in main streets in the city of one million . Another activist in Homs said troops surrounded a private hospital in Bab Sbaa and several wounded people rushed to another hospital on the outskirts of the city where security forces were not present . ASSAD `` RUNNING OUT OF TIME '' Protesters have taken to the streets for 14 weeks to protest against Assad in unrest which has claimed the lives of around 1,300 civilians , with security forces arresting over 12,000 people and shooting security personnel who refused to fire on civilians , according to rights groups . Authorities say 500 police and soldiers have been killed by gunmen they also blame for most of the civilian deaths . Alongside the military crackdown , Assad has promised a national dialogue on political reforms . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was `` disheartened '' by reports of continued violence near the Syrian border with Turkey . Monday 's meeting in Damascus , she said , was not enough on its own to address demands for reform . `` It is absolutely clear that the Syrian government is running out of time , '' she said during a visit to Lithuania . `` They are either going to allow a serious political process that will include peaceful protests to take place throughout Syria and engage in a productive dialogue with members of the opposition and civil society , or they 're going to continue to see increasingly organized resistance . '' Around 100 people crossed over into Lebanon early on Friday , witnesses said . Thousands have fled to Lebanon during the three months of unrest , but many have returned and it is unclear how many remain in Lebanon . Syrian television showed a pro-Assad demonstration of around 100 people in the northern city of Aleppo on Friday , and state media reported several other large gatherings organized by the authorities on Thursday which they said expressed support for Assad 's proposed reforms . The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on Assad and his top officials in response to the violent repression of the protests . On Wednesday the U.S. Treasury Department said it was also imposing sanctions against Syria 's security forces for human rights abuses and against Iran for supporting them . The Treasury named the four major branches of Syria 's security forces and said any assets they may have subject to U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen and that Americans are barred from any dealings with them . Damascus and Tehran both deny Western accusations that Iran has supported the crackdown on Syrian protesters .

Full Article FEATURE - British veterans of Spain 's Civil War honored LONDON | Sun Jul 3 , 2011 2:33 pm IST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Their spirit and convictions undiminished by age , British veterans of the Spanish Civil War were honored this weekend at a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the epic conflict . The International Brigades fought for the Republican side against fascism . And though General Francisco Franco won the 1936-39 war , the deaths of their colleagues was not vain and the eventual return of democracy in Spain had made it all worthwhile , speakers said . The event took place at the International Brigade Memorial in a park by the River Thames in London . Relatives and supporters of veterans raised one-fisted salutes , laid wreaths and sang songs of solidarity . The guests of honor were David Lomon and Thomas Watters , two of only four known British volunteers still living . `` I was Jewish , I was an anti-fascist . Hitler and Mussolini were all over Europe . Mosley was stirring up trouble in London . I had to do something , '' said Lomon , now aged 93 , of his decision to join the International Brigades . The war broke out on July 18 , 1936 , with a military uprising against the reformist Republican government . Franco was supported by Hitler and Mussolini . Russia aided the Republicans but Britain and other powers followed a non-intervention policy . But some 35,000 British , American and other nationalities joined the brigades , many of them dockers , miners or other workers who saw Spain as the frontline against a global threat . Lomon told Reuters he volunteered just after his 18th birthday through the Anti-Communist League and was given a train ticket to Paris . From there he was taken to the French-Spanish border , walked over the Pyrenees into Spain , and after a few weeks training found himself at the frontline manning a Maxim machinegun . `` It was scary . It was an education for me , '' he said . `` The people were so wonderful . The peasants suffered but they helped us so much , they made it all worthwhile . '' `` I fell in love with Spain . It was worth fighting for , '' he said , dapper and still sharp-minded at the age of 93 . Lomon was captured by Italian troops during the Republican retreat of 1938 and spent several months in a prison camp until he was repatriatad . `` When I came back I decided I would carry on the fight . '' With the outbreak of World War Two , he joined the Royal Navy and served on minesweepers in the English Channel and Asia . Watters , 98 , served with the Scottish Ambulance Unit . Born in Alloa , he trained as a medic while working as a bus driver in Glasgow and his main motivation was to help people . `` I had to go . There were many wounded . They asked for volunteers and I had to do it . I was n't political , '' he told Reuters . He was at the Battle of Jarama in February 1937 , where both sides suffered huge casualties . After two years in Spain , he returned to his job on the buses . Last week , the British government released intelligence files that said about 4,000 British and Irish men and women joined the anti-fascist fight , some 1,500 more than previously thought . Around 500 are known to have been killed . Britain 's MI5 spy agency kept records on them into the 1950s due to its fears of their possible communist links . Among then were Eric Blair , better known as George Orwell , who wrote about his experiences in `` Homage to Catalonia '' , and author Laurie Lee . In the decades since the conflict , it has become a reference point for many other foreign interventions and civil wars , particularly during the Central American wars of the 1980s . This year British Labor Party leader Ed Miliband and Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd both evoked it when calling for international action in support of Libyan rebels . Cuba 's Fidel Castro compared the NATO bombings to the German and Italian support for Franco . And as the anniversary nears , the war is still controversial in Spain , which has been wary of reopening old wounds . Peter Preston , regarded as the war 's leading historian , said in remarks at the ceremony organised by the International Brigade Memorial Trust that after the war , Franco `` brainwashed '' people into thinking he stood for freedom . Recent attempts to account for the thousands of dead from extra-judicial killings during and after the conflict had been stymied , he said , noting the removal from office by the conservative judiciary of investigating judge Baltasar Garzon . `` The struggle continues , '' Preston said , quoting the Republican rallying cry . Still , a Spanish diplomat attended the ceremony and praised the foreign veterans . `` Their solidarity , their generosity , their courage and their decency is an example to the younger generation , '' said Fidel Lopez Alvarez , cultural counsellor at the Spanish Embassy . In 2007 , Spain passed a law giving citizenship to the veterans . Lomon said he had received his passport two weeks ago . `` You deserve it , '' Lopez Alvarez told him . -LRB- Reporting by Angus MacSwan ; Editing by Michael Roddy ; -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "347", "dct": "2011-07-03", "dates": ["2011-07-02", "2011-07-03", "2011-07-03", "2011-07-03", "2011-07-03", "2011-07-01", "2011-06-27", "2011-06-01", "2011-07-01", "2011-07-01", "2011-07-02", "2011-07-01"], "text": "A rebel prepares his improvised 68mm rocket launcher on the front line , in the village of Kikla , which lies approximately 150 km -LRB- 93 miles -RRB- south of the capital Tripoli , July 2 , 2011 .

In an address relayed to some 100,000 supporters in Tripoli 's Green Square on Friday , Gaddafi urged NATO to halt its bombing campaign or risk seeing Libyan fighters descend on Europe `` like a swarm of locusts or bees . '' `` Retreat , you have no chance of beating this brave people , '' Gaddafi said . `` They can attack your homes , your offices and your families , which will become military targets just as you have transformed our offices , headquarters , houses and children into what you regard as legitimate military targets , '' he said . NATO announced it had stepped up strikes on Gaddafi forces in west Libya including the capital Tripoli , saying it had carried out more than 50 attacks since Monday . Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said the alliance stance was unchanged . `` Spain 's and the international coalition 's response is to maintain the unity and determination with which we have been working these past months , '' she said . Libyan rebels who had advanced to within 80 km of the capital were stopped in their tracks on Friday by a barrage of rocket fire from government forces , underlining the dogged resistance of Gaddafi troops to a five-month revolt . '' -LRB- It -RRB- was obviously a strategic withdrawal because of the battlefield situation and the amount of bombardment that the revolutionary forces were receiving , '' said rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani . `` But we hope to counter that within the next 48 hours . '' In Tripoli , a senior source in Gaddafi 's government said there was reliable intelligence indicating the rebels were planning to attack oil export terminals in the eastern towns of Brega and Ras Lanuf . `` The Libyan government will do whatever -LRB- possible -RRB- to prevent such attacks , '' the source , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters . `` It urges international oil companies as well as international insurance companies to put pressure on their governments to force the rebels , who are supported by NATO , to stop their destructive operations , '' Coalition military officials refuse to characterise the situation on the ground as a stalemate after a 104-day bombing campaign that has strained alliance firepower and tested unity , with internal divisions over strategy surfacing . Analysts say part of NATO 's strategy is to use the attacks to hinder efforts by authorities to put down any future uprising in Tripoli . Britain 's Defense Ministry said Apache helicopters hit three tanks and a bunker firing position in an attack on an army camp west of Tripoli late on Friday . Libyan state TV said NATO also bombed the central Al-Jufrah region on Saturday . A document seen by Reuters showed African Union leaders had agreed on Friday that member states would not execute the arrest warrant for Gaddafi , leaving open the possibility that he could go into exile in one of the African Union 's 53 nations . The grouping also offered to host talks on a cease-fire and a transition to democratic government , but did not call on Gaddafi to step down and left open whether he had a future role . Mansour Sayf al Nasr , the rebels ' representative in France , told reporters at the summit in Equatorial Guinea : `` We understood that the spirit of the document is that Gaddafi will not have a role to play in the future of Libya . '' Abdel-Hafiz Ghoga , vice president of the Benghazi-based rebel council , told Reuters : `` We reject the African Union proposal because it includes nothing concerning our demands . We are only demanding one thing : Gaddafi 's resignation ... We can gain freedom and democracy only if Gaddafi steps down . `` I think we can obtain freedom only through military operations and we will be able to do this . '' In Tripoli , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim did not comment on whether any AU-hosted negotiations should start on the assumption that Gaddafi would step down , saying only : `` We have been saying for months that we will have talks with all parties .

BEIRUT | Wed Jul 6 , 2011 12:43 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian forces rounded up dozens of people around Hama on Wednesday , a day after shooting dead 22 people , activists said , and Amnesty International said Syria may have committed crimes against humanity in an earlier crackdown . Tanks were still stationed outside Hama , which has seen some of the biggest protests against President Bashar al-Assad and was the site of a bloody crackdown against Islamist insurgents nearly 30 years ago . But some of the tanks were redeployed away from the city and a resident said security forces were concentrated around the headquarters of the ruling Baath Party , the police headquarters and a state security compound . Most arrests took place in the outskirts of the city . Ammar Qurabi , Cairo-based head of the Syrian National Human Rights Organization , said the death toll from Tuesday , when gunmen loyal to Assad swept through the city , had risen to 22 . He said hundreds of people had been arrested . Rami Adbelrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 23 people had died in Hama in the last 24 hours , and that an opposition figure in the city had reported water and electricity supplies were cut to the city on Wednesday morning . State news agency SANA said one policeman had been killed in a clash with armed groups who opened fire on security forces and threw petrol and nail bombs at them . It made no mention of civilian deaths but said some `` armed men '' were injured . Syria has prevented most independent media from operating inside the country , making it difficult to verify accounts from activists and authorities . Hama was emptied of security forces for nearly a month after at least 60 protesters were shot dead on June 3 , but the security vacuum emboldened demonstrators and on Friday activists said at least 150,000 people rallied to demand Assad 's downfall . The next day Assad sacked the provincial governor and sent tanks and troops to surround the city , signaling a military assault similar to those carried out in other protest centers . In a report released on Wednesday , Amnesty International said the crackdown two months ago against one of those protest centers -- the town of Tel Kelakh near the border with Lebanon -- may have constituted a crime against humanity . Urging the United Nations to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court , it said nine people died in custody after being captured during the operation in the town , close to the Lebanese border . Describing a `` devastating security operation '' , it said scores of men were rounded up , and most of them were tortured . Some detainees told Amnesty they were beaten and tied by the wrists to a bar high enough off the ground to force them to stand on the tip of their toes for long periods -- known as the shabah , meaning ghost , position . A 22-year-old man told Amnesty he was tied up in the shabah position had electric shocks applied to his body and testicles during five days of detention in the provincial capital Homs . `` Amnesty International considers that crimes committed in Tel Kelakh amount to crimes against humanity as they appear to be part of a widespread , as well as systematic , attack against the civilian population , '' it said . Syrian activists say security forces have killed more than 1,300 civilians since the unrest erupted 14 weeks ago . Authorities say 500 soldiers and police have been killed by armed gangs who they also blame for most of the civilian deaths . Assad has responded to the protests with a mixture of repression and concessions , promising a political dialogue with the opposition . Preliminary talks on the dialogue are due to be held on Sunday . But opposition figures refuse to sit down and talk while the killings and arrests continue , and diplomats say events in Hama will be a litmus test for whether Assad chooses to focus on a political or a military solution to the unrest . Some residents sought to halt any military advance earlier this week by blocking roads between neighborhoods with rubbish containers , burning tyres , wood and metal . The New York-based group Human Rights Watch -LRB- HRW -RRB- said it had been told by an official at Hama 's Hourani hospital that security forces surrounded the hospital on Tuesday , although they did not enter it , as it received the bodies of four people and treated 60 others with gunshot wounds . `` Security forces have responded to protest with the brutality that 's become familiar over the past several months . '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , HRW 's Middle East director . Assad 's father , Hafez al-Assad , who ruled Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000 , sent troops into Hama in 1982 to crush an Islamist-led uprising in the city where the armed wing of the Muslim Brotherhood made its last stand . That attack killed many thousands , possibly up to 30,000 , and one slogan shouted by Hama protesters in recent weeks was `` Damn your soul , Hafez '' .

City clerk 's offices in the five boroughs of New York normally are closed on weekends , but Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that for this special occasion they will be open . `` This is a historic moment for New York , a moment many couples have waited years and even decades to see -- and we are not going to make them wait one day longer than they have to , '' Bloomberg said in a statement . City Clerk Michael McSweeney added that his office expected `` large numbers of people on the first day . '' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo last month signed the state 's Marriage Equality Act into law , making the state the sixth and most populous in the United States to allow gay marriage . Earlier this week , same-sex couples eager to marry in New York hit a bureaucratic snag when marriage license applications made available to them still used the terms `` bride '' and `` groom . '' But the forms were later changed to include the terms `` Spouse A '' and `` Spouse B. '' State law generally requires couples to wait 24 hours after receiving a marriage license before they can wed. . But on Sunday , July 24 , state judges will volunteer to perform ceremonies and review requests for waivers of the 24-hour waiting period , according to the mayor 's office . The New York city clerk 's offices will be open two hours later than usual for the first five weekdays after the same-sex marriage bill goes into effect to accommodate what is expected to be heavy demand from same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses and civil ceremonies . When a California Supreme Court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in June 2008 , the state saw a spike in marriage licenses issued , as gay and lesbian couples lined up to wed at municipal offices . California voters later banned gay marriages by approving a constitutional amendment in the November 2008 election . -LRB- Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis .

Tens of thousands of Gaddafi supporters rallied in Tripoli 's Green Square for Friday prayers , underscoring his refusal to step down after four decades in power and five months of fighting . Large numbers also turned out in the desert town of Sabha , 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- to the south in an apparent attempt to show that Gaddafi still enjoys support in the areas of Libya he still controls . In a speech on Libyan television , Gaddafi threatened to send hundreds of Libyans to carry out attacks in Europe in revenge for the NATO-led military campaign against him . `` Hundreds of Libyans will martyr in Europe . I told you it is eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth . But we will give them a chance to come to their senses , '' the Libyan leader said in an audio speech . While the insurgents have advanced on two fronts in the past two weeks , they took casualties on Friday . At least six rebels were killed and 17 injured on the front line near Misrata , on Libya 's Mediterranean coast , according to local medical workers . Rebels there came under heavy artillery fire from Gaddafi 's forces and a Reuters team near the front saw a mortar shell land near a rebel unit . Five members of the rebel unit were wounded , two seriously . One fighter 's fingers were partly severed and left hanging from his hand after the explosion . A rebel sympathiser in Misrata told Reuters opposition forces had been moving closer to neighbouring Zlitan , one of a chain of government-controlled towns blocking their advance to Tripoli . As they advanced , pro-Gaddafi troops inside the city fired rounds of explosives to block their progress , the sympathiser said in an e-mail . `` The rebels are waiting for NATO backup or for Gaddafi forces to run out of ammunition to make a move to take the city center , '' he said . On the other major front , in the Western Mountains region southwest of Tripoli , NATO warplanes bombed forces loyal to Gaddafi several times in mid-afternoon , their bombs landing about 3 km -LRB- 2 miles -RRB- east of the village of Al-Qawalish , according to one rebel fighter . After weeks of static fighting , the rebels made significant advances on Wednesday : pushing west from Misrata to within 13 km -LRB- 8 miles -RRB- of Zlitan , where large numbers of pro-Gaddafi forces are based , and seizing the village of Al-Qawalish in the southwest . Taking Al-Qawalish brings them closer to having control of a major highway into the capital . Rebel advances over the last two weeks have allowed normal life to resume in towns no longer in shelling distance of Gaddafi 's troops . Rebels staged a military parade on Friday evening in Zintan , one of the main towns in the Western Mountains . Scores of children thronged the streets to watch the rebels drive through on tanks . People fired rifles in the air including one small boy who opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle while perched on his father 's shoulders . Tens of thousands of Gaddafi supporters and tribal leaders rallied in Tripoli 's Green Square for Friday prayers and a sermon predicting a swift end to the rebellion . Preacher Ali Abu-Sowah told thousands of worshippers Libya could implement reform without the intervention of the West and accused the rebels of being Western stooges . `` How can we allow such meddling when we see what happened in beloved Iraq and Afghanistan ? '' In Sabha , the biggest town in southern Libya , organisers said 250,000 people representing most of the tribes of the south turned out to show support for Gaddafi . Britain , one of the main backers of the campaign against Gaddafi , predicted that `` the writing is on the wall '' for the Libyan leader . `` I think it 's heading towards a clear conclusion -- eventually , we do n't know when that will be , when Colonel Gaddafi realizes that his departure is essential to the future of Libya and its people , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague told Reuters in an interview on Friday . `` I think the pressure on the regime is increasing all the time . We have intensified the military campaign , it will be intensified further . The economic pressure is intensifying also , and so is the diplomatic pressure , '' he said during a visit to Addis Ababa . In what may be the latest financial squeeze on Gaddafi , Turkey has frozen $ 1 billion of Libyan central bank reserves deposited in its banks , a Turkish newspaper reported on Friday .

Credit : Reuters\\/David Hume Kennerly\\/Courtesy Gerald R. Ford Library\\/Handout LOS ANGELES | Sat Jul 9 , 2011 8:00 am BST LOS ANGELES -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Betty Ford , the wife of the late President Gerald Ford , who overcame alcohol and prescription drug addictions and helped found a rehabilitation clinic that bears her name , died on Friday at the age of 93 . `` I was deeply saddened this afternoon when I heard of Betty Ford 's death , '' another former first lady , Nancy Reagan , said in a statement confirming Ford 's death . Ford once was dubbed the `` fighting first lady '' by Time magazine because of her outspoken political views , which often differed from those of her husband 's Republican Party . She strongly supported women 's rights while her husband was president from 1974 to 1977 , working the phones in a vain attempt to get states to pass the Equal Rights Amendment , which sought to give women and men equality under law . Ford 's candor was surprising for the time . She took a tolerant stance on abortion and admitted without shame that some of her children had tried marijuana . Nor was she alarmed by the prospect of her daughter having premarital sex . Ford also was an early campaigner against breast cancer . She underwent a mastectomy in 1974 , less than two months after her husband succeeded the disgraced Richard Nixon as president . Her frank discussions about her disease helped raise awareness about breast cancer and she eventually took the same approach towards her alcoholism , which she battled even as first lady . Ford 's problems with chemical dependency may have begun in 1964 , when doctors prescribed her painkillers for a pinched nerve . She developed an addiction to prescription drugs and also became dependent on alcohol during the 1960s . The Betty Ford Centre in California came into being in 1982 after Ford was treated for her addictions at the U.S. Naval Hospital at Long Beach , and saw the need for treatment that emphasized the special needs of women . `` She has been an inspiration to so many through her efforts to educate women about breast cancer and her wonderful work at the Betty Ford Centre , '' Nancy Reagan , the wife of the late President Ronald Reagan , said in the statement . `` She was Jerry Ford 's strength through some very difficult days in our country 's history and I admired her courage in facing and sharing her personal struggles with all of us . '' PRAISE FROM OBAMA , GEORGE W. BUSH President Barack Obama praised Ford 's courage and compassion . `` As our nation 's first lady , she was a powerful advocate for women 's health and women 's rights , '' he said in a statement . `` After leaving the White House , Mrs. Ford helped reduce the social stigma surrounding addiction and inspired thousands to seek much-needed treatment . '' Former President George W. Bush described her as a valued friend who `` made countless contributions to our country . '' Ford remained an active chairman of the center 's board of directors for decades and also worked to help handicapped children , the arts and the fights against AIDS and arthritis . For most of her adult life , Ford was best known as the wife of Rep. Gerald Ford , a Michigan Republican , and the mother of four children . The couple had planned to retire from Congress in 1973 when Nixon , already under fire in the Watergate scandal , chose Ford to serve as vice president after the resignation of Spiro Agnew . Ford became president after Nixon resigned on August 9 , 1974 , but he was defeated when he ran for the presidency in 1976 by Democrat Jimmy Carter . Betty delivered her husband 's concession speech because he had lost his voice on the campaign trail . Born April 8 , 1918 , in Chicago , Elizabeth Bloomer was raised in Grand Rapids , Michigan . She wanted to be a dancer and studied under Martha Graham and modelled in New York before returning to Grand Rapids and marrying a furniture salesman . They divorced after five years and she married Ford in 1948 . In her later years , Betty Ford slipped from the public eye but returned when her husband of 58 years died in 2006 . Her stately demeanor in time of grief brought her to the attention of a whole new generation that possibly knew her name only from the famous clinic . -LRB- Reporting by Bob Tourtellotte and Deborah Zabarenko ; Editing by Christopher Wilson and Bill Trott -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "266", "dct": "2011-07-11", "dates": ["2011-07-11", "2011-07-11", "1986-01-01", "1989-06-04", "1994-01-03", "1994-03-23", "1996-08-29", "1997-12-06", "1948-01-01", "2000-10-25", "2001-05-23", "2011-07-03", "2006-01-13", "2011-07-09", "2010-08-22", "2011-06-20", "2011-07-10", "1955-01-01"], "text": "Mon Jul 11 , 2011 12:33 pm BST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Divers searching a Russian river boat which sank in the Volga at the weekend said they saw more than a hundred bodies trapped inside .

The pound suffered as the euro fell roughly 1 percent versus the dollar , but losses in the single currency were supportive for sterling , as it kept the euro below 90 pence following a poke above that psychologically crucial level earlier this month . Market participants said sterling would continue to be jerked around by the euro and developments in the euro zone as finance ministers hold an emergency meeting on Monday . Analysts say euro-negative comments or developments would drag the pound lower versus the dollar . `` On one side , sterling should be weak as well -LRB- along with the euro -RRB- because if the euro zone is weak the UK could be affected given its proximity , '' said Ankita Dudani , currency strategist at RBS . `` But the other argument is that if people are pulling money out of European countries , they could look at the UK as an alternative . '' Dudani added that she agreed with the former argument and saw more scope for the pound to fall against the dollar . RBS sees fair value for the pair at $ 1.55 , she said . Given the spotlight on euro zone debt problems , market participants said the pound showed limited reaction to data showing the economy grew only modestly in the second quarter . Signs that the economy is struggling to recover have been dogging the pound , as such fragility is expected to keep the Bank of England from raising interest rates anytime soon . The central bank has acknowledged the possibility that it may even consider more quantitative easing if the economy is unable to snap out of its rout . Low interest rates and QE are negative for sterling as they add to its rate disadvantage versus other currencies were rates are rising . Sterling fell around 0.6 percent on the day to a session low of $ 1.5946 . It retreated from a session high of $ 1.6042 after early gains fizzled ahead of resistance at $ 1.6048 , the 200-day moving average . The pound offered little reaction to data from the Chambers of Commerce indicated that the economy expanded by 0.3 percent in April-June , and that a slowdown in export demand suggests the recovery is shaky . Broad demand for safe-haven dollars , the world 's most liquid currency , kept the pound in range of $ 1.5912 , and a fall below this level would take sterling to its weakest in more than five months . Traders said a test of the $ 1.5900 level was possible in the near term , particularly if the euro continues to suffer . `` The risk is for a break lower , '' said a trader in London . `` It probably needs a lower EUR\\/USD to spark the move but with EZ debt , lack of UK growth and no chance of UK rate rise soon I guess eventual downside break is likely . '' The euro slipped 0.3 percent to 88.40 pence , its weakest since late June . The single currency has been unable to maintain gains above 90 pence hit earlier this month . Dudani at RBS said that level would provide strong resistance , and that any rise above that level would offer an opportunity to sell , given ongoing debt risks in the euro zone . Disdain for sterling was reflected in the latest IMM data on speculator positioning , which showed a jump in the net short positions in the pound -- bets to sell the currency -- to 31,669 contracts last week , the highest in roughly a year . While hefty positioning in favor of the pound 's downside adds to the view that investors are keen to sell the currency , it can also be seen as a warning sign of an impending shift in positioning , which may result in a correction . -LRB- Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu ; Editing by Toby Chopra -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "28", "dct": "2011-07-13", "dates": ["2011-07-13", "2011-07-13", "2011-01-01", "2011-03-01", "2011-06-01", "2011-03-01", "2011-04-01", "2011-06-01", "2011-06-01", "2011-07-08", "2011-01-01", "2011-05-01", "2005-01-01"], "text": "DUBAI | Wed Jul 13 , 2011 7:13 am BST DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Saudi Arabia has helped damp down democracy movements sweeping the Arab world but is waiting now to see how events play out in places like Syria and Yemen for fear of overplaying its hand . After witnessing the sudden collapse of rulers in Egypt and Tunisia this year , the Al Saud family that monopolises power in Saudi Arabia orchestrated Gulf Arab moves to stop the unrest from spreading through the Gulf region . Saudi , United Arab Emirates and Kuwaiti forces went to Bahrain in March to help crush protests threatening to force the ruling family there to make democratic changes . They offered money to Oman and Bahrain for more social spending , and Qatar 's Al Jazeera TV toned down its hard-hitting Gulf coverage after meetings between Saudi and Qatari officials . Riyadh was the prime mover behind a Gulf Cooperation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- proposal to enhance relations with Jordan and Morocco in an apparent effort to boost other Arab dynastic systems . A Saudi official said Jordan was given $ 400 million -LRB- 251 million pounds -RRB- last month . In March and April it also brokered a peace deal in Yemen , a republic different in size and social make-up to the GCC countries , that was to see President Ali Abdullah Saleh step down one month after forming a cabinet . Yet following that flurry of interventions , Saudi diplomacy has largely gone quiet , most notably on two fronts where Riyadh has major interests -- Yemen and Syria . Its response also has been muted in Libya , a more distant concern for Riyadh . Analysts and diplomats say there are disputes within the ranks of senior princes and officials on whether to take a back seat , intervene more forcefully to stop democratic changes or , in some cases , to back them . Turki Al-Rasheed , a Saudi commentator who runs the Saudi In Focus web forum , said the kingdom 's leaders had run out of ideas on how to challenge the movements amid internal disputes and given the lethargy of senior princes holding different briefs . `` They are quiet because they did something and it failed . Bahrain is still boiling . The only card now is to pay the Americans billions for their weapons , '' he said , referring to reports that $ 60 billion in arms purchases from the United States would rise to $ 90 billion . The ruling Al Khalifa family has instituted a national dialogue in Bahrain , but protests continue in neighborhoods of the majority Shi'ite population , who dominated the protest movement . Demonstrations rekindled in Oman last week . Saudi Arabia has seen only a small number of protests in Shi'ite areas of its Eastern Province . Stern government warnings and promises of massive social spending have helped hold back a protest movement taking off on its soil . `` There is no one single Saudi policy . Each issue is handled from a different point of view and they -LRB- the princes -RRB- are all very old and sick , '' Rasheed said . Diplomats in Riyadh often say rigor mortis usually sets in with Saudi policy initiatives during the long summer recess . One Saudi commentator who did not wish to be named said there has been division over how to proceed on Yemen . Interior Minister Prince Nayef backs Saleh while Crown Prince and Defense Minister Prince Sultan favor alternatives among tribes paid by the kingdom . However , Sultan , in his 80s , left last month for treatment in New York and Nayef , in his late 70s , also has been abroad for rest and recreation . Saleh has been convalescing in a Riyadh hospital since early June when he was badly burnt in an apparent assassination attempt . A bomb went off as he and government officials were performing Friday prayers in a mosque at his palace . But Riyadh has made no clear effort to enforce the GCC peace initiative , which Arab and Western diplomats say was largely a Saudi proposal from the beginning . Ghanem Nuseibah , London-based analyst at Political Capital , said the Saudi family 's first preference for Saleh to remain in power had given way to promoting Hamid Al-Ahmar , a 44-year-old businessman close to U.S. officials . The Saudi ideal is for Saleh 's system of family rule , balancing Saudi-backed tribal forces , to remain intact . This is exactly what the democracy activists who first took to the streets of Sanaa in January want to avoid . But fighting between tribesmen of Sadeq Al-Ahmar , head of the Hashed tribal confederation , and government forces loyal to Saleh -- whose military and security apparatus are headed by his extended family -- broke out in May . This confounded Saudi efforts at that stage to engineer cosmetic change . Now Riyadh is holding on to Saleh while it weighs its options on who can be the most effective strongman among the tribes it funded during Saleh 's 33 years of rule , Nuseibah said . Nuseibah said even Yemeni tribal figures close to Riyadh have expressed frustration with Saudi inaction . `` They see the way the Saudis have reacted since the beginning , '' he said . `` First they were pro-Saleh , then they bring Saleh to Riyadh but still letting him be a figurehead for the current regime , though he is not personally ruling . '' Saudi relations with Syria have been strained since the murder in 2005 of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri , a Saudi citizen and facilitator of Saudi policy in Lebanon where Iran has influence through Shi'ite group Hezbollah . Riyadh accuses Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad of helping Iran in a policy of extending its influence in Arab countries , primarily through its alliance with Lebanon 's Hezbollah . But while Al Jazeera and Saudi mouthpiece Al Arabiya TV have focussed heavily on Damascus 's attempt to crush protests , there have been no diplomatic initiatives to resolve the conflict , as France , Turkey and the United States have dominated international reaction to the turmoil in Syria . Some Saudis say this is not because the ruling clique -- King Abdullah , Nayef , Sultan and a few other senior princes -- do no want to see Assad removed from power . `` With Libya and Syria , I 'm sure the government would like to see those leaders fall , but in their own time , without getting involved , '' the Saudi commentator who requested anonymity said . `` Naturally Saudi Arabia , being a kingdom , sees any sudden change in power that 's now happening in the Middle East as a threat that might be contagious at some point , '' he added .

Reuters correspondents were expelled from Syrian shortly after unrest began in March . Social media played a pivotal role in the ousting of Arab leaders in Egypt and Tunisia , but activists in an uprising in Syria fear Syria the government is keeping tabs on them by scanning websites such as Facebook and Twitter . `` I am too scared to speak about my political activity on Facebook , '' said a 21-year-old activist , who asked to be referred to as Rana . `` I 'm not going to open a Twitter account , '' she said , referring to the micro-blogging website where users post 140-character `` Tweets . '' Rana 's fears stem from the widespread belief that government hackers are browsing the Internet to search for dissidents and tracking them down via social media websites . Another activist , who asked to be referred to as Ammar , said he used to post anti-government comments on his Facebook page but stopped after his uncle , who is a member of the ruling Baath Party and works closely with local security , warned him that his name had come up as a dissident . `` My uncle told me that I 'm now on a list of people who the -LRB- Syrian -RRB- security are keeping an eye on . -LRB- My uncle said -RRB- it must be because security were scanning my Facebook activity , '' he said at a cafe in the Old City of Damascus . In May , U.S. officials told the Washington Post that Iran had started providing the Syrian government with sophisticated surveillance equipment to assist in tracking down opponents via the Internet . Officials said the same techniques were used in Iran to crush a pro-democracy `` Green Movement '' in 2009 . Both Iran and Syria deny that Tehran is sending equipment to help the Syrian government spy on its own citizens . Since taking power in 2000 , President Bashar al-Assad 's government has sought to stifle dissent by banning websites like Facebook , where users can interact with other members outside Syria . Many Internet cafes in Damascus started using web proxies to bypass the block and gain access to Facebook , but earlier this year Syrians suddenly found they could get onto the site . Activists say it was a ploy . `` The government reopened Facebook because they realized that it was more useful for them to allow activists to communicate on the site , and then track us down using their team of loyalists who search the Internet , '' Rana said . But pro-Assad Syrians have come out in the thousands to voice their support for the president online , another possible reason for unblocking social media websites . An online battle has ensued in which pro- and anti-government users have created Facebook groups to support or condemn the government . `` It is important to show my love for my president on Facebook , because many people outside Syria think that there is a revolution in Syria against Assad , but that 's not true , '' Muhammad Merei , a student from the coastal town of Lattakia , told Reuters in a Facebook message . `` They wanted to -LRB- create -RRB- a civil war , they attacked the army and killed many people , '' he added . Merei , who has a picture of Assad on his Facebook page , is a member of dozens of pro-Assad Facebook groups , including one dedicated to closing the prominent dissident group , `` Syrian Revolution 2011 . '' One Facebook group , titled `` Bashar Al-Asad , '' has more than 192,000 followers . During the Egyptian revolution , which started in January , activists would use social media to organize demonstrations . In Syria , a country of 20 million , activists say that would be too risky . `` There are Facebook groups that organize protests , but they only give the location of the protest at the very last minute , '' Rana told Reuters at her apartment in Damascus . `` You do n't know what time it will start until just before it actually starts . '' Rana , and other Internet-savvy activists , worry that hackers will discover the time and location of the demonstration and send police to arrest anyone who shows up . Landlines and mobile phones are tapped and Syrians who want to buy a SIM card have to provide identification and a thumbprint . Instead , activists try to organize demonstrations by word of mouth or on instant messaging Internet programs , which they say are harder to track . Diplomats in Damascus say the fear of using the Internet has been one reason why anti-government protests have not achieved the same turnout as demonstrations in Cairo of Sanaa , Yemen 's capital , where more than 100,000 people have rallied for the overthrow of President Ali Abdullah Saleh . `` Fear is a big factor , '' a senior European diplomat told Reuters at his home in Damascus . `` But there are also still a lot of Assad loyalists in the capital and the government has a strong security presence here . '' Syria 's protests started in poverty-stricken rural provinces , where Internet usage is low . Still , activists know the Internet is essential to get information out of the country and , often , social media websites are the only option . Most foreign journalists are barred from working in Syria and local media outlets self-censor . The press coverage has come mostly from exiled human rights activists , anonymous Syrian bloggers and videos of demonstrations uploaded to YouTube . `` I have a blog , but I 'll never use my real name , '' said Ammar , the Syrian activist who regularly attends protests in the Damascus suburbs . `` We need more people in Syria to talk about the atrocities that are happening here . '' In his spare time , Ammar makes short films on his laptop using footage he finds on YouTube of police firing on protesters . He hopes the videos will help to keep interest in Syria high as the unrest draws out into the summer months . But pro-Assad Syrians have sought to discredit many of the videos on YouTube , saying they are faked or the footage is not genuine . Indeed , some of the videos posted by anti-Assad protesters were later discovered to have come from neighboring Iraq or Lebanon , during civil unrest . Activists know footage of peaceful demonstrations will serve to diminish the government 's credibility and have started filming protests live over the Internet to prevent government loyalists from challenging the video 's authenticity . In the past few weeks , satellite TV networks have aired live footage of demonstrations in the city of Hama , the scene of some of the biggest anti-Assad demonstrations and of a brutal crackdown by his father nearly 30 years ago . Assad deployed tanks outside the city last week . But the Syrian government , Ammar said , is trying very hard to outwit bloggers and human rights activists . `` On days when a lot of people are killed , the government will just shut down the Internet . Then nobody knows .

Civilian deaths hit a record high , up 15 percent compared to the first half of 2010 , due to roadside and suicide bombings , increased ground fighting and more deaths from air strikes . The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan -LRB- UNAMA -RRB- said 1,462 civilians had been killed in conflict-related incidents . It blamed insurgents for 80 percent of those deaths -- up nearly a third on the same period last year . `` The rising tide of violence and bloodshed in the first half of 2011 brought injury and death to Afghan civilians at levels without recorded precedent in the current armed conflict , '' the report said , adding that plans to hand over security in parts of the country helped fuel the rise in casualties . `` Violence rose as -LRB- insurgents -RRB- sought to demonstrate that Afghan security forces could not manage security on their own . '' Staffan de Mistura , special representative in Afghanistan for the U.N. Secretary-General , told a news conference the U.N. mission had been in contact with the Taliban to ask them to reduce the number of civilian deaths . He declined to comment on their response to the U.N. 's request . Pro-government forces , including the Afghan police and army and NATO-led troops were responsible for 14 percent of civilian deaths , a drop of 9 percent . But air strikes , one of the most controversial tactics in the war , killed more people . The mid-year report found that air strikes carried out by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- were the leading cause of civilian deaths by pro-government forces , so far killing 79 civilians in 2011 , up 14 percent . Apache attack helicopters played a much more prominent role , mainly in the east and southeast of the country , said Georgette Gagnon , director of human rights at the U.N. mission . A third of civilian deaths attributed to air strikes in 2010 were caused by those aircraft , while in the first half of 2011 they were responsible for 56 percent of air strike deaths . De Mistura said that while ISAF had been successful in reducing the number of civilian deaths it caused , `` for an international force that is meant to protect civilians , one civilian killed , even by mistake , is one too many . '' The United Nations also warned the full picture could be even worse , as the report did not include data from the northern region of Afghanistan between March and June , because the U.N. office was shut after it was overrun by a mob that killed seven U.N. staff . `` It may be that UNAMA is under-reporting civilian casualties given limitations associated with the operating environment , '' the report said . ISAF and the Taliban were not immediately able to comment on the U.N. report . Pierre Kraehenbuehl , the global director of operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- , said he was `` gravely concerned '' about critical levels of insecurity that risked displacing many more Afghans . `` Many people have told us that they face now an almost impossible dilemma which is either choose a side or leave home , '' he told a separate news conference in the Afghan capital . The U.N. World Food Program also said Wednesday that two to three million people across Afghanistan are likely to need extra food aid from September following drought and a poor wheat harvest this year . While the number of insurgent suicide attacks in Afghanistan was largely unchanged , the number of civilians they killed soared by half , the largest increase in deaths from any tactic . Insurgents who have been squeezed in some of their traditional heartlands have tried spectacular urban attacks to underline their reach as NATO troops race to prepare Afghan forces for a security handover which begins this year . `` Suicide attacks in 2011 have become more complex , often using multiple bombers in spectacular attacks that kill many Afghan civilians , '' found the report . Eight Afghan civilians and one foreigner were killed last month in an assault on Kabul 's Intercontinental hotel , just days after a suicide car bomber killed at least 20 people at a hospital in remote east Afghanistan . There were 190 targeted killings , compared to 181 in the same period of 2010 . Ground combat caused more than 304 deaths , up more than a third , with 188 of those deaths attributed to insurgents , 66 to pro-government forces and 50 to crossfire . Controversial night raids by the U.S. military , which Afghan President Hamid Karzai has criticised as inciting people to join the Taliban-led insurgency , fell slightly in the first half of 2011 , accounting for 2 percent of all civilian deaths . `` However , resentment regarding these raids grew among the Afghan population . Violent demonstrations sometimes followed night raids and led to deaths and injuries of civilians . '' The U.N. mission in Afghanistan also said it was concerned by the increasing use of children in the decade-long war , particularly after recording the youngest suicide bomber -- a 12-year-old who killed three civilians and injured 12 on May 1 .

BEIRUT | Mon Jul 18 , 2011 2:07 pm BST BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - At least 30 people were killed at the weekend in clashes between residents in Homs , a rights group said , in the first factional fighting since protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad erupted in March . Rami Abdelrahman , head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , said on Monday that clashes between pro- and anti-Assad residents started on Saturday after the bodies of kidnapped Assad supporters were returned to their relatives dismembered . Homs has been a focal point of the uprising since the military stormed it two months ago to try to crush street protests calling for Assad to quit after 11 years in power . The central city is a microcosm of Syria 's religious schism with a Sunni Muslim majority living alongside minority groups , including Christians and Alawite Muslims , Assad 's own sect . `` At least 30 civilians were killed ... they fell after civil fighting between pro- and anti-regime -LRB- residents -RRB- started on Saturday , '' the Observatory said in statement . `` These clashes are a dangerous development that undermines the revolution and serves the interests of its enemies who want to turn it into a civil war , '' he said . Mohamad Saleh , an activist and a resident of Homs , said the there was no more fighting on Monday but residents were tense . He said a group of Alawite men , including four policemen , went missing on Thursday . The bodies of four of them were found on Saturday with their eyes gouged out . Six more were found on Sunday . `` Immediately some people from their neighborhood -LRB- in the Alawite area -RRB- went to the street and torched , robbed and destroyed at least 12 shops belonging to Sunnis , '' he told Reuters by telephone . `` The security forces were watching and did not do anything . Then shooting started and we did not know where it was coming from and people started dying from both sides . '' Saleh said that residents of Homs blame Sunni and Alawite `` thugs '' for the violence . `` This is very dangerous , we are trying to calm things down . Nobody in Homs accepts this , the people do not want these -LRB- sectarian -RRB- divisions , '' he said . The anti-Assad protests started in Syria 's poorer Sunni rural areas , but quickly spread to cities which have more of a sectarian mix .

Among those killed were 10 mourners at a funeral for another 10 people who were killed by security forces on Monday , the Local Coordinations Committee , an activists group , said . Syrian authorities have expelled most foreign journalists , making it hard to verify activist accounts or official statements . `` We could not bury the martyrs at the city 's main cemetery so we opted for a smaller cemetery near the mosque , when the militiamen began firing at us from their cars , '' one mourner , who gave his name as Abdallah , told Reuters by telephone . He said the bodies had been taken to Khaled Ibn al-Walid mosque in the eastern Khalidiya district of the city . `` Khalidiya is totally besieged by the military . We are cut off from the rest of Homs as if we are a separate country . '' Homs has been a major center of protests against Assad 's rule and tension has run high between the majority Sunni inhabitants and members of the Alawite minority , the same sect as Assad . Khalidiya is inhabited by members of Sunni tribes from rural Homs while the nearby Nozha neighborhood is home to most of the country 's security forces and militiamen , from the Alawite sect . The 16 deaths reported in Homs ' Khalidiya and Bab Amr neighborhoods on Tuesday brought the total death count since the weekend to at least 33 , activists and residents said . Another resident said : `` There are troops and armored vehicles in every neighborhood . The irregular forces with them are death squads . They have been firing indiscriminately since dawn with rifles and machineguns . No one can leave their homes . '' Troops and tanks first entered Homs , 165 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- north of Damascus , two months ago and occupied the main square after large protests demanding political freedoms . Homs , the hometown of Assad 's Sunni wife Asma , has seen an influx of Alawites in the last 20 years as the community tightened its grip on security and public jobs . The Syrian National Human Rights Organization said seven people were killed over the weekend in attacks by security forces . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bodies of 30 people were found in Homs over the weekend , and that some were mutilated . `` After failing to ignite a sectarian civil war , the regime is expanding military operations to subdue the mass protests in Homs , '' Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told Reuters . Human rights organizations say troops , security forces and militiamen killed at least 1,400 civilians in Syria , adding that more than 12,000 Syrians and security personnel who refused to fire at civilians had been shot dead . Syrian authorities blame `` armed terrorist groups '' with Islamist links for the violence and say at least 500 policemen and soldiers have been killed since March . Assad had described the uprising as a foreign conspiracy to sow sectarian strife . His opponents argue that the president has been playing on sectarian fears to maintain Alawite support and keep power for his family , which has ruled Syria for 41 years . Once courted by the West as a possible moderate in the region , Assad is becoming increasingly isolated internationally , with Iran 's Shi'ite clerical rulers maintaining their support , to the disquiet of Syria 's majority Sunnis . Diplomatic pressure mounted on Assad on Monday after Qatar , previously a major supporter , shut its embassy in Damascus and the European Union said it was considering tougher sanctions . Qatar was a major backer of Syria until protests broke out in March , but relations deteriorated when Sunni Muslims began to be killed by Assad 's security forces , whose leaders , like the president , belong to the minority Alawite sect . In the tribal province of Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria , residents of Albu Kamal , on the border with Iraq , said security had eased its grip after holding talks with the troops . Notables from the region want to avoid an assault after defections among security forces who had tried to quell street demonstrations . Thousands of people took to the streets of Albu Kamal in a night demonstration on Wednesday demanding Assad 's removal , activists said . They added that large protests also continued across Deir al-Zor , in the Qaboun district of Damascus and in other towns and cities across the country .

Elaraby met Assad as part of a regional tour last week and was quoted by media as saying the League did not accept `` outside interference in the internal affairs of the Arab countries , '' even as diplomatic pressure mounts on Damascus . The League has kept a low profile in discussing the Syrian protests and Elaraby 's predecessor only voiced `` worry , '' signalling division in the 22-member body over how to proceed . `` I met with President Bashar al-Assad ... I spoke to him about the necessity of reform and I received a promise from him that he will work on that , '' Elaraby , named as the League 's new Secretary General in May , said at its Cairo-based headquarters . `` This is all I will say and I can not clarify more on that . '' Diplomatic pressure mounted on Assad on Monday after Qatar , previously a supporter , shut its embassy in Damascus and the European Union said it was considering tougher sanctions . Assad has described the uprising as a foreign conspiracy to sow sectarian strife . His troops and security forces have killed over 1,400 civilians and arrested more than 12,000 , according to rights groups . Analysts say the Arab League 's reticence may be a reflection of fears of what the Middle East may look like without Bashar , whose family has ruled Syria for 41 years . `` I found that , given the changing conditions in the region , I should start with a tour to know the leaders and their visions for what the Arab League could do in current conditions , '' said Elaraby , previously Egypt 's foreign minister . `` I have been careful to emphasise the importance of listening and fulfilling the demands of the Arab peoples , '' he added , but declined to say what he was seeking to do in Syria . That reserve contrasts with the role the League played in paving the way for NATO military strikes on Libya when it asked the U.N. Security Council to impose a no-fly zone to protect civilians in a rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi . `` On Syria ... it has to be clear that the Arab League ... is a diplomatic institution , '' he said . `` Not all that is being said inside closed rooms could be discussed with the media . '' The Arab League plans to ask the United Nations to upgrade the Palestinians to full member status .

Credit : Reuters\\/Parbul TV via Reuters Tv NEW YORK | Wed Jul 20 , 2011 12:19 am BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As Rupert Murdoch sat through the first hour of questioning by British lawmakers probing News Corp 's phone-hacking scandal , it looked like days of work by his team of crisis management advisers would go up in smoke . They crafted an opening statement for the media mogul that included a killer sound bite -- `` This is the most humble day of my life '' -- only to have the parliamentary committee deny him the chance to deliver it . That appeared to shake the 80-year-old Murdoch , who sounded exasperated and looked uncomfortable in the early going on Tuesday , dodging questions and banging his hands on the table he shared with his son James . `` That first hour was a real bummer , '' said one source close to News Corp. `` He looked overprepared by the lawyers . In time , he stepped up into being himself . He pushed back a bit , talked about his ethics . '' Murdoch 's performance , far from perfect , still probably came as a relief to his public relations advisers , who were charged with finding a strategy to contain a telephone-hacking scandal that has turned into full-blown crisis for News Corp. . The team , which assembled in London late last week , included outside advisers Alex Bigg and James Lundie from Edelman , the world 's biggest PR firm , and Steven Rubenstein from Rubenstein Public Relations , a fixture in New York communications with a long history with the Murdochs . The in-house team was led by Joel Klein , who once headed the U.S. Justice Department 's antitrust unit -LRB- ID : nN1E76E1OR -RRB- , and Matthew Anderson , who runs News Corp 's strategic affairs . From that group of advisers came the suggestion late last week that Murdoch sit down with and apologise to the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler , whose phone was hacked by his now-shuttered Sunday tabloid , News of the World . Murdoch also prepared a broader apology to readers that ran in all national British newspapers over the weekend , and then moved to quiet critics by accepting the resignation of trusted employees News International Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks and Dow Jones & Co CEO Les Hinton . Even within the circle of close advisers , however , few believe Murdoch has found the silver bullet to end the crisis . `` This is burning white hot , '' said the source . `` You 've got to let it burn for a while . '' In a sign that News Corp is concerned the crisis could spread to the United States , it hired Sard Verbinnen , based in New York , and The Glover Park Group , based in Washington D.C. , to assist in public and government relations . Rubenstein will also play a key role in the United States . The son of legendary communications veteran Howard Rubenstein has represented Murdoch 's New York Post as well as entertainment figures such as David Letterman , who hired him to deal with a scandal over a series of affairs with work colleagues . `` Recovery from a crisis of this magnitude is slow , '' said Chris Tennyson , co-leader of crisis communications practice at Fleishman-Hillard , which is not involved in the matter . `` Anyone who had bone to pick with Rupert Murdoch is now in the water . It will open a period of intensity -- it will be fierce and furious . '' Still , experts say Murdoch appears on better footing after misjudging the depth of public anger over allegations that News of the World journalists hacked into the voicemails of thousands of people , from crime victims to families of soldiers killed in combat . Among the team of PR aces , a lot of credit is being given to Klein , a former New York City schools chancellor who has been tapped to lead a new management and standards committee at News Corp. . Anderson , too , is getting high marks . A former junior tennis champion , he has been close friends with James Murdoch since they both worked in Asia -- Anderson for the PR firm Ogilvy and Murdoch for BSkyB . Murdoch later hired Anderson , a native of San Francisco , to run communications for BSkyB before bringing him onboard News Corp. . James Murdoch is viewed as having carried himself well during the proceeding , outperforming his father and relieving some of the pressure over his future . The senior Murdoch gained momentum in the second hour of the hearing -- he did manage to slip in the `` humble '' quote early on -- offering more forceful answers on his responsibility and the role of his papers in British society . An unexpected attack by a protester wielding a plate of white foam , who was fought off by Murdoch 's wife , Wendi , only served to help his case , PR experts said . It became the leading headline and humanized the billionaire media baron . `` The combination of Rupert Murdoch 's age and the custard pie attack will have elicited a tremendous amount of sympathy , '' said Andrew Hawkins , chairman of Comres , a polling company . `` You could n't make this stuff up . It could have turned the whole situation around for them .

ADEN\\/SANAA | Wed Jul 20 , 2011 7:17 pm BST ADEN\\/SANAA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A blast in a booby-trapped car killed a Briton living in Yemen 's southern port city of Aden on Wednesday , officials said , and the British government urged its citizens to leave the country . Opposition officials said one of their political leaders survived an assassination attempt in the capital Sanaa and warned of further unrest . A security source told Reuters he believed militants were behind the blast that killed the long-time British resident of Aden , who was in his 60s , as he started his car . The victim was an independent surveyor working for marine and insurance companies in Yemen . A Western shipping source based in Aden said the Briton had just returned from surveying a tanker attacked in July by pirates off Yemen 's coast . `` We tend to think that it was some kind of terrorist attack because he was well known , '' the security source said . Attacks on foreigners are rare in the port city , which lies east of a strategic shipping lane through which some 3 million barrels of oil pass daily . The impoverished Arabian Peninsula state , neighbor to Saudi Arabia , is grappling with growing turmoil as mass protests calling for an end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's rule drag into a sixth month . Washington and Riyadh fear the unrest gives al Qaeda 's Yemen-based wing more room to operate . Witnesses in Aden said the British victim 's car blew up as soon as he turned on the engine , shattering windows in nearby buildings on Aden 's Mualla Plaza . `` He started the car and it immediately exploded and he was engulfed in flames , '' a witness said by telephone . One passer-by was critically wounded in the blast which also damaged nearby buildings , a municipal official said . She said there was no indication who was behind the explosion . `` It 's clear that there was some kind of explosive device placed in his car , '' she said . A British Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed the Briton 's death and said the government was advising all British nationals against traveling to the whole of Yemen , a position which `` could n't be any firmer . '' Aden had been relatively quiet in recent months , even as protests in other parts of the country erupted into sporadic violence . The neighbouring Abyan province has witnessed daily bloodshed since Islamist militants seized the city of Jaar in March and the provincial capital of Zinjibar in May . The army , which says the militants are part of al Qaeda 's Yemen-based wing , launched an offensive to retake Zinjibar five days ago but has yet to regain the city . The army impose a security belt around Aden several weeks ago to try to prevent more militants from slipping into the strategic port city . It had previously reported that several al Qaeda linked operatives had snuck into Aden , where some 54,000 Abyan residents have sought refuge . Further north in the capital Sanaa , opposition officials said the head of the leading Islamist party Islah survived an attack by gunmen . Sanaa has been the scene of rising violence in recent days following weeks of relative calm after Saleh traveled to Saudi Arabia for treatment on wounds he suffered in a bomb blast at his compound . Yemen 's opposition coalition said the gunmen fired on Islah leader Mohammed al-Yadumi 's car but he escaped the attack . The group blamed Saleh 's family and forces loyal to him , and warned the move could spark worse violence in the fragmented nation . `` Targeting the head of Islah is an attempt to plunge the country into civil war . Saleh 's family is deluded in thinking it can remain in power , '' the coalition said in a statement . -LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf in Aden , Mohammed Ghobari in Sanaa , Humeyra Pamuk in Dubai and Stephen Mangan in London ; Writing by Erika Solomon ; Editing by Alistair Lyon -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "283", "dct": "2011-07-21", "dates": ["2011-06-01", "2012-05-01", "2012-05-01", "2011-07-21", "2011-06-01", "2012-03-01", "2011-06-01", "2010-06-01", "2011-07-01", "2012-03-11", "2011-07-21", "2011-06-01", "2011-05-01", "2011-06-01", "2010-06-01", "2011-05-01", "2011-06-01", "2011-05-01", "2008-09-01", "2011-06-01", "2010-06-01"], "text": "\\* Japan 's LNG imports hit record for month of June \\* Pace of yr\\/yr LNG import growth eases to 10.6 pct from May 's 26.0 pct \\* Crude imports up 1.9 pct yr\\/yr , vs May 's 6.9 pct rise \\* Utilities import more fossil fuels as nuclear reactors stay offline -LRB- Rewrites lead , adds detail -RRB- TOKYO , July 21 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Japan 's imports of liquefied natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- rose to a record high for the month of June as utilities used more fossil fuels to make up for the loss of nuclear reactors shut by the March earthquake and tsunami or kept offline due to safety concerns . Imports by the world 's biggest LNG importer rose 10.6 percent year-on-year in June , marking a third consecutive month of increases . Similarly , Japan 's imports of crude oil rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier , the second monthly gain in a row . LNG and crude oil imports are expected to continue rising , mainly to meet higher demand from utilities preparing for peak power use in the summer . Despite expanded energy conservation requests by the Japanese government this week , the chances looks slim for an imminent restart of any nuclear reactors which are ready to come back online after regular maintenance , given newly imposed safety measures . Earlier this month , Japan announced plans to order `` stress tests '' for the nation 's nuclear reactors , hoping to bolster public confidence shaken by the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex in the northeast after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami caused meltdowns and radiation leaks . Thursday 's data showed Japan 's imports of LNG totalled 6.228 million tonnes last month . The pace of year-on-year growth slowed to 10.6 percent from 26.0 percent in May . Japan , the world 's third-biggest oil consumer , also imported 1.9 percent more crude in June than a year earlier , at 15.39 million kiloliters -LRB- 3.23 million barrels per day -RRB- , the Ministry of Finance 's preliminary customs-cleared data showed . In May , Japan 's crude oil imports rose 6.9 percent to 15.497 million kl -LRB- 3.14 million bpd -RRB- . The Japan Crude Cocktail -LRB- JCC -RRB- price , or the average price for customs-cleared crude oil imports which is used as the benchmark for LNG prices for Japanese buyers , fell to $ 114.68 a barrel in June . The price peaked in May at $ 118.58 , the highest since September 2008 . Imports of thermal coal for power generation rose 7.0 percent in June from a year earlier to 8.167 million tonnes .

But it may not be enough to avoid a painful debt restructuring sometime in coming years . Economists said the steps announced by euro zone leaders on Thursday , including cheaper bailout loans and a contribution by private investors , would prevent Greek debt from surging to 172 percent of gross domestic product next year as the International Monetary Fund forecast earlier this month . The debt is now at about 150 percent , having soared from 127 percent in 2009 to 143 percent last year . But the second bailout is not the game-changer that some European Union policymakers have claimed , and Greece will probably continue to struggle with high debt for many years . `` A full-scale default is avoided , for now . A full-scale default with a proper haircut -LRB- cut in the principal amount -RRB- is still , in our view , inevitable , '' UBS senior economist Paul Donovan said in a report . `` It may be next year , it may be the year after , but Greece will have to haircut its debt by around 50 percent at some point to have any hope of credibility . '' As part of the package , interest on European bailout loans to Greece will be cut to around 3.5 percent from roughly 4 percent now . Maturities on these loans will be doubled to a minimum of 15 years and extended to as much as 30 years , with a grace period of 10 years . In addition , private creditors will be offered a menu of options including bond swaps , a rollover into debt with maturities of up to 30 years , and a buyback of bonds , involving a loss of about 21 percent on the face value of the debt . The European Union estimated the private sector would contribute 50 billion euros on a net basis through mid-2014 , of which 37 billion euros -LRB- 32.6 billion pounds -RRB- would come from debt exchanges and 12.6 billion euros from the bond buyback . Together , the steps will cause a major reduction in financial pressure on Greece . Thanks to the first bailout of Athens , about 40 billion euros of its 340 billion euro debt is in the form of EU loans , and the proportion will rise ; the grace period means Athens will not have to be make payments on this part of the debt for 10 years . The IMF may offer similar relief on its loans , which are half the size of the EU 's . Also , the bond swaps and buyback will reduce the bond redemptions which Athens will have to meet between 2015 and 2020 . Combined with the primary budget surpluses which Greece is projected to start running next year , it may have minimal market funding needs for the rest of this decade . Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Thursday that the country 's funding needs would be covered up to 2020 . Reducing Greece 's funding needs is different from cutting its debt mountain to levels that the markets will consider safe and sustainable over the long term , however . Many private analysts think that at the very least , the debt\\/GDP ratio needs to be cut below 100 percent , and some suggest 80 percent ; EU rules stipulate 60 percent . It is not clear whether the projected 50 billion euro contribution which the EU expects from the private sector refers entirely to reductions in Greece 's debt . Assuming it does , the debt ratio could fall to around 130 percent in 2014 . Assuming further that Greece can meet its ambitious target of raising a full 50 billion euros from privatisations by 2015 -- a risky assumption -- and then uses all the money to reduce debt , it would reach a ratio of 105-110 percent of GDP . `` It cuts a big chunk of debt . You can not say it brings sustainability . Greece is given the best possible environment to bring its house in order , but it needs to deliver on strong reforms and privatisation , '' said Marco Valli , chief euro zone economist at Unicredit . An important factor in the equation is economic growth , which both reduces the size of the debt in relation to the economy and improves Greece 's fiscal position by generating tax revenues . So far , the numbers have been negative ; Greece 's economy shrank 4.5 percent last year , worse than the 4.0 percent contraction assumed in the first bailout plan , and the IMF now expects it to shrink 3.9 percent this year , instead of the 3.0 percent decrease envisioned by the plan . The IMF now predicts meager growth of 0.6 percent for next year . Euro zone leaders are now focussing on this issue , pledging a `` Marshall Plan '' for Greece to stimulate its economy , but so far the effort seems mainly to comprise speeding up and making more efficient the use of development aid funds allocated by the EU . Analysts doubt this is by itself enough to support strong growth . Without a currency devaluation , denied to Greece by its membership of the euro zone , the country may take years to achieve the productivity gains required to improve its economic competitiveness . `` Necessary steps have been taken , but I 'm not sure that they are sufficient , '' said ING senior euro zone economist Martin van Vliet . He said another exercise to make private creditors write off Greek debt could not be ruled out down the road . The latest bailout plan seeks to prevent Greece 's problem from destabilising the rest of Europe , `` but it 's not guaranteed that this is the beginning of the end of the crisis . '' David Mackie , head of western European economic research at JP Morgan , said one 's view of Greece 's capacity to rein in its debt essentially depended on gut assumptions . `` The two critical issues are to what extent the funding will be met and how long a time horizon you are prepared to accept . If you give it 10 years then it does n't look so bad . If you think targets will be missed , which is not an unreasonable assumption , then it clearly looks worse .

The 62-year-old Qatari , found guilty by FIFA 's ethics committee of attempting to bribe delegates in the Caribbean to vote for him in the FIFA presidential election , has been left with his reputation in tatters and a 29-year career as an administrator over . Pending any appeals he may pursue , Bin Hammam has lost his place on FIFA 's executive committee after 15 years , been stripped of the Asian Football Confederation -LRB- AFC -RRB- presidency and kissed goodbye to the lifetime privileges normally bestowed on FIFA 's elite after they have left office . His ban means he can not be involved with any club even at grassroots level , although no-one could stop him buying a ticket at the gate and watching a match as a spectator . Bin Hammam , though , is not just one of the crowd . A multi-millionaire businessman who prospered in construction , real estate and drilling as Qatar 's economy boomed in the 1980s and 1990s , he rose from the ranks of his local Al Rayyan Sports Club in Doha to the FIFA executive in 14 years . His position as the most powerful man in Asian soccer was reinforced in Doha as recently as January when he was re-elected unopposed as AFC president and , after mulling over the idea for several months , he launched his bid to depose Sepp Blatter as FIFA president and become the first Arab to rule world soccer . It seemed like the time was right . Not only did he have a fresh mandate to complete a third and final term as AFC president , but FIFA 's decision to award Qatar the right to host the 2022 World Cup finals gave him an air of confidence . Having supported Blatter closely , with logistical and strategic help when the Swiss fought Lennart Johansson for the FIFA presidency in 1998 and Issa Hayatou in 2002 , Bin Hammam knew full well the size of the task he was taking on . However , he decided that , old friendship and support aside , the time had come to reform FIFA and he was the man to do it . In some ways , for such an astute , personable and shrewd man , his plans were somewhat vague . Bin Hammam outlined proposals to expand the FIFA executive committee from 24 to possibly 40 members , declaring that he wanted the world governing body to `` be more transparent . '' He demanded more respect for clubs and member associations , promised more honesty and wanted a greater share of FIFA 's cash reserves to be distributed to the football associations . He maintained that after 13 years Blatter had been in power too long and said he would restrict the presidential term to eight years . However , as one Asian critic told Reuters at the time : `` Bin Hammam is no reformer and does not have a real program on how to change FIFA and the way the organization operates . `` There are many who think president Blatter is doing a good job -- that perceptions of FIFA can change through Blatter . I am not sure the world is ready for Bin Hammam to lead football into a new promised land . '' Anyone going into battle has supporters and opponents and clearly by mid-May , with the election just over three weeks away , Bin Hammam thought too many were still against him and he needed to make sure of more votes by paying for them with cash . Together with FIFA executive committee member Jack Warner , the president of CONCACAF and a FIFA vice-president , it was arranged that Bin Hammam would address members of the Caribbean Football Union urging them to support his attempt to unseat Blatter . He hoped that a $ 40,000 -LRB- 24,530.85 pounds -RRB- sweetener , placed in brown envelopes for them to collect on the way out , would help them make up their minds . All it did , though , was herald the suspension , then resignation of Warner after nearly 30 years on the executive committee , and provide the catalyst for Bin Hamman 's downfall . Despite his protestations of innocence , the ethics committee found Bin Hammam guilty of trying to bribe those delegates and that decision has cost him his future in the game . Bin Hammam was a familiar figure at FIFA 's showcase events , either resplendent in his Arab thobe or looking suave in his business suit . With his personal wealth and connections , he might well turn up at matches in the future , but as soccer turns its back on him , he can only look ahead to 2022 and the World Cup in his homeland and wonder what might have been .

Activists reported protests after Friday prayers in several places -- the Medan district of Damascus , Latakia on the coast , Deraa in the south and Deir al-Zor in the east -- as well as Homs , the latest focus of the armed crackdown . `` Tanks and armored vehicles have deployed in Homs thoroughfares but in every street adjacent to them there are people in the streets , '' a resident of Homs , who gave his name as Osama , said by telephone . Once confined to outlying towns and rural regions , the uprising has now taken a firm hold in cities such as Homs and Hama , scene of a 1982 massacre by the military . In the first crackdown on Kurds since the uprising began , dozens of people were wounded when police and militia used batons and teargas against protesters in the mainly Kurdish northeastern city of Qamishli , witnesses said . The protesters demanded political freedoms and an end to state-endorsed discrimination against Syria 's 1 million Kurds . They also voiced solidarity with the protesters elsewhere . Assad , 45 , has described the uprising as a foreign conspiracy intended to sow sectarian strife . Opponents say he has played on sectarian fears to maintain support of the minority Alawite sect and keep power for his family , which has ruled Syria for 41 years . Two special human rights advisers to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for an `` independent , thorough and objective investigation '' of events in Syria . `` The scale and gravity of the violations indicate a serious possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed and continue to be committed in Syria , '' Francis Deng , adviser on prevention of genocide , and Edward Luck , adviser on the responsibility to protect , said on Friday . Once courted by the West to break Syria 's alliance with Iran and militant groups , Assad is becoming increasingly isolated internationally . Iran 's Shi'ite clerical rulers are maintaining their support , to the disquiet of Syria 's majority Sunnis . Rights groups say the killings of civilians are causing a backlash against Assad among the mostly Sunni rank and file in the army . Activists say several tank crews defected this week and joined protesters in the eastern town of Albu Kamal bordering Iraq 's tribal Sunni heartland , prompting the deployment of Alawite forces who surrounded the town and demanded the army defectors be handed over . Diplomatic pressure on Assad mounted this week after Qatar , previously a supporter , shut its embassy in Damascus and the European Union said it was considering tougher sanctions . Relations with Qatar deteriorated when Sunni Muslims were among those killed by Assad 's security forces , whose leaders , like the president , are Alawites . Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Jeff Feltman told U.S. based Al Hurra TV that fear of a sectarian crisis was being instigated by Assad to sow fear among the population . `` They are trying to raise the specter of the ghost of a civil war but it 's clear from the majority of demonstrations that everyone is protesting without concern about the dangers confronting them for the sake of a better future for Syria , '' Feltman said .

The ruling followed a weekend of clashes involving protesters demanding swifter reforms and faster prosecution of Mubarak and his officials . Demonstrators clashed with stone-throwing men who blocked a march to the Defense Ministry . Many Egyptians believe the army is reluctant to speed up the trial of Mubarak , its former commander-in-chief , and say it wants to prevent his public humiliation . They also accuse the army of delaying other reforms . Judge Adel Abdel-Salam ordered the trial of Habib al-Adli be postponed until August 3 so it was `` joined with the case related to the trial of the former President Hosni Mubarak , '' adding that the evidence and charges were the same . Six others in the Adli case will be tried on the same day . Sources had earlier said Mubarak 's trial could be held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh . But merging the case with Adli and other officials could complicate moving the trial from Cairo as all defendants may have to be in the same court , legal experts said . `` The cases have been merged together : where Mubarak is tried , Adli is tried , '' Judge Ahmed Mekky , the deputy head of Egypt 's Appeal Court , said . Further delays in the case or shifting it to another place could stoke public anger as many Egyptians are particularly keen to see Adli convicted after police used live ammunition , rubber bullets and teargas to try to quash anti-Mubarak demonstrations . Some protesters at the court on the outskirts of Cairo on Monday hurled stones at the police van driving away Adli , who had stood in the cage for defendants during Monday 's session . `` Why did they postpone the trial today ? We are tired of this never-ending postponement . The son of my brother died in the revolution ; who will give us our rights ... if the court keeps postponing trials of those who killed him ? '' asked Mohamed Abdou , who was outside the court . Mubarak and his two sons , Alaa and Gamal , have been charged in connection with the killing of demonstrators . About 850 died in the 18-day uprising that ousted the president on February 11 . ` WHY TAKE ALL THIS TIME ? ' Mubarak , 83 , has been in hospital since April , in Sharm el-Sheikh . His two sons are being held in a Cairo prison . `` I am against the postponement . Why take all this time ? '' said Foad Kamal , who works in a supermarket chain . He had come to the court expecting a verdict . About 300 people were injured in Cairo Saturday when thousands of demonstrators fought opponents with stones on a march to the Defense Ministry to urge the ruling military council to speed up reforms . Activists blamed the violence on thugs who they said were encouraged by the authorities . The army has dismissed the charges and said it did not use force against demonstrators . Military police , armed with Tasers and batons , held back protesters as police fired tear gas . `` What happened Saturday was a planned attack against peaceful protesters who aim to keep up pressure on the military council to bring about faster reforms , '' said Mohamed Fahmy , a member of the Youth Coalition of the Revolution . `` We will continue to muster people on the street next Friday . We will respond in peaceful protest to Saturday 's events , '' Fahmy said . Protesters have increasingly criticised the army and arranged coordinated demonstrations in Cairo and the port cities of Alexandria and Suez . The cabinet pledged Monday to clear out officials who held senior posts in Mubarak 's era , continue with public trials and press on with other reforms , such as setting a maximum wage for higher paid officials within a month . Five police officers were referred to trial for inciting violence on February2 , when Mubarak loyalists charged protesters in Tahrir Square on camels and horses , a judicial source said . Separately , the military prosecution questioned former prime minister Ahmed Nazif over a charge of facilitating the sale of army land to a businessman , the state news agency said .

Metro group Finance Director Olaf Koch said the group still stuck to its outlook for a rise of around 10 percent in full-year profit before special items . `` Except for Media-Saturn , all sales divisions of Metro Group are within market expectations , '' he said . The comments boosted Metro 's battered shares , which have lost 30 percent this year as investors anticipated a profit warning . They were up 1.8 percent at 1204 GMT , the best performer on the German blue-chip index . `` What 's having a positive effect on the shares is that Metro confirmed earnings guidance and expects a better performance for MMS in the second half , '' BHF Bank analyst Peter Steiner said . MMS rivals Dixons Retail and Kesa Electricals have warned on trading this year and there are signs that consumers in Germany , which saw a bumper recovery at the start of the year , are holding back , too . Metro , which last year changed management at MMS after it struggled to put in place a strategy for online sales , said it was targeting online sales of 5 billion euros -LRB- $ 7.2 billion -RRB- by 2015 , with 1 billion to come from pure online player Redcoon . `` We are late coming to online . But the European market is still fragmented , and so we 're not too late , '' Koch said . MMS will also cut costs by a further 500 million euros by 2014 , including shedding about 3,000 jobs in 2011 , so it can cut prices further to attract more customers , Hagemann said . The group will start sales via the Saturn website in October , with the mediamarkt . de website to follow in January 2012 and will look to buy specialist online players , following the purchase of discount online retailer Redcoon . Specialist online retailers such as auction and coupon sites are currently growing fast , especially in the United States . Amazon.com Inc , the world 's largest online retailer , last month bought Woot , which offers a new item every day for sale until it has sold out . For the second quarter MMS posted a loss before tax , interest and special items of 44 million euros -LRB- $ 63 million -RRB- , hurt by a drop in sales in Germany and start-up losses in China . There was no mention in the statement of the group 's previously stated target for 2011 sales to grow by 4 percent , and a spokesman told Reuters the group would not be commenting on the sales target on Tuesday .

The price of stalemate is rising daily : sectarian mayhem , a growing protest movement and a faltering economy , with no sign that Bashar and his minority Alawite clan are considering an exit strategy after four decades in power . Yet so far , there is no sign of a tipping point that would assure success for protesters , as in Tunisia and Egypt , where millions took to the streets to topple autocratic leaders . `` The situation has not reached a critical mass , '' said Patrick Seale , biographer of Bashar 's father , Hafez al-Assad . `` Damascus has n't risen , the security services have n't split yet , the economy has n't collapsed . The regime looks weak and the opposition looks weaker , '' he said . Sectarian killings in the city of Homs this month may be a foretaste for a country with an ethnic and religious mix and a long history of repression by the Alawite-led security forces . The Alawite sect , an off-shoot of Shi'ite Islam , is a minority in Syria , which has a Sunni Muslim majority , as well as smaller numbers of Druze , Christians and non-Arab Kurds . A group of Alawite men , including four security men , went missing on July 14 . The bodies of four of them were found killed . Some Alawites from their neighbourood in Homs took to the streets , torched and destroyed shops belonging to Sunnis . The danger of sectarian strife is real , analysts say . It might even appeal to the authorities -- and some of their opponents -- as a way to break the deadlock . But it carries high risks for the Assad dynasty , as well as the opposition . `` This is a dangerous strategy for a regime trying to survive , '' said Eugene Rogan , director of the Middle East Centre at Oxford University . `` You watch your army disintegrate if sectarianism becomes an issue . '' Analysts say the Homs killings were provoked by a ferocious security clampdown , including the arrest , disappearance and torture to death of hundreds of men . Islamists , long persecuted by the security forces , have their own axe to grind . `` The security solution has n't worked . The regime has decided to go for civil strife because it senses that it is losing . The protests are spilling over and spreading to the capital , '' said a Damascus-based Arab journalist who declined to be named . Alawite villagers say authorities have been arming young men to fight the insurgency . Mutilated bodies of some Shabbiha men , handed over by security forces to their families for burial , served to incite sectarian hatred in those villages . Sectarian paranoia is evident , with Assad trusting only two elite units commanded by his brother Maher -- the 4th Armoured Division and the Republican Guard -- as well as secret police and Alawite militia , known as Shabbiha , to deal with dissent . `` The coherence -LRB- of the security forces -RRB- is already in question . Sectarianism is already a problem , the loyalty of other units can not be counted on , '' Rogan said . While the authorities blame the upheaval on a `` bunch of Islamists , '' the reality appears more complex . Some Syria-watchers say the protest movement is driven mainly by youths and includes rural Sunni tribes , nationalists , leftists , secularists and also Islamists , united in their goal of overthrowing an autocratic and corrupt government . Geographically , the protests have spread since March to many rural and tribal regions , cities such as Hama and Homs , and even to Damascus , although not on a huge scale in the capital . Security forces and Shabbiha militiamen , armed with metal bars , are everywhere . The army has deployed tanks around the main cities to keep out protesters from the countryside . `` The savagery of the regime has increased 180 degrees . The hostility against it has massively increased too among ordinary people , not just protesters . There are widescale arrests in all areas , in cities and villages , '' the Syrian journalist said . Residents said the Alawite units , though overstretched , have stepped up their offensive and are showing resilience in facing the growing demonstrations . The protest movement , however , is growing and showing no sign of dying down , residents add . In a country where once no one dared utter a word against the president , chants such as : `` Bashar you butcher we wo n't rest until we bury you '' show how fearless the activists have become . Graffiti on rubbish bins read : `` Bashar : this is your final grave . '' Toppling the system , analysts say , is hazardous because of Syria 's power structure under which Alawites hold key posts in the military and Assad family insiders run the key security bodies , tying senior officers closely to Assad 's own fate . Sarkis Naoum , an expert on Syrian affairs , said Assad was not likely to be overthrown quickly , but the conflict could develop into a bloody civil war . `` It is not clear how it would evolve and how much time it would take . The regime can not win and also the opposition can not win either , '' said Naoum , a columnist at Beirut 's an-Nahar daily . What complicates the Syrian scene is that the Assads will fight to the end rather than leave because they fear that their family and their sect would be targeted under Sunni rule . `` The Assads wo n't relinquish power . They are refusing reform because it will make them have to give up power , '' Naoum said . Rogan said that Assad 's departure was not imminent . `` It is a long way before we reach the point where Bashar has to go . The regime is a lot stronger than people like to think but Assad is weak and has no sense of leadership . '' The protests have virtually crippled Damascus . Shops open for a few hours during the day and close early . Business activity is grounded and many people have lost their jobs . The city , which once buzzed with night life , is tense and eerie after dark . Signs of stretched resources and a strained economy are very evident . The Syrian economy could prove to be Assad 's curse . With no end in sight to the crackdown on protesters , the country 's key revenue streams look shattered . A more marked decline in Syria 's economic health may force the regime to fall . After growing at an average of 5 percent over the last five years , the economy is forecast to contract as much as 3 percent this year as tourism , which accounts for 23 percent of Syria 's hard currency earnings , and foreign investment grind to a halt . With hotels almost empty and the growing likelihood of oil sanctions , Syria is desperately trying to retain local and foreign currency by increasing interest rates on deposits and curbing foreign currency sales . Tehran , which regards Syria as a close ally in a mainly Sunni-dominated region suspicious of non-Arab Shi'ite Iran , is reported to have come to his help in funds and expertise . Iran is considering offering $ 5.8 billion -LRB- 3.5 billion pound -RRB- in financial help , French business newspaper Les Echos said . Iran , which quashed its own pro-democracy youth movement after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re-election in 2009 , has sent experts to help the Syrian authorities monitor and jam satellite communication and the Internet , according to Ausama Monajed of the Syrian opposition . The opposition said the government had been finding it hard to monitor the activists ' communications until the Iranians stepped in , providing authorities with Chinese and North Korean equipment to intercept and eavesdrop on conversations . Monajed , spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Europe , said the opposition is lobbying to raise funds and rally world opinion to slap more sanctions against Assad and his aides . While close observers of Syria weigh the multiple scenarios , none of them appears to have a neat end . `` The sooner this mafia is gone the better , '' Rogan said . `` A lot worse can happen trying to get rid of these guys than we have seen already . '' Seale said : `` The more blood is spilt the more difficult is to find a solution . There has to be a negotiated solution of sort . If there is no solution there will be a civil war .

LONDON | Tue Jul 26 , 2011 3:56 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - George Osborne 's `` Age of Austerity '' mantra was the kind of tough medicine his Conservative party and voters wanted to hear as Britain dragged itself out of the financial crisis and faced up to a mountain of unsustainable debt . The son of a baronet and heir to a successful wallpaper business was key in placing a harsh austerity plan at the heart of his party 's 2010 election campaign and it paid off as voters turned on a 13-year-old Labor government . But there was one glaring hole in the argument . While avoiding credit downgrades was seen as the best way to stabilise any recovery , there was little evidence that a finance-starved private sector could make up for Osborne 's retrenchment in government spending . But the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government under Prime Minister David Cameron knows it must stick to its guns in the hope that the economy will improve by the time of the 2015 election . Dismal figures for the second quarter of this year on Tuesday -- growth of just 0.2 percent after the economy effectively flatlined in the previous six months -- may have just called Osborne 's bluff . `` We were somehow promised this double mantra of cutting debt but also miraculously sustained and ever rising economic growth -- it 's in a dream world that you can achieve these things , '' said Jonathan Tonge , professor of politics at the University of Liverpool . `` The jury is still out on this coalition government . People do n't necessarily trust its economic strategy to deliver and people are still suspicious that there is a slight ` fetish-isation ' of spending cuts because there are Conservatives involved . '' Where Osborne had so easily sold his austerity and growth plans last year , the media-shy Conservative is now finding it hard to explain why it does not seem to be working . Many major Western economies are struggling to get going again after the credit crunch , but Britain is lagging behind . Economists polled by Reuters earlier this month showed a consensus expecting 2.5 percent growth in the United States , 3.4 percent growth in Germany and 1.3 percent in Britain . The government 's deficit plan -- to all but eliminate a budget deficit of about 10 percent of national output over four years -- is based on forecasts for 1.7 percent this year . Osborne has so far managed to avoid much of the criticism . Lesser ministers have been wheeled out , often from the smaller Lib Dem side of the coalition , to announce austerity measures and then face the wrath of protesters . Like his former Labor nemesis Gordon Brown -- who ruled the Treasury for a decade before taking over from Tony Blair as prime minister in 2007 -- Osborne has learned the knack of disappearing and leaving others to face the music . Daily Telegraph columnist Jeremy Warner compares him to TS Eliot 's Macavity the mystery cat , marvelling at his `` ability to float , like the fakir in Eliot 's Macavity , above the wreckage of the coalition 's first , turbulent year in office . '' But dangers lie ahead for a man who is said to have his heart set on the top political job and is widely recognized as a strategic force within the government . Questions have been asked about his role in the hiring of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as Cameron 's communications chief after the phone hacking scandal engulfed Rupert Murdoch 's British media operations . The Conservatives have been accused of getting too cosy with Murdoch 's empire in their quest for political glory as have their Labor opponents . Osborne has not escaped the backlash . Perhaps more worryingly , reports suggest Cameron is becoming frustrated with the lack of economic growth . This could be the year it all goes sour for the Cameron-Osborne axis of power , although Osborne dismissed those fears on Tuesday . `` Their past comradeship offers no guarantees , '' said Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities . `` Latest reports that the prime minister is not happy with the chancellor 's performance could presage deep trouble for the coalition government . `` There is much concern in some quarters that the shortfall in growth ... will result in an overshoot in government borrowing relative to budget plans . This can not be ruled out . '' Any sustained slippage in the coalition 's deficit reduction plans could see Britain at the mercy of the credit ratings agencies once again . A risk of a downgrade would be a disaster for Osborne who promised to safeguard Britain 's top notch triple-A rating . At the same time , deficit hawks say that going soft on spending cuts would prove just as disastrous . `` If he goes off track with the spending cuts , then of course the markets could pounce , '' said Richard Wellings , deputy editorial director at the Institute of Economic Affairs told Reuters Insider . `` I think really the current spending cuts are the minimum that are credible for the markets . '' It may not look good this week , but there is time for Osborne 's gamble to pay off , even if success could prolong Cameron 's reign and reduce his chances of leading the Conservatives . Financial markets were pleasantly surprised by the meager growth in the second quarter , having gambled on an even weaker number , and most polls show the public back Osborne 's plans . Most analysts agree that any climbdown would be political suicide . `` Let 's be quite clear , weak GDP growth does not mean that we should resort to Plan B with fiscal policy , '' said Graeme Leach , chief economist at the Institute of Directors . -LRB- Reporting by Matt Falloon ; editing by Elizabeth Piper -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "169", "dct": "2011-07-29", "dates": ["2011-07-29", "2011-07-29", "2011-07-01", "2011-06-01", "2011-05-01", "2011-07-01", "2011-05-01", "2006-01-01", "2010-01-01", "2011-04-01", "2011-03-01"], "text": "LONDON | Fri Jul 29 , 2011 11:36 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - British fund managers are heading to domestic stocks and bonds as mounting worries about sovereign debt in the euro zone and United States add to the UK 's allure as a safe haven in a volatile world , a Reuters poll shows . A monthly survey of 14 investment managers found the average allocation in global equity portfolios to the UK increased 3 percentage points to 15.6 percent in July from a month earlier . Allocations to the euro zone and the United States , where fears of possible defaults on creaking sovereign debt burdens have rattled markets , both fell during the month . The average exposure to U.S. equities slid to 41.3 percent , from 42.1 percent , while euro zone allocations were at 14.9 percent , from 16.3 percent a month earlier . Performance figures from Lipper earlier this month showed macro-economic shocks -- from the euro zone debt crisis to May 's commodities sell-off -- had helped lift the performance of domestically focused funds during the first half of 2011 . An annual survey published this week by British funds lobby group the IMA shows equity allocations to the UK have been declining steadily in recent years , from around 59 percent in 2006 to 42.6 percent in 2010 . Several of the managers and chief investment officers surveyed by Reuters said a recent deal to make private investors shoulder some of the burden of bailing out Greece to stop contagion is unlikely to resolve the crisis conclusively . `` Crises , packages and tactical rallies will follow -- ultimately radical , comprehensive , broad scale solutions will be needed in large size , '' said Andrew Milligan , head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments -LRB- SL . `` Remain moderately light in the euro and certain peripheral bonds , buy export orientated equities , but in particular prepare portfolios for considerable future volatility . '' Shares in British companies , which aggressively cut costs in readiness for the economic downturn , have emerged as an unlikely safe haven in recent weeks on account of strong balance sheets and resilient earnings . But UK fixed income is also popular , the poll shows , with allocations to Britain in global bond portfolios rising to 37.1 percent from 34.4 percent a month earlier . The poll echoes sentiment on currency markets in which Britain 's growing appeal as an island of relative fiscal health in spite of a still sluggish economy has driven sterling to six week highs against the dollar . Meanwhile , allocations in balanced portfolios by asset class remained broadly unchanged from a month earlier with average exposure to equities at 52.6 percent and bonds at 23.5 percent . Cash holdings were at 3.7 percent with 2.6 percent in property and 17.6 percent in alternative investments . `` This is not a time for the faint of heart , but bravery will be rewarded , '' said Lee Robertson , Chief Executive of Investment Quorum , a wealth manager based in London .

NEW YORK | Sun Jul 31 , 2011 4:58 pm BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Ford Motor Co -LRB- F. N -RRB- shares may rise 25 percent as the company cuts debt , rolls out new models and tries to expand in China and India , where it has been a laggard , Barron 's said in its August 1 edition . Unlike rivals General Motors and Chrysler , Ford was able to avoid bankruptcy and government bailouts by taking on billions of dollars of debt in 2006 , when capital markets were still open . According to Barron 's , Ford has paid off $ 9 billion -LRB- 5 billion pounds -RRB- of the $ 23 billion of debt it then took on , could pay off another $ 2 billion by year end , and should regain investment-grade credit ratings once uncertainties over labor talks with the United Auto Workers begin to dissipate . The newspaper said the Dearborn , Michigan-based company has this year added U.S. market share at the expense of Japanese automakers that suffered from supply problems stemming from that country 's earthquake and tsunami . It said Ford is spending for the U.S. market on new Lincoln models , a make-over for its mid-size Fusion sedan , and more efficient engines for its Explorer and Edge models . Ford is also planning to launch 16 new cars in China and India within four years , hoping to add share in two of the world 's fastest-growing markets , the newspaper added . China and India are also the world 's most populous markets , with a combined population of roughly 2.5 billion . On Monday , Ford reported its eighth straight quarterly net profit , as revenue increased 13 percent to $ 35.5 billion . Its shares closed Friday at $ 12.21 , near the low end of its 52-week range of $ 10.95 to $ 18.97 .

FRANKFURT\\/PARIS | Mon Aug 1 , 2011 6:19 pm BST FRANKFURT\\/PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - European aerospace group EADS -LRB- EAD . PA -RRB- kept up a hot pace of acquisitions with a $ 960 million -LRB- 589.9 million pounds -RRB- cash deal to buy satellite communications firm Vizada on Monday , chasing steadier sales from high-value services . The purchase , from private equity owner Apax France , was flagged by Reuters on Sunday and adds to a string of deals designed to help the Airbus parent firm dispose of surplus cash . Although Vizada is based in Paris , a contract with the U.S. Army will give Franco-German EADS an extra toe-hold in the United States where efforts to expand have met mixed success . Vizada provides communications services to 200,000 users in the maritime , aviation and defense sectors and will become part of EADS ' Astrium space business . EADS shares initially rose but dipped 0.9 percent to 23.98 euros in late trading while still outperforming a volatile market . EADS said the deal would boost its earnings per share and provide `` significant '' synergies . It did not give a timeframe or amount . `` The key point is synergies . Vizada has high-value products aimed at professionals and its margins can boost EADS earnings . It also makes sense in terms of some pieces of technology that EADS might soon need , '' said Kepler analyst Christophe Menard . A two-year mid-Atlantic search to locate the black boxes of a crashed Air France jetliner sparked calls for satellite-based alternatives for collecting data , Menard said . However people involved in the deal said Vizada would fit mainly into the existing business at Astrium , which already provides secure communications to Britain and German military . EADS wants to double the share of services in its revenues to 25 percent and reduce its dependence on Airbus commercial sales to 50 percent of revenues by 2020 from 66 percent now . In June , EADS bought Canadian repair firm Vector Aerospace for some 450 million euros -LRB- 393.65 million pounds -RRB- and last week Airbus announced a $ 500 million bid for Danish parts distributor Satair SATA . Airbus also agreed to buy Metron Aviation , which supplies services for air traffic control , for an undisclosed sum . Analysts have backed the logic of acquisitions but expressed concerns EADS may be tempted to overpay to shake off cash . `` I would say there is a risk of that , '' said Nomura Equity Research analyst Jason Adams . `` Given the Satair one and the multiple they are paying for this , at some point the investors will be a bit concerned if they think EADS is overpaying for acquisitions . '' Oddo Securities analyst Yan Derocles said he found the valuation of both the Vizada and Satair deals `` rather high '' . According to EADS , Vizada expects to generate around $ 660 million in revenue and $ 95 million in earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation this year . Vizada was formed in 2007 from satellite services held by France Telecom -LRB- FTE . PA -RRB- and Norway 's Telenor -LRB- TEL. . The deal is EADS 's second-largest acquisition after a 2.75 billion euro buyout of BAE Systems ' -LRB- BAES . L -RRB- 20 percent stake in Airbus in 2006 . Under pressure from analysts to look at better uses for an 11 billion euro net cash surplus , EADS has long said it is ready to spend up to 2 billion euros to fund external growth . But the pace quickened after it lost a contest with Boeing -LRB- BA . N -RRB- , the world 's largest aerospace company , to supply air tankers to the Pentagon in March . The setback removed a chance to make the U.S. a bigger launchpad for internal growth . EADS has said it would be prepared to look at European companies with a foothold in U.S. defense to gain entry . Apax Partners said the deal marked its third exit in the telecom sector in two months following sales of Prosodie and Outremer Telecom . It and Vizada were both advised by UBS . EADS was advised by Messier Partners .

The opinions expressed are his own . A young Syrian called Ausama Monajed was on a train to London . One of his hobbies was reading e-books . On this trip , he picked Gene Sharp s From Dictatorship to Democracy , which maps out strategies for using non-violent struggle to bring down repressive regimes . Monajed , now one of the revolution s leaders outside the country , became engrossed . It was as if I was reading an exact description of Syria , Monajed told Reuters Breakingviews . The next thing he noticed was a conductor tapping him on the shoulder . The train had arrived at its terminus in Euston Station . He asked me if I wanted to return where I d come from . Sharp , who was inspired by India s Mohandas Gandhi and who himself influenced some of the activists behind the Egyptian revolution , stresses that a dictator s power isn t monolithic . It relies on the army , police , civil service , business and , indeed , the wider society just to function . Activists should therefore analyze those pillars of support and systematically undermine them . The best way to do this is not to fight dictators with their own weapons - matching violence with violence in a struggle they are likely to lose but to use non-violent tactics . It is much harder for the security forces to kill unarmed civilians than those who fire back at you . The more brutally the regime represses them , the shakier its pillars of support become . Eventually , the violence boomerangs on the regime and destroys it . Sharp makes clear that non-violent struggles normally don t succeed through spontaneous combustion . They need planning and training . Most importantly , it is vital to maintain nonviolent discipline which isn t easy when activists are being killed , tortured and detained . Monajed , now 31 , was smitten . An economist by training , he had hoped that Syria s president Bashar al-Assad would be a reformer when he succeeded his father Hafez Assad , who died in 2000 . Monajed worked for the United National Development Programme and then the European Commission on development programs inside Syria . But then he became disillusioned and joined the opposition . After being arrested several times , Monajed quit the country in 2005 and has never returned . He says he has become one of the regime s most wanted people after writing an article in the Washington Post this April . This said the U.S. government had several years ago funded Barada TV , a London-based channel beaming anti-regime programming into Syria which he had helped establish . After coming across Sharp s work , Monajed studied previous nonviolent revolutions , especially the Serbs overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 . He went to see Sharp , now an 83-year-old academic , in Boston . He also wrote a master s degree dissertation on the role of the internet and information technology in non-violent struggle with a focus on Syria . In 2007 Monajed organized a meeting with some disaffected Syrian friends in London . He says it is too risky to reveal their names . They decided to get trained in the techniques of nonviolent struggle and use that as the basis for training others . We brought Syrians out of the country and trained them in nonviolent techniques , Monajed says . The idea was to train leaders and send them back to train others . They found it hard to recruit volunteers . They were told nonviolent struggle wouldn t work in Syria because of religious and geopolitical factors . In the end , they managed to train around 100 people . Then came the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions . The whole Middle East was electrified . Syrians began to think they too might get their freedom . People contacted Monajed s group , saying that now they understood what it was advocating . The first protest took place on March 15 in the Hamidiyeh bazaar in the heart of old Damascus . They chose Hamidiyeh because it is a covered market . There were only about 40 protesters but their chants , calling for freedom , echoed off the iron roof making it seem like there were more . Because the bazaar was crowded , it was hard to distinguish who was a protestor and who was just an onlooker - again exaggerating their numbers . The next protests took place spontaneously in Deraa , near the border with Jordan , after 15 school children had been arrested for scrawling anti-regime graffiti on walls . These protests were much bigger , with thousands eventually taking part . The security services fired on unarmed civilians . The killing began in earnest . After that , protests started mushrooming around the country . Facebook pages were created ; people communicated via Twitter ; protesters took video clips with their mobile phones and posted them on YouTube . Everything was happening faster than Monajed and his colleagues had imagined . Most of the protests had nothing to do with them . The challenge was how to put some order into the revolution . An early priority was to set up a virtual operation center , staffed by dozens of volunteers outside the country , feeding what was happening on the ground to the world outside . Most foreign journalists were quickly kicked out of the country , including one Reuters journalist who was beaten up by the secret police , so it was important to get information out to the international media . Many of the most popular internet pages were coordinated through a new body , The Coalition of Syrian Pages . On the ground , local coordinating committees started emerging in different neighborhoods . They organize campaigns , raise money to cover living costs of the families of those who had been killed or detained , and help communicate what is happening in their area . The Coalition of Syrian Pages has gradually taken a bigger role in coordinating activity . It consists of about 20-25 people , some inside the country and some abroad . Monajed won t reveal their names . The authorities don t know who all the members of the Coalition are or where they are , he explains . One of the current priorities is to have a strategic plan that includes action on the ground and international lobbying for things like an oil embargo . This has involved coordinating the work of the activists , most of whom are young , with the traditional cohort of opposition made up of politicians , lawyers and human rights campaigners , many of whom signed the anti-regime Damascus Declaration in 2005 . Initially there wasn t a plan ; just an idea of demonstrating until the regime falls , says Monajed . Now , with the Coalition , we are trying to guide the effort in a strategic manner to knock down the -LRB- regime s -RRB- pillars of support . A particularly sensitive issue , which didn t exist in either Egypt or Tunisia , is the potential for sectarian conflict . Assad is an Alawite , a minority Shi ite Muslim sect . Many of the top positions in government , the military and business are also held by Alawites . But most of the population is Sunni Muslim . Given this background , the regime s four main pillars of support in order of importance , according to Monajed , are : the security forces including secret police ; the Alawites ; army generals , especially those who are Alawite ; and the Sunni business elite , many of whom have prospered since Assad partly liberalised the economy . In order to knock down these pillars , it is essential to keep the campaign peaceful , says Monajed . People don t want a Libyanisation of the situation , he says , referring to the civil war across the Mediterranean Sea . So demonstrators give roses to the army and don t insult them in their chants . The underlying message they are trying to send to the top generals is : We differentiate between you and the security service . Some soldiers have mutinied after being ordered to kill unarmed protesters . The message to the Alawites is that they are being held hostage by the Assad regime - and it can t be in their interests to engage in a war of elimination . The protesters have used chants stressing the unity between Sunni , Alawites and Christians -LRB- another minority -RRB- and called on Alawite and Christian generals to lead the transition to democracy . Despite this , there are signs of sectarian violence . There has already been at least one case of a group of Alawites being killed -- in retaliation for a Sunni elder being killed and cut into pieces , according to Monajed . That , in turn , provoked a ferocious backlash against Sunnis in the city of Homs . Meanwhile , the message to the business community is that they won t continue to prosper under Assad . The Syrian pound has fallen on the black market , tourism is dead , consumer demand has been thwacked and the economy is shrinking . What about the secret police ? This is the toughest part of the regime to crack , according to Monajed . He doesn t have a simple message for them . Rather , he predicts that , as the revolution goes on , the regime will get tired and exhausted . The top generals may then liaise with Alawite leaders , arrest Assad and the top security chiefs , and form a transitional council with members from all parts of the community . While strategizing is important , nothing will happen without action on the ground . Although protests have been the most visible tactic , they are not the only method being deployed . There are low-risk tactics for those who don t want to go on protests where they could get killed . One is to release freedom balloons at a specific time in a particular city , to give people courage that they are not alone . Another is to open their windows at night time and play revolutionary rap songs . Activists have drawn up lists of shame of businesses , actors , intellectuals , imams and priests who are considered too close to the regime . These are used to determine boycotts and strikes . Campaigners have also produced lists of government informers , according to the Financial Times . Their aim is to put pressure on them and isolate them . However , there are also reports of at least two informers being killed . The Assad regime has been far from idle . As of last week , 1,634 civilians had been killed , according to Avaaz , the human rights group . Then on Sunday tanks were sent into the central Syrian city of Hama , in what looks like an attempt to break the protesters ' morale before the holy month of Ramadan , which has now started . Demonstrations have been particularly big on Fridays after people have gathered to pray in mosques . Some protesters have been saying that Ramadan could be like a month of Fridays . As the regime 's violence ramps up , it would be natural for the protesters either to lose courage or to take up arms themselves . The challenge for Monajed 's group will be to ensure that neither happens . If they succeed , they will then have a chance to witness whether a nonviolent struggle can really bring a brutal regime tumbling down . Revolutions -- for better or worse -- are flash points in the process of human evolution which can be traced back to advances in technology . History shows that to be a universal truth . For the so called `` Western World , '' the advent of written Language and Law is the story of Moses . The printing press made it possible for many more humans to have their own copy of the Bible . Once the word got out the next period of unrest gave us the Protestant reformation . Fast forward to Vietnam . As soon as video of the mayhem became television fodder , government propaganda insisting that people on the other side of the world are somehow less human became repugnant . The Soviet Union disintegrated because their citizens desire for Blue Jeans and MTV made it impossible to maintain the illusion that the West lived in abject poverty . Likewise the Internet and World Wide travel have forced the sun shine of truth into every hell hole on the planet . One person with a cell phone can reach out and touch the hearts of more people then the President of the United States . America , China , Russia and even Saudi Arabia have had to appease citizens opinion by saying Syria 's is a dictatorship that has to go even though they know full well that such sentiments may be applied at home as well . What we are witnessing is a none economic kind of creative destruction that will bring down all the pillars of false power -- government corruption , fiat monitory schemes and religious dogma . The American revolution lead to years of instability and adjustments as the theory of individual sovereignty met the reality of human existence . Without the isolation and vast open lands giving the US space and time to experiment ,1776 might just have been another Tienanmen Square or Prague Spring . Today the world is moving forward a bit . Let us hope there is enough room or someone hurries up and opens the next frontier -- Space -- so we can catch our breath while figuring out how to live and prosper without ANY evil enemy empires , local government mafias or in-deflatable paper dollars .

NEW YORK | Mon Aug 1 , 2011 9:55 pm BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Swiss franc soared on Monday and the U.S. dollar rallied against the euro , with demand for safe-haven currencies set to continue on concerns about slowing global economic growth and a possible cut of the United States ' credit rating . U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in two years in July , the Institute for Supply Management said , casting doubt on expectations the faltering recovery would quickly regain steam . In Europe , the euro zone manufacturing PMI also fell in July to a two year low and perhaps more worrying , China 's official government PMI dropped to its lowest level in two years also . Initial euphoria about the U.S. Congress agreeing on a deal to raise the government 's statutory borrowing limit faded as investors worried that the country might still lose its triple-A credit rating even though the risk of a default appeared to be off the table . `` The undercurrents of risk aversion still remain very strong , '' said Samarjit Shankar , managing director of global foreign exchange strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston . `` Existing riskier positions that were funded in the yen , Swiss franc and dollars are being unwound , which is why all three currencies have been gaining relative to the others . '' The Swiss franc climbed to record highs against both the euro and dollar , continuing a recent trend as investors fretted about sovereign debt crises on both sides of the Atlantic . `` The Swiss franc still stands out head and shoulders above the other so-called safe-haven currencies , '' Shankar said . The euro plumbed a record low at 1.1030 Swiss francs on trading platform EBS , and last traded down 1.3 percent at 1.1171 francs . The dollar hit as low as 0.77323 Swiss franc , before pulling back to 0.7834 , down 0.2 percent on the day . U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said debt limit increase legislation would be completed in the Senate by Tuesday , but uncertainty about its fate in the more fractious Republican-controlled House of Representatives kept markets nervous . The cuts proposed over the next ten years also fall short of the $ 4 trillion set by some ratings agencies as the threshold needed to avert a U.S. ratings downgrade . `` The markets are unsure about how this will play out and it is down to the wire , so the market is cautious right now , '' said Jessica Hoversen , FX analyst at MF Global in New York . The euro fell to $ 1.41847 and last traded at $ 1.4260 , down 0.9 percent on the day . Yields on Italian and Spanish bonds continued to rise , suggesting persistent worries about the risk of contagion in the euro zone crisis and adding to risk aversion the market . The dollar fell as low as 76.29 yen on EBS , its weakest since coordinated intervention by major central banks in mid-March to weaken the surging Japanese currency . The record low for the pair was at 76.25 set in mid-March . The yen also jumped against the euro and Australian and New Zealand dollars . The U.S. currency briefly surged against the yen in morning New York trade , though traders said the move did not appear to be related to intervention by Japanese authorities . A trader said the jump in the dollar against the yen was partly due to a big order from a large Japanese bank under 76.50 yen and was part of the normal flow of the market . An official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance in Tokyo said that while the office is aware of currency movements , he can not comment on the dollar\\/yen move . Still , the intraday spike heightened the market 's alertness for potential official yen selling , helping the dollar rebound to 77.17 yen , up 0.6 percent on the day . Analysts said a slew of key U.S. economic releases in the coming days , including Friday 's monthly jobs report , should keep risk appetite subdued . Against a basket of currencies , the dollar index was up 0.6 percent at 74.314 . .

More than 200 people were killed when Guatemalan soldiers attacked the northern village of Las Dos Erres in 1982 at the height of Guatemala 's civil war . The soldiers were given 30 years of prison for the deaths of each of the 201 killed in the attack . The court also found them guilty of crimes against human rights , adding another 30 years to their sentences . The soldiers -- Carlos Carias , Manuel Pop , Reyes Collin Gualip and Daniel Martinez Hernandez -- were all special forces officers at the time of the massacre . The officers , in an elite unit known as the Kaibiles , went to the village in December 1982 and shot , strangled and bludgeoned the villagers to death with sledgehammers . Guatemala 's Public Ministry said the army ordered the unit to the village to look for missing military weapons , believed to be in the hands of left-wing guerillas . Last month , the United States deported former Guatemalan soldier Pedro Pimentel Rios , 54 , for his alleged role in the Las Dos Erres massacre . Guatemala 's Public Ministry will hold a separate hearing for Rios . The ruling center-left administration of President Alvaro Colom has been under pressure by human rights organizations to bring war criminals to justice in Guatemala , one of the poorest and most lawless countries in Latin America . Nearly a quarter of a million people were killed in Guatemala 's 1960-1996 civil war and many thousands are still missing . -LRB- Reporting by Herbert Hernandez ; Editing by Eric Beech -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "184", "dct": "2011-08-05", "dates": ["2011-08-05"], "text": "Amateur video shows aftermath of Syria shelling -LRB- 1:37 -RRB- Aug. 5 - Amateur video purports to show protesters removing the body of a dead man and the aftermath of shelling in the Syrian city of Hama .

A small settlement in the desert , Bir al-Ghanam is also the closest point the rebels have come to Muammar Gaddafi 's stronghold in the capital , lending it a strategic role in the rebels ' six-month campaign to end Gaddafi 's rule . Rebel commanders in the region said on Saturday they had seized control of Bir al-Ghanam in an offensive in which four anti-Gaddafi fighters had died . Taking the town -- which lies on a highway leading north to the Mediterranean coast and on to Tripoli -- would break weeks of stalemate during which rebels have been unable to make big advances despite NATO air strikes on government forces . Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali Al-Mahmoudi said on Sunday that rebels , under NATO air cover , had seized Bir al-Ghanam temporarily but they had been driven out by local volunteers and Libyan forces . `` This is exactly what happened in Bir al-Ghanam , which is back in the hands of the honorable and brave local tribes ... and under the legitimate control of the government of Libya , '' he told a news conference in Tripoli . But a local commander rejected that version of events . `` Gaddafi is a liar because Bir al-Ghanam is under our control , '' Colonel Juma Ibrahim , a rebel commander from the nearby town of Zintan , told Reuters . `` We are still in the same position we were yesterday . '' He said in the past 24 hours rebel forces had , in fact , pushed about 10 km -LRB- 6 miles -RRB- northeast of Bir al-Ghanam , and were now planning to push towards the coastal town of Zawiyah . Zawiyah , which lies 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , has been the scene of two uprisings which were smashed by Gaddafi 's security forces . A large contingent of the rebels fighting around Bir al-Ghanam are from Zawiyah . It was not immediately possible to verify independently who was in control of Bir al-Ghanam . Most analysts say Gaddafi will eventually be forced to relinquish power if NATO states and their rebel allies maintain the pressure on him by starving him of weapons , fuel and cash and attacking his forces . However , some alliance members are unsettled by how long the Libyan campaign is dragging on and how much it is costing , especially at a time of economic uncertainty . If NATO wavers , this could give Gaddafi an opportunity to hold on to power . For now though , there is no sign of a let-up in the air campaign , led by French and British warplanes . A Reuters reporter in Tripoli said there were multiple strikes overnight in the southeast of the city . After the initial explosions , there were smaller blasts on the ground and flames shooting into the air , suggesting the target contained highly flammable material . Britain said on Saturday -- while rebels were attacking Bir al-Ghanam -- its aircraft had been in the area and attacked two ammunitions stores , a military headquarters and a position supporting government rocket launchers . In a separate operation on Sunday , British Apache attack helicopters took off from a warship in the Mediterranean Sea and fired Hellfire missiles at military vehicles in Al-Watyah , the site of a government air base 170 km south-west of Tripoli , spokesman Major General Nick Pope said in a statement . Potentially adding to pressure on Gaddafi , Tripoli has been experiencing power shortages in the past few days and these have been growing worse . Libyan state television appealed on Sunday to people to conserve energy by switching off air conditioners in mosques and offices when they are not in use . Because of the blackouts , many residents have no air conditioning during the peak summer heat and no refrigeration as they prepare for evening meals during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . Some areas of the Libyan capital are getting as little as four hours of power a day , residents said this week . Mohamed Abu Ajeela Rashid , a former Libyan health minister who is now a senior hospital doctor , said power was cut while he was performing surgery . He said he had to complete the operation by the light of his cell phone . Libyan government officials have said the problems will be fixed within the next few days . They blame NATO for attacking electricity lines , but an official with the alliance denied there had been any such strikes . In eastern Libya , where rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces are fighting along another front , rebel commanders said they were making a big push to capture the coastal oil town of Brega , about 780 km from Tripoli . But they said progress was slow because Gaddafi 's forces had laid minefields around the town . `` We do n't want to lose anybody so we 're moving slowly but surely , '' said rebel spokesman Mohammad Zawawi . Pope Benedict , giving his Sunday blessing from the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo near Rome , appealed for an end to violence in the Middle East . `` My thoughts also go to Libya , where the use of arms has not resolved the situation , '' he said . `` I urge the international organizations and those with political and military responsibilities to relaunch the search for a peace plan for the country with conviction and determination , through talks and constructive dialogue .

City led 2-0 at halftime but Chris Smalling pulled one back , Nani equalised with a sublime finish and the Portuguese winger struck again deep into stoppage time as the Premier League champions avenged last season 's FA Cup semi-final defeat by their neighbors . `` It was a very good performance in terms of our football , I could n't believe we were 2-0 down at halftime , '' United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports . `` But the players kept their heads , kept playing football and got the result they deserved . They have courage to keep the ball and are not admitted by tough tackling . '' Ferguson 's United have made a habit of coming from behind to snatch important victories and the catalyst against City was the manager 's decision at halftime to replace the experienced Rio Ferdinand , Nemanja Vidic and Michael Carrick . New signing Phil Jones , Jonny Evans and young midfielder Tom Cleverley were thrown into the fray and their energy and enthusiasm were vital as United tore into the City defense . `` The difference the young lads made was outstanding , '' United striker Wayne Rooney said . `` We never know when a game is finished . Of course they are going to try and fight us for the title . They scored two goals from nowhere but we showed character to win the game . '' Ferguson has so far failed to sign a replacement for the retired Paul Scholes but the 21-year-old Cleverley 's neat distribution and tactical awareness hinted that he could provide at least a temporary solution . One concern for Ferguson was the performance of his new Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea who was stranded when Joleon Lescott nodded in David Silva 's teasing free kick and slow to react when Edin Dzeko 's ambitious 30-metre strike flew past him just before halftime . `` It was bending a bit , it 's difficult to say if he should have done better , '' Ferguson said . City manager Roberto Mancini , charged with the task of ending United 's domination of English soccer and bringing the league title to the club for the first time since 1968 , admitted his side had been outplayed . `` They were better than us but sometimes in football if you can not score you give the other team a chance . We were 2-0 up so it is not good to lose from this position .

On Sunday , one of Assad 's advisers warned Davutoglu would be given short shrift after Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said his minister would deliver a `` decisive message , '' having seen past entreaties to halt the violence ignored . A Turkish official said Davutoglu would repeat the earlier calls . But the official did not want to venture into what Turkey will do if its words continue to fall on deaf ears in neighboring Syria . Still , if Davutoglu returns empty-handed , Erdogan faces the prospect of ditching a friendship he has carefully nurtured over the past decade , leaving Assad more isolated and dependent on Iranian support than ever . Bahadir Dincer , Middle East expert at the International Strategic Research Organization in Ankara , said he expected no change from the Syrian government given the comments from Damascus ahead of Davutoglu 's visit . `` Turkey will have to seriously consider its ties with Syria , '' Dincer said . `` It has been a white page for a decade now , The recent tension turned it gray , and we 'll see tomorrow if the relations are entering a red-page era . '' Having almost gone to war in the late 1990s over Syria harboring Kurdish militants , the friendship became a virtual poster-child for Erdogan 's foreign policy of `` zero problems with neighbors . '' Erdogan has holidayed with Assad , their cabinets have held joint meetings , Turkey has become Syria 's biggest trading partner , the neighbors have visa-free travel between them , and Turkey tried to broker a peace deal between Syria and Israel . NO GOING OUT ON A LIMB The relationship with Syria has withered as Erdogan tried to encourage Assad , in vain , to make democratic reforms and end the repressive one-party rule of his Baath movement . Events in the Arab Spring of popular protests , according to Sinan Ulgen in a paper published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , have shown Ankara now wants to be on the right side of history and is ready to stand up for issues like human rights even where it imperils ties with incumbent leaders . The patience Erdogan has shown so far with Assad stands in contrast to the speed with which he advised Hosni Mubarak to quit as president of Egypt when street protests erupted there early this year , but that patience appears to have run out . There is genuine outrage in Turkey , a largely secular Muslim country like Syria but also a multi-party democracy , over the brutal repression unleashed since pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the neighboring Arab state last March . In June , after more than 10,000 Syrians fled to Turkey to escape attacks by security forces , Erdogan described the killing of Syrian civilians as acts of savagery . Yet , his government -- like Syria 's Arab neighbors , however upset they have become about Assad 's behavior , underlined by the recall of several Gulf ambassadors on Monday -- is unlikely to take any unilateral action against Damascus , according to analysts of Turkish foreign policy in the Middle East . With the international community divided over what to do about Syria , Turkey is unlikely to go out on a limb , either through economic sanctions or military action . `` Turkey will not go to the lengths of unilateral economic sanctions . It has always argued that sanctions hurt people , not regimes , '' said Semih Idiz , a columnist focused on foreign policy at Milliyet newspaper . One big investment that could be vulnerable to a freeze in bilateral relations is a joint multi-billion-dollar dam project dubbed `` Friendship Dam , '' whose groundbreaking was attended by leaders of the two countries in February . Turkey is also likely to resist any pressure to create a buffer zone inside Syrian territory , though it is reportedly a scenario that the Turkish military has made contingencies for . `` Turkey will not do anything unilateral militarily unless there is a massive spillover effect from what 's happening in Syria -- a spillover of a humanitarian nature , or a threat to national security , '' Idiz said . Other analysts said Turkey should avoid being drawn into any military intervention in Syria just to please Western powers , as it would backfire on efforts to end ethnic Kurds ' long-running insurgency in southeast Turkey . `` Turkey may limit its trade and diplomatic ties with Syria . But , even if Turkey does n't take such steps , its clear message and attitude toward the Syrian administration will be a boost of morale to protesters , '' Dincer said . Syrians living in exile have flocked to Turkey , without any apparent encouragement from the Turkish government , for a series of meetings aimed at uniting opposition to Assad . Any move by Turkish officials to engage the Syrian opposition would further alienate Damascus from Ankara . And whereas Saudi Arabia withdrew its envoy to Damascus on Monday , Idiz doubted whether Turkey would want to be seen following Riyadh 's lead , lest its actions be seen through any sectarian prism . Assad and the ruling clique in the Ba'athist Party hail from Syria 's minority Alawite community , a sect close to Iran 's dominant Shi'ites , while the majority of Syrians are Sunni . Mostly Sunni Saudi Arabia sent troops to Bahrain in March to help stifle unrest among the emirate 's Shi'ite majority . While most of Turkey 's population are also Sunni , it also has a small Alawite minority , and Erdogan 's government has steadfastly sought to avoid stirring sectarian issues .

In less than 24 hours , the island kingdom of Bahrain and oil-rich neighbor Kuwait followed Saudi Arabia 's lead by summoning their ambassadors from Damascus `` for consultations . '' Saudi Arabia , an absolute monarchy normally loath to criticize other Arab autocrats but now wary of giving an opening to reform elements at home , pulled its envoy late on Sunday . King Abdullah , in an extraordinary statement read on Al Arabiya television , said Syria 's fierce military crackdown on nearly five months of demonstrations for more political freedoms had `` nothing to do with religion , or values , or ethics . '' Abdullah , who has approved billions of dollars in handouts to Saudi citizens this year in a move analysts said was aimed at buffering his monarchy from political reform pressure , issued a stern warning that Syria must be open to change . `` Syria should think wisely before it 's too late and issue and enact reforms , '' he said . `` Either it chooses wisdom on its own or it will be pulled down into the depths of turmoil and loss . '' `` The action of Gulf states has served to isolate the Assad regime in the Arab world , thereby signaling a major strategic shift in the region : From tacit support of the Syrian regime 's action to outright condemnation , '' said Michael Stephens , analyst at the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- based in Doha . While unlikely to lead to intervention in Syria , the Gulf comments marked the sharpest Arab criticism leveled against any Arab state since a wave of protests began rocking the Middle East in January , toppling veteran rulers in Tunisia and Egypt . On Monday , Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed al-Sabah told reporters in parliament that he would meet his counterparts across the Gulf to discuss conditions in Syria . `` When the number of innocent people killed exceeds 2,000 , it is something totally unacceptable , '' he said , while ruling out any military action against the fellow Arab country . Hours later , Bahrain , which itself suppressed a protest movement in March , joined growing condemnation of Syria when Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled al-Khalifa announced the recall of his country 's ambassador . `` Bahrain has summoned its ambassador for consultation and stresses the importance of prudent action , '' he posted on his Twitter account . Apart from Libya 's civil war , Syria 's military crackdown has been the most violent outgrowth of unrest in the Arab world this year . On Monday , tanks extended operations to crush protesters in Syria 's Sunni Muslim tribal heartland . Assad 's government says it is fighting criminals and armed extremists who have provoked violence by attacking its troops . Syrian rights activists and Western countries say Assad 's forces have attacked peaceful protesters . But sharp words against Syria by Gulf states are unlikely at this time to be followed by any decisive action . Analysts expect Gulf governments to stop short of supporting intervention in Syria as they did against distant Libya , where the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have sent planes to back NATO air strikes . In ruling out military action , Kuwait echoed an Arab League statement earlier on Monday saying that the pan-Arab body would use persuasion rather than `` drastic measures '' to press for an end to Syria 's bloodshed . Despite a lack of appetite for military moves , Saudi Arabia has played a `` game changer '' role in bringing Gulf states to heap pressure on another discredited Arab leader to quit , Yemen 's Ali Abdullah Saleh , RUSI 's Stephens said . Qatar , which has sought to lead Arab diplomacy as the unrest spreads , was the first to recall its envoy to Syria in July . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

REUTERS\\/Social media website via Reuters TV AMMAN | Mon Aug 8 , 2011 3:38 pm EDT AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad pressed on with a tank onslaught against a city Monday , but was plunged deeper into international isolation by Arab neighbors who denounced his violent crackdown and recalled their envoys from Damascus . Assad 's five-month campaign against street protests has emerged as one of the bloodiest episodes of the wave of democratic revolutions sweeping the Arab world this year . Killings have worsened sharply in the past week after Assad ordered tank assaults on two cities . Other Arab leaders had been cautious about criticizing one of their peers , but Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah broke the silence with a rare intervention overnight , demanding an end to the bloodshed and recalling the Saudi ambassador from Damascus . Hours later Kuwait and Bahrain recalled their envoys too . Syrian tanks and troops poured into the eastern Sunni city of Deir al-Zor in the latest stage of a campaign to crush centers of protest against 41 years of Assad family rule . `` Armored vehicles are shelling the al-Hawiqa district heavily with their guns . Private hospitals are closed and people are afraid to send the wounded to state facilities because they are infested with secret police , '' Mohammad , a Deir al-Zor resident who did not want to give his full name . He said at least 65 people had been killed since tanks and Armored vehicles barreled into the provincial capital , 400 km -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- northeast of Damascus , Sunday , crumpling makeshift barricades and opening fire . Later Monday Assad fired defense minister Ali Habib and replaced him with chief of staff General Daoud Rajha . The state news agency said Habib was ill . Habib had been added to an EU sanctions list last week for his role in crushing protests . Syria 's military is effectively under the command of Assad 's brother Maher . Many officers are from the Assad family 's minority Alawite sect . The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights said among those killed were a mother and her two children , an elderly woman and a young girl . Syria has expelled most independent media since the uprising began , making it hard to confirm accounts . The sudden withdrawal of ambassadors of Gulf Arab states leaves Assad with few diplomatic friends . Western states have imposed sanctions on top Syrian officials and countries with close ties to Damascus such as Russia and Turkey have warned Assad he is running out of time . Nevertheless , countries have not proposed military action like that ranged against Libya 's leader Muammar Gaddafi . Assad 's forces shot dead at least three mourners Monday when they opened fire at a funeral for a pro-democracy protester in the southern border city of Deraa , cradle of the five month uprising , witnesses and activists said . Rami Abdulrahman of the Syrian Observatory said one of the dead was Maen Yousef Awadat , a leading political campaigner , who had recently been released from prison . The funeral was for a youth arrested earlier this week when he took part street protests after nightly Ramadan prayers . His body was handed to relatives earlier Monday with signs of torture , according to relatives contacted in Deraa . The Saudi criticism was the sharpest the oil giant has directed against any fellow Arab state since uprisings began to sweep the region , toppling autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt , kindling civil war in Libya and rattling elites . `` What is happening in Syria is not acceptable for Saudi Arabia , '' the Saudi king said in a written statement read out on Al Arabiya satellite television . `` Syria should think wisely before it 's too late and issue and enact reforms that are not merely promises but actual reforms . '' `` Either it chooses wisdom on its own or it will be pulled down into the depths of turmoil and loss . '' The assault on Deir al-Zor , in an oil-producing province bordering Iraq , took place a week after tanks stormed the city of Hama , where residents say scores have been killed . The official SANA news agency said Monday the military was winding down in Hama . Residents said there were still tanks in parts of the city and security forces were making arrests . The Observatory said 1,500 people had been arrested in Hama 's Jarajima neighborhood and troops killed three civilians . Like most of Syria , Hama and Deir al-Zor are mainly-Sunni cities , and the crackdowns there resonate with Sunnis , who form the majority in the region and rule most Arab countries . The Arab League called for an end to the bloodshed . France and Germany repeated calls for Assad to scrap the military campaign which rights groups say has killed at least 1,600 civilians . Saudi Arabia 's decision to join countries putting pressure on Assad was unlikely to deter the 45-year old president , who calls the clampdown a national duty , regional experts said . Relations between Sunni Saudi Arabia and a Syrian ruling elite from Assad 's minority Alawite sect have been tense since the assassination in 2005 of Rafik al-Hariri , a Western-backed Lebanese Sunni statesman who also had Saudi nationality . In Cairo , the head of the most influential school of Sunni Islam , al-Azhar , described the violence as a human tragedy that had to stop . `` Blood only fuels the fires of revolutions , '' said Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb . Hama is known throughout the region as the site of a crackdown by Assad 's father nearly 30 years ago against Sunni Islamists in which many thousands died . Syrian authorities denied that any Deir al-Zor assault had taken place . The official state news agency said `` not a single tank has entered Deir al-Zor '' and reports of tanks in the city were `` the work of provocateur satellite channels . '' Syrian authorities say they have faced attacks since the protests erupted in March , blaming armed saboteurs for civilian deaths and accusing them of killing 500 security personnel . State television broadcast footage Sunday of mutilated bodies floating in the Orontes river in Hama , saying 17 police had been ambushed and killed in the central Syrian city . Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who cultivated close ties with Assad but has sharply criticised the crackdown , said Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu would visit Syria Tuesday . `` Our message will be decisively delivered , '' he said , drawing a rebuke from an Assad adviser , who described the Turkish statement as unbalanced . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke to Davutoglu Sunday , the State Department said , asking him to `` reinforce '' Washington 's position that Syria must immediately return its military to barracks and release prisoners .

Gold prices rose above those of platinum for the first time since December 2008 late on Monday . The last time this happened , the situation reversed within a few days , and traders said then that the convergence of the gold-platinum ratio gave a clear signal to sell gold and buy platinum . Today 's backdrop is very different . `` Gold as a defensive asset is being driven higher at the moment by risk aversion , and platinum as a cyclical asset is under pressure because growth is slowing , '' said Michael Widmer , an analyst at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch . `` We were there around the great recession -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , and then you had the various stimulus packages hitting the market , and you saw the prices of the two metals starting to diverge again , '' he said . `` The macro picture is a bit different this time around . I do n't think that it is a compelling trade . '' In contrast to the situation in 2008 , gold 's premium to platinum is a function of its own strength , rather than a falling platinum price . Gold hit a record $ 1,778.29 an ounce this week as concerns over economic stability and debt crises in the euro zone and United States sparked heavy buying among investors . Platinum prices have eased by just over 2 percent this year , although they have not dropped in the same way as some industrial metals such as copper , which is down 8.2 percent in electronic trading , or zinc down 13.2 percent . Although platinum is nominally a precious metal , the bulk of its demand comes from the industrial sector , particularly carmakers who use it to make catalytic converters . This makes it more sensitive to threats to growth . This may mean it still has some way to fall , potentially further widening its discount to gold , analysts said . In 2008 , platinum plummeted from record highs to fall below the price of gold , said Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Lewis . `` Now ... this parity has occurred and we have n't priced in that recession risk yet , '' he said . `` There is more risk that if we get negative data , it could sustain that discount of platinum for a longer period of time . '' A short-term reversal in the ratio is possible . The current rush for safety sparked by Standard & Poor 's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating on Friday has sparked a 6.3 percent rally in gold prices in the past two days alone , their biggest two-day rise since 2008 . That kind of jump has typically been followed by a correction , as was seen in late April after gold 's initial break above $ 1,500 an ounce . At the same time , there are some factors that could suggest a short-term rise in platinum prices as the threat of strike action among miners in South Africa , the source of four out of five ounces of the world 's platinum supply , continues to loom . But any possible reversal in the fortunes of gold and platinum are likely to be brief , with the wider economic picture still overwhelmingly pointing to continued appetite for so-called havens at the expense of assets seen as higher risk . `` If you look at the platinum group metals and other industrial metals as well as oil , it is all a one-way street -- down , '' said Afshin Nabavi , head of trading at MKS Finance . `` Gold and the Swiss franc are really the only safe havens . '' In the longer term , gold prices will undoubtedly correct at some point , with a rise in U.S. interest rates expected to be the turning point in the yellow metal 's decade-long rally . Meanwhile , platinum 's underlying supply fundamentals still point to higher prices as South Africa 's mining sector faces stronger cost pressures from an increased focus on safety , rising inflation and higher wage demands . This should give long-term support to the metal . But in the current environment , few are looking that far out . `` On a historical basis , the ratio looks cheap , but that is not necessarily reason to buy , '' UBS analyst Edel Tully said in a research note . `` If we were prepared to buy the ratio now and hold it for a year or two , it would probably be a good trade , given that platinum 's fundamentals signal a lot more tightness over the medium term . But as investors struggle to make money in the short term , positioning for the medium term is in short supply .

Syria `` will not relent in pursuing the terrorist groups in order to protect the stability of the country and the security of the citizens , '' state news agency SANA quoted Assad as telling Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu . `` But -LRB- Syria -RRB- is also determined to continue reforms ... and is open to any help offered by friendly and brotherly states . '' While the two men held talks in Damascus , Syrian forces killed at least 30 people and moved into a town near the Turkish border , an activist group said . The National Organization for Human Rights said most of the fatalities occurred when troops backed by tanks and armored vehicles overran villages north of Hama , while four were killed in Binnish , 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- from the border with Turkey . Washington expressed disappointment at Assad 's latest comments and said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expected to talk to Davutoglu after his meetings in Syria . `` It is deeply regrettable that President Assad does not seem to be hearing the increasingly loud voice of the international community , '' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters when asked about the comment . She refused to comment directly on a 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable quoted by McClatchy newspapers last week describing Assad in unflattering terms , calling him `` neither as shrewd nor as long-winded as his father '' -LRB- former president Hafez al-Assad -RRB- . Despite the growing international condemnation , including a sudden wave of Arab criticism , Assad 's forces pursued an offensive in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor , residents said . Activists say at least 1,600 civilians have died since the uprising against Assad erupted in March , making it one of the bloodiest of the upheavals sweeping the Arab world . Davutoglu held six hours of meetings with Syrian officials , including a two-hour session alone with Assad . He told reporters on his return to Ankara that Turkey had demanded Damascus stop killing civilians and said his government would maintain contacts with all parts of Syrian society . Davutoglu said Turkey hoped for a peaceful transition in Syria resulting in the Syrian people deciding their own future . Neighboring Turkey has grown increasingly critical of the violence but earned a sharp rebuke on Sunday when an Assad adviser said Syria would not accept interference in its affairs . Syria has faced nearly five months of protests against Assad 's 11-year rule , inspired by Arab revolts which overthrew leaders in Egypt and Tunisia earlier this year . Last week Assad sent troops and tanks to quell the mostly Sunni Muslim city of Hama in central Syria and the army launched a similar assault on Sunday against Deir al-Zor . An armored column also pushed toward the center of the city on Tuesday , with troops storming houses and making arrests in the provincial capital of an oil region bordering Iraq 's Sunni heartland , a resident said . `` They are now about one kilometer from downtown . When they finish with one district , they move to another , '' said the resident , who gave his name as Iyad . Increasing the pressure on Assad , Sunni Muslim power Saudi Arabia issued a blunt warning that he risked turmoil unless he stopped the bloodshed and adopted reforms . Kuwait and Bahrain followed the kingdom in recalling their ambassadors . The withdrawal of envoys left Assad with few diplomatic friends bar Iran . Western states have imposed sanctions on his top officials , while states with close ties to Damascus such as Russia and Turkey have warned Assad he is running out of time . Nevertheless , no country has proposed military action such as that launched against Libya 's leader Muammar Gaddafi . In Deir al-Zor , a resident said on Monday 65 people had been killed since tanks and armored vehicles barreled into the city , 400 km -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- northeast of Damascus on Sunday . The British-based Syrian Observatory of Human Rights said among the dead were a mother and her two children , an elderly woman and a girl .

The official SANA news agency said on Monday the military was starting to pull out of Hama after it said they had helped restore order . Residents said there were still tanks in parts of the city and security forces were making arrests . About 1,500 people were detained in Hama 's Jarajima district and troops killed three civilians , the Observatory said . Activists say at least 130 people were killed in Hama , where Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist uprising in 1982 , and one group has put the death toll at over 300 . Like most of Syria , ruled by Assad 's minority Alawite family , Hama and Deir al-Zor are mainly Sunni cities , and the crackdowns there resonate with Sunnis , who form the majority in the region and govern most Arab countries . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Ail habeeb opposed the massacres committed by the syrian regime in Hama and other syrian cities . I believe in those citizens of Syria who call for reforms of the society so that it may become more democratic and open . What I believe the government of Syria owes to its people is the protection of the state against those parties that would disrupt civil society . The radical Sunni parties that are opportunist and have tainted the freedom movement in hopes of establishing an Islamic-law government , where non-Muslims are unwelcome . This hearkens back to the bleaker periods of Syria , when `` non-believers '' where discriminated against , driven from their land and often times slaughtered . For so-called `` democratic '' governments , the US and EU seem very willing to allow the Middle East to revert to the dark ages . There democratic principles appear to be non-existent when it comes to freedom for the people of the Middle East . They seem very willing to allow these people to be placed under the iron hand of Salafists . It appears to me that the West are the mercenaries of the extremist Wahhabis and will do their bidding in exchange for reasonable oil prices\\/production and trade . Principles are subverted by economic interests . What legitimate reason was there for the West to interfere in Libya ? I find it very ironic , hypocritical and laughable that King Abdullah is condemning the Syrians for the violence on their own people when if it was not for the financial subsidies it grants to its citizens , it would find itself in the same boat . The US and EU were comparatively silent when uprisings in Bahrain and Yemen so the governments go against their people . We saw Saudi Arabia send troops into Bahrain to help it put down a similar demonstration for freedom . There were nothing more than a few innocuous passing comments from the West . The whole situation appears to have become rather sectarian to me and the West is siding with those radical elements who are most dedicated to its demise -LRB- but should the West expect any less given its meddling and biased policies in the region . I am under no illusions regarding the brutality of the Syrian army in repressing these extremists . Neither am I naive , nor should the world be , that all the anti-government Syrians are peaceful protesters . The Saudis -LRB- the ultimate Salafists -RRB- are most likely funding a large part of the violent anti-government protesters . They are funding the arms being sent to those radical elements in Syria through Jordan , Iraq and Turkey . The West should be called upon to be proponents of ethical treatment of all people not just those who are buttering their bread . The ONLY solution for syria is widespread Turkish military offense against the brutal regimen of Bashar alasad . This will prevent horrible upcoming civil war in Syria and chaos that may spread to surrounding countires . Syria was part of Turkey for more than 400 years before it had its independence , which obviously was a big mistake . This discussion is now closed .

It 's clear that armed confrontation is the only option until the crisis is resolved . '' Bloody street fighting rocked Hasaba , home to Sadeq al-Ahmar , a tribal foe of Saleh , in May after the president reneged again on a Gulf-brokered plan to end his 33 years in power . The mortar and machinegun clashes subsided after a bomb blast wounded Saleh in his presidential compound , forcing him to seek treatment in Saudi Arabia , where he is recuperating . Now , with troops again manning checkpoints around the capital , the crackle of shooting in the crumbling alleyways of Hasaba -- and outbreaks of fighting elsewhere in a country awash with guns -- have reignited fears of civil war . For seven months , tens of thousands of Yemenis , including those in a protest camp not far from Hasaba , have demonstrated against Saleh . But shootouts between government forces and anti-Saleh gunmen are increasingly marring the peaceful protests . Yemen , the Arab world 's poorest state and host to an ambitious al Qaeda branch , borders oil giant Saudi Arabia . Gulf and Western powers fear it could collapse into a failed state on the doorstep of some of the world 's largest oil reserves . Fighting is on the rise in at least five parts of this rugged , mountainous country on the southern rim of the Arabian Peninsula . More and more armed men roam the streets of Yemeni cities as suspicions and frustrations multiply . The United States and Saudi Arabia , wary of turmoil that could give al Qaeda more room to operate , have been pressing Saleh for months to accept a transition plan brokered by Yemen 's wealthier neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council . Saleh has vowed to return to Yemen , even as U.S. officials urge him to stay away , deepening a political stalemate . Many Yemenis worry that it is too late to stave off a descent into bloodshed that would only compound their misery . `` I think the political solution has been eroded in favor of fighting . But even the fighting will not end the battle , '' said Yemeni analyst Ali Seif Hassan , citing the standoff in Sanaa between government forces and military units commanded Ali Mohsen , a powerful general who has defected to the opposition . `` When Yemen 's capital becomes divided like this , it means Yemen will be broken into more than one entity , '' he said . A similar confrontation between pro-Saleh forces and opposition tribesmen has turned Taiz , 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- south of Sanaa , into another tense and divided city . Fighting has already forced tens of thousands of Yemenis to flee their homes . Some are from villages shelled during battles between the army and opposition tribesmen . Thousands more have escaped from southern towns engulfed in clashes between troops and suspected al Qaeda militants and other Islamist fighters . Hasaba residents are bracing for the worst . Many have piled sandbags outside their already shell-pocked homes . At the nearby protest camp , some still believe in peaceful change but fear that violence could eclipse their struggle . `` We still hope to achieve our demands peacefully , but if we ca n't , it raises the threat of war , '' said leftist activist Samia al-Aghbari , sitting outside the rows of protest tents , her frowning face framed by a bright pink veil . Desperation is gripping many Yemenis as fuel shortages and soaring prices overwhelm a country where a third of the people suffer chronic hunger and nearly half live on $ 2 a day or less . Some residents , frustrated by their own politicians , are also turning their anger on foreign powers they feel have not put enough pressure on the government to reach a solution . `` If Saudi Arabia or America wanted Saleh to go they would have done it , '' complained Sanaa shopkeeper Yahya Musallah . `` The situation could be finished in less than a month . But they keep waiting and the war will come before they intervene .

LONDON | Fri Aug 12 , 2011 3:55 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - If history is any guide , another oil-induced recession may be just around the corner , at least for the United States and some of the other developed economies . Every time that the cost of oil relative to global economic output has hit current levels -- and that 's even after sharp falls in spot prices this month -- it has heralded a slump . And while economists and analysts say a serious slowdown can still be avoided , many add that unless oil and energy prices fall much further and -- most important -- stay down , the world economy could be in serious trouble . `` We are in a danger area for the world economy , '' said Christophe Barret , global oil analyst at Credit Agricole . The warning signal flashing is what economists call the `` oil expense indicator '' : the share of oil expenses as a proportion of worldwide gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- -LRB- oil prices times oil consumption divided by world GDP -RRB- . Since 1965 , this has averaged roughly 3 percent of GDP , and it has only exceeded 4.5 percent during three periods : in 1974 , between 1979 and 1985 and in 2008 . Each period has seen severe global recessions . In 1973\\/74 , during the first global `` oil shock , '' oil prices rocketed after an Arab oil embargo in response to an Arab-Israeli war disrupted oil flows and triggered panic buying . In 1979 , revolution in Iran knocked out much of the country 's oil output and was followed by a long Iran-Iraq war , bringing a second `` oil shock . '' In 2008 , propelled by a housing bubble , speculative buying of new debt instruments and a commodities boom , oil prices exceeded $ 100 per barrel for the first time and soared to a record high above $ 147 , helping trigger financial crisis and the worst slump since World War II . This time , oil prices have soared following the loss of around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libyan oil , uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa and rapid economic growth in China , India and other developing economies . Using the oil expense indicator , economists say Brent crude , the international oil benchmark , would need to be in the low $ 90s per barrel to be under the 4.5 percent danger mark . In fact , Brent hit a two-and-a-half-year high of more than $ 127 per barrel in April and , with the exception of an intra-day dip Tuesday , has been over $ 100 for six months . Even after a fall of more than $ 20 from its early-August high on worries over a slowdown in the developed economies , Brent is still not far off $ 110 per barrel . Oil is a key global cost because it is crucial to every part of the economy , powering manufacturing and the production of food and other commodities , fuelling transport as well as being a building block for industries such as plastics and electronics . If it is too high for too long , the results are dramatic . `` The last two times that energy as a share of global GDP neared ... the current level , the world economy experienced severe crises : the double dip recession of the 1980s and the Great Recession of 2008 , '' Merrill Lynch analysts led by Francisco Blanch said in a note to clients . Economists reinforce their warnings over the possibility of an impending slowdown with data showing that oil demand has begun to shrink in some countries in response to high prices . Oil data lags , but the latest U.S. figures , for May , show a drop of 4.7 percent year-on-year in U.S. gasoline demand . Deutsche Bank analyst Adam Sieminski says he is concerned by a trend towards lower U.S. oil demand evident since last summer : `` The last time U.S. oil demand was falling was in 2007 and early 2008 , '' Sieminski said in a note written with analyst Michael Lewis . `` This was a leading indicator of the economic troubles that would hit the U.S. in the middle of 2008 . '' Analysts differ on exactly how high oil prices need to be and how long they need to stay up before they slow growth . Some economists argue the impact of oil prices has been exaggerated , and others note that not all recessions are caused by oil , such as slowdowns in the early 1990s and again a decade later . But most economists argue there is a level at which fuel input costs become incompatible with continuing economic growth . James Zhang , an analyst at Standard Bank , says the danger level comes with the oil expense indicator at around 5 percent : `` $ 100 per barrel represents about 5 percent for the ` oil expense indicator ' , which we think would be a threshold on an annual average level to potentially kill off global growth , '' he said . `` Absent any shocks , I do n't believe an oil price , say in the range of $ 100 to $ 130 , will necessary bring a recession itself , but a slower growth is almost ensured -- another sharp jump in oil prices could act as a shock , '' Zhang said . Barret said record high oil and commodity prices were putting unsustainable pressure on household expenditure , and while he like other economists is reluctant to predict recession , he thinks the warnings should be heeded : `` There is still a chance that oil prices will go down very significantly , and that could be a strong support to the economy . But if prices stay near $ 110 per barrel until the end of the year , we will have a major problem by the start of 2012 , '' he said . `` We either get sharply lower prices or a recession that will bring down prices . Either way , oil prices must come down .

Everyone is pointing fingers -- at blundering politicians , hooded thugs , disaffected youths , bumbling police and greedy bankers -- but could the cause for all the madness really be the star at the center of our solar system ? There is n't a lot of evidence pointing to little green men involving themselves in Earthly affairs , but the sun has been throwing bursts of highly charged particles into space in a phenomenon known as coronal mass ejections or CMEs . Three large CMEs prompted U.S. government scientists to warn of solar storms that can cause power blackouts and the aurora borealis , or northern lights , caused by disturbances in the Earth 's atmosphere , have been spotted as far south as England and Colorado , NASA said . `` Earth 's magnetic field is still reverberating from a CME strike on August 5th that sparked one of the strongest geomagnetic storms in years '' , website SpaceWeather said . Some academics have claimed that such geomagnetic storms can affect humans , altering moods and leading people into negative behavior through effects on their biochemistry . Some studies have found evidence that hospital admissions for depression rise during geomagnetic storms and that incidents of suicide increase . A 2003 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that such storms could affect the stock market , as traders were more likely to make pessimistic choices . `` Unusually high levels of geomagnetic activity have a negative , statistically and economically significant effect on the following week 's stock returns for all US stock market indices , '' the authors found in their report . It could of course be mere coincidence that this has been a rollercoaster week on the markets , and that Britain was rocked by a wave of ferocious rioting and looting . But market watchers may take comfort from the fact that the space weather forecast for Friday has gone quiet again . They should n't be too complacent though . The solar cycle is on an upswing due to peak in 2013 and there are likely to be more geomagnetic storms heading Earth 's way in the months to come . -LRB- Editing by Paul Casciato -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "119", "dct": "2011-08-14", "dates": ["2011-08-14", "2011-08-14", "2011-08-01", "2011-08-14", "2011-08-14"], "text": "ROUGH CUT -LRB- NO REPORTER NARRATION -RRB- REUTERS CAN NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE CONTENTS OF THIS VIDEO The Syrian navy shelled the main Mediterranean port city of Latakia on Sunday -LRB- August 14 -RRB- , residents said , as President Bashar al-Assad broadened a military offensive to crush street protests against his rule .

In a country that knows a thing or two about diplomatic isolation , Iran 's politicians and media describe the Damascus government as an outpost of resistance to Israel that has been set upon by Washington and its lackeys in the region . While several Gulf Arab countries have withdrawn their ambassadors in protest at the violence , and countries once close to Damascus , Russia and Turkey , have turned harshly critical , Iran is the only big country still backing Syria , arguing anything else would spell disaster . `` In regard to Syria we are confronted with two choices . The first is for us to place Syria in the mouth of a wolf named America and change conditions in a way that NATO would attack Syria , '' said Alaeddin Boroujerdi , head of the Iranian parliament 's foreign affairs committee . `` That would mean we would have a tragedy added to our other tragedies in the world of Islam . '' `` The second choice would be for us to contribute to the termination of the clashes in Syria , '' Boroujerdi said . `` The interests of the Muslim people command that we mobilize ourselves to support Syria as a center of Palestinian resistance . '' A senior cleric pressed the message home . `` It is the duty of all Muslims to help stabilize Syria against the destructive plots of America and Israel , '' said Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi . Iran also used troops to put down mass protests following the disputed 2009 presidential election . Iranian leaders also described those demonstrations as a Western plot . Iran had hoped the Arab Spring , something Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dubbed the `` Islamic Awakening , '' would spell the end of U.S.-backed autocracies and usher in an era of Muslim unity to face-down the West and Israel . Khamenei used the June anniversary of the death of Iran 's revolutionary leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , to tell the nation : `` Our stance is clear : wherever a movement is Islamic , popular and anti-American , we support it . '' Without mentioning Syria by name , he continued : `` If somewhere a movement is provoked by America and Zionists , we will not support it . Wherever America and the Zionists enter the scene to topple a regime and occupy a country , we are on the opposite side . '' Mohammad Marandi , an associate professor at the University of Tehran , said Iran 's support for Syria was based on a shared interest in helping resistance to Israel -- both countries support Hamas and Hezbollah -- and that continuing to back Assad while he reforms Syria 's one-party system was imperative . `` Iran has always believed that Syria should not be weakened , because the Israeli regime will certainly take advantage of any weakness , '' Marandi told Reuters . `` In any case , real reforms can only be carried out in a peaceful environment . The Western and pro-Western Arab media campaign against Syria is intended to destabilize the country and to prevent Syria from implementing reforms that will keep Syria strong and an anti-Israeli government in power . '' He played down media reports of Iran increasing aid to Syria . `` I have not heard of any extraordinary aid delivery , except in the Western media or media outlets owned by despotic Arab regimes . '' While civil unrest in Syria has not gone unreported in Iran , it has received far less attention than uprisings in other parts of the region , particularly Bahrain where Saudi Arabia helped a Sunni monarchy put down protests led by majority Shi'ites . In recent days , as Western media , though banned from working in Syria , have reported a growing death toll , Iranian television has focused more attention on unrest in Britain that some Iranian journalists have described as a `` civil war . '' With Gulf Arab countries turning against Assad , and Turkey , a bridge between the Middle East and the West , taking a tougher stance , Iranian newspapers reflect Tehran 's growing isolation . After distancing his country from Israel and moving closer to the Muslim world since coming to power in 2003 , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan surprised some in Iran with his volte face . `` In Syria , the state is pointing guns at its own people ... Turkey 's message to Assad is very clear : stop all kinds of violence and bloodshed . '' The hardline Qods daily said Turkey , instead of showing support for Syria and Iran , had capitulated to U.S. pressure . `` If Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's government does not change its political behavior toward Syria , Turkey will be the main loser of the Syrian events if Damascus gets out of the current crisis , '' it wrote in a recent editorial . The papers reserved their harshest words for Iran 's Gulf Arab neighbors , particularly Saudi Arabia , whose relations with the mostly non-Arab Iran have become increasingly strained in recent months . `` Stabbing each other 's backs has now become a custom among Arab countries , like the way they previously betrayed Palestine , Libya , Iraq and Sudan . The current betrayal of Syria should come as no surprise , '' Siyasat-e Ruz daily said in an editorial . `` They are still under this illusion that convergence with America can help them preserve their establishment and restore their lost status in the region , '' the conservative paper said . They have turned into puppets for the goals of the West . '' Reformist daily Arman said Saudi Arabia and Bahrain appeared to be drawing the battle lines for a future regional conflict . `` They want to psychologically prepare the atmosphere so that if there is a conflict with Syria and Iran supports it they are standing on the opposite side and against Iran , '' Arman said . `` All the countries that want to settle a score with Iran would be happy if Iran entered such a conflict and then , in the name of the international community , they would harm Iran . '' The paper noted the urgent need for Assad to make good on his promised political reforms but with a death toll there which it put at 2,000 , `` it seems late for Bashar al-Assad to get out of this critical situation . '' The reformist daily concluded that it might soon be time for Tehran to rethink its staunch support for Assad . `` If the Syria situation continues then it 's time for Iran to think about its long term interests , '' it concluded , saying unconditional support for Assad might leave Iran supporting a government `` that has been thrown out of power ... That can have no benefits for itself or Iran . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The last will be Iran most likely . The propaganda machine is whipped up to get us to hate and fear Iran . But who should we really fear . That little weak country or the power who is producing the war propaganda ... . where to start with this one . How about with UN conspiracy , for an organization that hasnt done anything productive in decades , I doubt they could form any sort of conspiracy . Now for the IMF loans and the US , the IMF is a european based group , so no your answer is still stupid . No as for the `` independent countries '' , they were largely brought down because the government was independent from the people who should have been able to select it . Oddly enough you probably do n't have a democracy in a country that goes 4 decades without a regime change . What we should really be afraid of is at the ballot box ur opinion is worth as much as a well thought out one . So , what I take away from this article is that Iran considers Syrians to be sheep . This is not the case . It is interesting to see Iran change their opinion of an `` ally '' at the worst possible time . Iran is always working for the benefit of Iran . We are always working for the benefit of our country . All countries do the same thing . I would like to see the benefit for the United States in Iraq or Afganistan , but can not .

The Syrian Revolution Coordinating Union , a grassroots activists ' group , said three people , including Ahmad Soufi , 22 , were killed in Latakia Monday , bringing the civilian death toll there to 31 , including a two-year-old girl . Assad , from Syria 's minority Alawite sect , has broadened a military assault against towns and cities where demonstrators have been demanding his removal since the middle of March . The crackdown coincided with the August 1 start of the Muslim Ramadan fast , when nightly prayers became the occasion for more protests against 41 years of harsh Baathist party rule . Syrian forces have already stormed Hama , scene of a 1982 massacre by the military , the eastern city of Deir al-Zor , and several northwestern towns in a province bordering Turkey . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told Assad to halt such military operations now or face unspecified consequences . `` This is our final word to the Syrian authorities , our first expectation is that these operations stop immediately and unconditionally , '' Davutoglu said in Turkey 's strongest warning yet to its once close ally and neighbor . `` If these operations do not stop , there will be nothing left to say about the steps that would be taken , '' he told a news conference in Ankara , without elaborating . Turkish leaders , who have repeatedly urged Assad to end violence and pursue reforms , have grown frustrated . Davutoglu held talks with the Syrian leader in Damascus only last week . In a now-familiar pattern , tanks and armored vehicles deployed around dissident neighborhoods of Latakia and essential services were cut before security forces began raids , arrests and bombardment , residents said . `` Shelling has renewed on al-Raml al-Filistini -LRB- home to Palestinian refugees -RRB- and al-Shaab districts .

The best they can do is to move from one area to another within the city , '' another witness said . Thousands of people fled a Palestinian refugee camp in Latakia , some fleeing gunfire and others leaving on orders from the Syrian authorities , a U.N. official said . `` Between 5,000 and 10,000 have fled , we do n't where these people are so it 's very worrying , '' said Christopher Gunness , spokesman for the UNRWA agency which cares for Palestinian refugees . `` We have a handful of confirmed deaths and nearly 20 injured . '' The Palestinian presidency in the West Bank city of Ramallah urged Damascus to safeguard the lives of Palestinian refugees in al-Raml camp in Latakia . A grassroots activist group , the Local Coordination Committees , said it had the names of at least 260 civilians , including 14 women and two infants , killed this month . It said the actual toll was likely to be far higher with scant information so far from the hard-hit city of Hama , still besieged by troops and secret police . Syria has expelled most independent media since the unrest began , making it hard to verify reports from the country . Tanks and navy ships shelled southern parts of Latakia on Sunday , residents and rights groups said . Nightly anti-Assad rallies after Ramadan prayers have drawn around 20,000 people in different areas of the city , said one witness , a university student . The official state news agency SANA denied Latakia had been shelled from the sea and said two police and four unidentified armed men were killed when security forces pursued `` armed men who were terrorizing residents ... and using machineguns and explosives from rooftops and from behind barricades . '' The U.S. State Department said Monday it was unable to confirm that the Syrian navy had shelled Latakia . `` However , we are able to confirm that there is armor in the city and that there is firing on innocents again in the pattern of carnage that you have seen in other places , '' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland . Unlike most Syrian cities , which are mainly Sunni , Latakia has a large Alawite population , partly because Assad and his father before him encouraged Alawites to move from their nearby mountain region by offering them cheap land and jobs in the public sector and security apparatus . Latakia port has played a key role in the Assad family 's domination of the economy , with Bashar al-Assad 's late uncle Jamil having been in virtual control of the facility , and a new generation of family members and their friends taking over . Rights campaigners said security forces also assaulted villages in the Houla Plain north of the city of Homs Monday , raiding houses and arresting people . Assad replaced the governor of the northern province of Aleppo , SANA reported , after pro-democracy protests spread to the provincial capital , Syria 's main commercial hub . `` The minority regime is playing with fire . We are coming to a point where the people in the street would rather take any weapon they can put their hand on and fight than be shot at or arrested and humiliated , '' said one activist . `` We are seeing civil war in Syria , but it is one-sided . The hope is for street protests and international pressure to bring down the regime before it kills more Syrians and drives them to take up arms , '' he added , asking not to be named . Rights groups say at least 12,000 have been detained during the uprising . Thousands of political prisoners were already in jail . Amnesty International says it has listed 1,700 civilians killed since mid-March . Washington has put the toll at 2,000 . Damascus says 500 police and soldiers have been killed . The assaults by Syrian security forces have drawn increasing condemnation from the West , Turkey and more recently from Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan . Washington wants Europe and China to consider sanctions on Syria 's vital oil and gas industry . Germany called for more European Union sanctions against Syria Monday and urged the U.N. Security Council to discuss the crackdown again this week . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

WITNEY , England | Tue Aug 16 , 2011 12:10 am BST WITNEY , England -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday promised a law and order `` fightback '' and robust action to mend what he called Britain 's broken society after riots and looting last week shocked Britons and tarnished its reputation abroad . But he faced renewed questions over how far his plans to cut government spending may further alienate the young and the poor . In a speech full of tough language likely to please his traditional Conservative supporters , Cameron vowed more `` no-nonsense policing '' and tougher sentencing to tackle gang culture and known troublemakers , and said he would to do more to promote families , boost discipline in schools and encourage hard work . In north London , where riots began nine days ago , many welcomed his hard line -- but young people ushered in to hear his speech in rural Oxfordshire doubted it would do much to close a growing gap between rich and poor , or heal troubled communities facing his government 's deep public spending cuts . `` We have been too unwilling for too long to talk about what is right and wrong , '' Cameron said in a speech at a youth center in his mostly affluent constituency of Witney , near Oxford . More than 2,800 people have been arrested since a protest over a fatal shooting by police on August 4 prompted rioting and looting in the poor London district of Tottenham . That spread across the capital and sparked violence in other English cities . Cameron , who returned from holiday abroad last week after days of unrest , is seeking to tap into widespread public anger over the violence . They came 15 months after he took office at the head of a centre-right coalition committed to cuts in welfare and other spending that critics say will hit the poor . `` I think he 's right , '' Nicola Pastore , 26 , told Reuters as she pushed a pram in Tottenham . `` I do n't think the police have enough control . My kids are scared to go to sleep at night . '' Cameron , who faces criticism for plans to cut spending on police and for his management of the crisis , said the riots had been a `` wake-up call '' for Britain , whose reputation abroad was tarnished by the images of groups rampaging through its cities . Behind him as he spoke was a graffiti-style mural centred on characters in the kind of hoods and masks worn by many looters . The stakes are high for Cameron . Any repeat of last week 's lawlessness , in which shops were smashed and set on fire and five people died , will sap public confidence in his government . However , analysts say the 44-year-old premier , a former public relations executive from a wealthy establishment background , could benefit politically if he provides the tough law and order response some voters are seeking . Cameron has taken a hard line in rhetoric . His speech on Monday talked of the dangers of indiscipline in schools and family breakdown , succor to traditional Conservatives who feel their young leader has been too liberal on social issues . Cameron and his centre-left Liberal Democrat coalition partners will review their program over the coming weeks , looking at issues like welfare and substance addiction in an effort to promote more stable communities . But the prime minister has ruled out easing spending cuts which some critics on the left say are fuelling tensions in Britain 's cities , where the gap between rich and poor is gaping . Planned austerity has put Cameron on a collision course with the police , still smarting over his criticism of their initial response to the riots . Police chiefs say a 20 percent cut in their budget over the next four years will make it harder for them to maintain law and order . London 's Conservative mayor , Boris Johnson , has also said now is not the time for cuts to spending on police . But Cameron has refused to budge on plans to ease austerity measures , believing jittery financial markets will take fright at any sign of backtracking on plans to erase by 2015 a budget deficit that peaked at over 10 percent of national output . At Witney Ecumenical Youth Trust , where Cameron gave his speech , young people questioned how spending cuts squared with his plans to deal with social problems , and felt his speech created even more of a sense of ` them and us ' . Cameron was subjected to hostile whistling on arrival . After his televised speech , he took questions from journalists until a reporter chided him for not responding directly to young people in the audience . The prime minister later left to the sounds of hecklers clucking like chickens to accuse him of cowardice . `` He tried putting it across like everyone who 's had a broken family was wrong . It 's like he 's having a dig at us , '' said Jesse Day , 19 . She and her friends stressed the importance of community organizations like theirs -- a charity which relies on donations and which almost closed a few months ago . `` He says he wants people to get in touch with their families . But for some people , their families are n't there and the youth center 's the only people to talk to , '' said Ryan Clayton , 15 . `` But he 's shutting all the youth centres . '' Others in Witney welcomed Cameron 's emphasis on behavior . `` I agree entirely , '' said 74-year-old Colin Bayliss . `` Discipline 's gone out the window . The family identity has gone out the window . There 's more single parents around . More people need to take responsibility for their families and their children . '' Opposition Labor leader Ed Miliband said a lack of morality was not confined to a `` feral underclass '' but was also displayed by risk-taking bankers , legislators who fiddled their expenses and newspaper reporters who hacked telephones for stories -- all major topics of debate in Britain in the past couple of years . `` When we talk about the sick behavior of those without power , let 's also talk about the sick behavior of those with it , '' he said in a speech at his old school in London on Monday . It was a line echoed by Cameron . Leaders are conscious that voters , disillusioned by what many see as a failure to punish bankers they hold responsible for the financial crisis , could take unkindly to being lectured by politicians , the press and police , all institutions hit by scandal in the recent past .

The 50-minute French film `` The Female Orgasm Explained , '' which includes naked scenes , is carried on long-haul `` Video on Demand '' aircraft in the airline 's `` The Edge '' channel -- complete with a warning that it is for mature audiences only . `` In general programs are selected according to quality of content , box office\\/ratings , topicality and Qantas customer demographics , '' Qantas said in a statement , adding that programs were screened by their program team before licensing . `` With the Edge , we source programs that are out of the ordinary across all genres .

Russia , the world 's second largest arms exporter , wants to make up for $ 4 billion of contracts lost when the United Nations placed an arms embargo on Libya this year and is also looking to Africa , South America and Southeast Asia to compensate . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Russia last week to halt arms deliveries to Syria , one of the Russian defense industry 's best clients , following the crackdown on protests against President Bashar al-Assad . `` There were deliveries of arms to Syria last year , and there will be deliveries this year . They will continue , '' Anatoly Isaykin , general director of Russia 's top arms exporter Rosoboronexport , told a news conference at Russia 's premiere airshow outside Moscow . There has been no sign from the Kremlin that Russia is about to respond to Clinton 's appeal by halting arms deliveries to Damascus . Russia has repeatedly said sales in the region conform with international law and do not threaten regional security . Russia has carved out a niche selling arms to countries unwilling or unable to buy from the top arms exporter , the United States . Isaykin said Rosoboronexport would deliver on contracts it has signed with Syria , including a recent agreement for Russia 's Yak-130 light attack fighter plane . ROSOBORONEXPORT 'S SALES SET TO RISE He said he expected to make deliveries on at least $ 9 billion worth of arms globally in 2011 , higher than sales of around $ 8.6 billion last year . Rosoboronexport makes up 80-90 percent of the country 's arms exports every year . `` I 'm sure the volume -LRB- of arms supplies -RRB- will total at least $ 9 billion , '' he said . Russia 's arms sales have soared by more than 20 percent in the first half of 2011 to $ 5.9 billion as governments , fearing turmoil like that seen this year in North Africa and the Middle East , boost their arms stockpiles , Isaykin said . `` Naturally we are trying to compensate for the losses we saw due to the events of North Africa , '' Isyakin said . `` We are trying to work more actively on the African continent , in western-central Africa . Southeast Asia , is one of the places where we are trying to market more effectively as are the countries of South America . '' The Russian arms industry -- nurtured under Vladimir Putin 's 2000-2008 presidency -- has sold weapons to post-Soviet states and Cold War allies for decades on the strength of Soviet design and technology , which once rivaled that of the United States .

Turkish leaders , who once backed Assad , are sounding increasingly frustrated with the Syrian leader in the same way they became frustrated with Muammar Gaddafi after trying to mediate in the Libyan civil war . `` We have done our best on Libya , but have n't been able to generate any results . So it 's an international issue now . Gaddafi could not meet our expectations , and the outcome was obvious , '' Erdogan told reporters . `` Now the same situation is going on in Syria . I 've sent my foreign minister , and personally got in touch many times , the last of them three days ago on the phone . In spite of all this , civilians are still getting killed , '' he said . Erdogan repeatedly contacted Gaddafi after the Libyan uprising began in February , calling for a ceasefire and for Gaddafi to allow a transition of power . In June , Erdogan offered him an unspecified guarantee if he left Libya but received no answer . Since then Turkey has stepped up support for the Libyan rebels , increasing shipments of diesel to them . Syrian troops raided houses in a Sunni district of the besieged port of Latakia on Wednesday , residents said , arresting hundreds of people and taking them to a stadium after a four-day tank assault to crush protests against Assad . Rights organizations say at least 1,700 civilians have been killed by security forces since the protests erupted in March , while Syrian authorities say terrorist groups have killed 500 soldiers and police . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu also called again on Wednesday for Syria to end military operations but he has ruled out foreign intervention in Turkey 's southern neighbor . `` The bloodshed has to stop , first and foremost . The military operations have to stop , '' Davutoglu told a news conference with his Jordanian counterpart Nasser Judeh . `` If the operations continue in Syria and the operations become a regional problem Turkey can naturally not remain indifferent . '' Asked about a news report that Turkey might create a buffer zone along its border with Syria , Davutoglu said : `` We 're talking about a border that is 900 km long . We can not talk about such a development right now , '' he said . Turkish officials denied on Tuesday the report that Ankara was planning a buffer zone to prevent an influx of refugees . With Assad defying international pressure and Syrian refugees crossing over the border into Turkey , media have previously said that Turkish political and military leaders were considering setting up a buffer zone inside Syria . Relations between Syria and Turkey , its imperial ruler until World War One , have often been tense . The two countries almost went to war in the 1990s when Turkish forces were battling Kurdish rebels operating from bases inside Syria . -LRB- Reporting by Ibon Villelabeitia and Ece Toksabay ; writing by Daren Butler ; editing by David Stamp -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Austria , Finland and Ireland all questioned bold proposals from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to give up sovereignty over budgetary policies as a means to shore up their 17-nation currency union . Market analysts warned that political dissent coupled with failure to deliver any concrete pledges to increase the size of Europe 's euro rescue fund , or launch of euro bonds , risks a renewed attack on heavily indebted countries . `` There is little in the way of concrete measures in these decisions , '' said Wolfgang Leoni , chief investment officer at Sal . `` This is exactly what the markets do n't want . '' In a sign of investor jitters , flight from the euro currency resumed on Wednesday as money sought the relative safety of the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar . German debt , another safe haven , was also well bid compared with other euro-zone government debt . The region 's stock markets were mixed . The message left by Merkel and Sarkozy was that , in the short term , responsibility for warding off any new attacks on indebted euro-zone countries rests solely with the European Central Bank . But the central bank , which already has thrown tens of billions of euros into the bonds of countries such as Italy and Spain is internally divided over the wisdom of that move , creating further anxiety for investors . `` I think the crisis in fact is likely to get worse before it gets better despite the announcements that we had yesterday , '' Jacques Cailloux , chief European economist at RBS , told Reuters Insider television . `` The ECB is trapped here , '' Cailloux said , adding that he sees the ECB could end up buying almost $ 300 billion worth of Spanish and Italian bonds by late September to fight off waves of speculative attacks . The prospect of the ECB essentially bankrolling countries with budget deficit problems throws the central bank into the heart of European politics , territory way beyond its monetary mandate causing tensions within its governing council . ECB bond buying acts as a bridge until euro-zone parliaments have approved enhancements agreed last month to Europe 's rescue fund , which would allow it to start making bond purchases . That process passed an important hurdle late on Wednesday when the Dutch prime minister secured broad political support for the Greek bailout agreed last month by European leaders , a key test before an official vote due within a few weeks ' time . The Netherlands is a solid backer of the euro project but its coalition government could face problems with a disillusioned electorate . Another traditional German ally Austria on Wednesday criticised the Franco-German move towards `` economic governance . '' Ireland reacted sceptically to a pledge by Berlin and Paris to press ahead with a harmonisation of their corporate tax rates in hopes that other euro members would follow suit . A separate proposal to write German-style `` debt brake '' rules into national constitutions across the 17-nation currency bloc by mid-2012 faces big hurdles given Sarkozy himself is struggling to secure a parliamentary majority at home for such a plan . Finland 's finance minister questioned whether the rule would work at all and said she was `` not too excited '' about making changes to her country 's constitution . Some of the steps unveiled at the news conference in Paris on Tuesday would have seemed almost revolutionary as recently as a year ago . Merkel bowed to longstanding French calls to hold regular meetings of euro zone leaders and appoint a symbolic president , or spokesman , for the bloc -- steps that are bound to widen the divide between euro `` ins '' and `` outs '' in the 27-nation EU . But in the midst of a crippling crisis that has threatened to engulf big countries like Spain , Italy and France , the announcements were criticised by many as `` too little too late . '' Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields hovered near 5 percent , more than a percentage point below where they stood before the ECB first intervened in the markets earlier this month . Economists said markets could test the resolve of European policymakers again within weeks . `` Markets are looking for a magic bullet and that does n't exist , '' said Julian Callow , an economist at Barclays in London . `` Instead of a magic bullet we have more of the same . Governments are trying to cut their deficits , that is eating into demand and driving economies weaker . Both Spain and Italy held out hope that Merkel and Sarkozy would change their minds and embrace joint euro bonds . One worry is that the Franco-German proposals re-open a number of contentious debates within the EU , further sapping investor confidence . Merkel and Sarkozy vowed on Tuesday to press ahead with long-stalled plans for a financial transactions tax . But the UK has long opposed this , and moving ahead without the City of London could end up hurting the financial sectors in Frankfurt and Paris . Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he would insist that any such tax apply to all 27 members of the EU , not just the 17 that share the euro . Looming elections in key euro zone member states -- Spain votes in November and France in the spring -- could also complicate implementation of the proposals announced by Merkel and Sarkozy . France 's Socialists have strongly opposed the government 's plans to introduce a balanced budget rule to the constitution , threatening to turn it into a campaign issue . On Wednesday Francois Hollande , the leading Socialist candidate to challenge Sarkozy in next year 's vote , urged a national debate on the issue . -LRB- Reporting from European bureaus ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford and Andrew Hay -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Equities plunged , volatility jumped and gold hit a fresh record as traders said fears of a new recession were growing again , sparking another round of risk aversion reminiscent of the violent sell-offs at the start of this month . Brent crude fell as much as $ 4.10 a barrel to $ 106.50 at one stage , on course for the biggest percentage loss in 10 days . U.S. crude dropped almost 6 percent . Thursday 's declines follow a short-lived rebound that had seen Brent climb by around $ 9 in the previous six sessions . `` It 's much of the same -- concerns over European banks , U.S. deficits weighing on economic growth and the possibility of a global recession as the end result , '' said Chris Jarvis , senior analyst for Caprock Risk Management in Hampton Falls , `` These cross currents are driving wild swings for riskier asset classes such as equities and commodities , specifically crude oil . Until clarity improves , we expect volatility to remain elevated relative to historical norms . '' At 1.40 p.m. EDT -LRB- 1730 GMT -RRB- , Brent crude was down $ 3.95 at $ 106.65 a barrel , breaking below the 200-day moving average , a key technical indicator closely watched by traders . U.S. crude oil was down $ 5.40 , or 6 percent , at $ 83.18 a barrel . U.S. crude 's discount to Brent widened to about $ 24 a barrel . Early pressure from disappointing U.S. weekly jobless claims and July home sales reports sparked a steep sell-off mid-morning . Selling then intensified after a report showed factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region in August dropped to the lowest level since March 2009 . Implied volatility in the oil market soared , with the Chicago Board Options Exchange 's Oil Volatility Index hitting 54.23 percent , its highest level in more than a week and snapping a steady downtrend . `` The market is in meltdown mode ; the data continues to stink . I do n't know that there 's much more to be said . We continue to be in a soft patch , '' said Sal Catrini , managing director for equities at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in New York . The dollar rose and gold hit a new record of $ 1,825.99 an ounce as investors sought safe havens away from equities and industrial commodities . U.S. stocks tumbled 4 percent and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB , an index tracking 19 commodities , was down 2.4 percent in the steepest one-day loss since the U.S. credit downgrade earlier this month by Standard and Poor 's . Analysts have revised down forecasts for fuel consumption in recent weeks as concerns about global growth rose , with Morgan Stanley the latest bank to cut its forecast for global gross domestic product in 2011 and 2012 . Concerned the European debt crisis might spread to U.S. banks , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has asked for more information about whether the U.S. units of big European lenders have reliable access to funds needed to operate , the Wall Street Journal reported . Oil trading volumes rose back up toward the 30-day average after three days of relatively light trade at the start of this week . The oil market is also closely watching developments in North Africa and the Middle East . In Libya , where around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of crude production has been cut by a six-month civil war , rebel forces took control of a refinery and blocked a main highway , further isolating Muammar Gaddafi 's Tripoli stronghold . U.S. President Barack Obama banned U.S. imports of Syrian oil as part of sanctions against Amman , and joined the European Union in calling for President Bashar al-Assad to step down after a five-month crackdown on protesters . Brent prices are up by almost 13 percent so far in 2011 , in part because of the Libyan outage , but are almost $ 20 a barrel below the post-2008 peak they hit back in April as European refiners scrambled to find alternatives to Libyan supplies . `` What was announced today will have a very limited impact as it does n't really prevent anyone from outside the U.S. dealing with Syrian oil , '' said Greg Priddy , global oil analyst at Eurasia Group in Washington . `` With 95 percent of Syrian oil exports going to the EU , you might see more action there , '' he added . Syria produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day , exporting most of about 150,000 barrels per day to European countries including the Netherlands , Italy , France and Spain . About 10,000 barrels per day of Syrian oil products were exported to the United States in the first five months of 2011 , out of total imports of near 9 million bpd .

Analysts and traders said it would take several weeks before Syrian oil trade could grind to a halt , even if traders such as Vitol or Trafigura are forced to stop sending refined products for President Bashar Assad 's government and companies such as Shell are forced to stop producing and exporting oil from Syria . `` The bigger problem could be if it provokes a wider confrontation with Iran as Assad moves closer towards Tehran . I would never discount Iran at some point taking some kind of retaliatory action , '' said Paul Harris from Bank of Ireland . The United States on Thursday imposed fresh sanctions on Syria , freezing assets in the United States as well as banning Syrian-origin petroleum and petroleum products in response to weeks of Assad 's lethal crackdown on anti-government protesters . Syria 's oil production declined to 385,000 barrels per day in 2010 from 581,000 bpd in 2001 , or just a fraction of the 1.6 million bpd that OPEC-member Libya was producing earlier this year before its civil war shut down output . Syria exports over one third of its output to Europe , and companies such as Shell , Total , China 's CNPC and India 's ONGC are responsible for a large chunk of its production together with the state 's Syrian Petroleum Company . Shell and Total told Reuters on Thursday they always comply with relevant sanctions , legislation and laws but declined to comment on whether they are ready to stop producing oil in Syria or buying its oil . Shell produces around 55,000 bpd in Syria . A Vitol spokesman said the company was not commenting on individual transactions but added that if a contract has commenced and payment has been received , the delivery would go ahead . `` Trafigura is awaiting clarification of the situation following today 's announcements with respect to sanctions related to Syria . The company always operates in accordance with relevant national and international regulations , '' the trading house said in a statement . Analysts and traders said they would not lose sleep even if all Syrian supplies were lost . `` How big an issue is it with Syria when you have got Saudi Arabia acting as a potential backstop to any shortfalls ? '' said Michael Hewson from CMC Markets , referring to Riyadh 's decision to supply more oil from June to compensate for the loss of Libyan crude and moderate prices . Both Bank of Ireland 's Harris and David Kirsch , director of markets and country strategies at PFC Energy , said they would not rule out that Europe could also impose oil sanctions soon given the toughening of stance on Assad . `` Whether they are U.S.-based or not , oil firms are going to be very wary of crossing these sanctions , '' said Kirsch . Most U.S. companies have long stopped dealing with Syrian crude . U.S. firms such as ExxonMobil were also the first to walk away from Libyan oil dealings . For international banks , the sanctions on Libya also made it difficult to finance export transactions involving Libyan crude . In the case of Syria , the number of banks that are still providing export financing to firms dealing with Syrian oil has also shrunk grammatically in recent months , traders say . Assad has been condemned by many Arab neighbors and can count only on one firm ally - Iran , the world 's fourth-largest oil producer and itself subject to years of U.S. sanctions , although it still exports oil to Europe and Asia . `` The main sanctions -LRB- on Syria -RRB- that are starting to bite are really coming from Saudi Arabia , which has cut off support for Assad , '' Kirsch said . `` That 's going to push Assad closer to Iran for now -- they can provide him with the bullets he needs given how he 's chosen to deal with this rebellion , '' he added .

The United States for the first time explicitly called on Thursday for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down because of his brutal crackdown on five months of protests against his authoritarian rule . U.S. President Barack Obama also imposed a fresh round of sanctions on Syria 's government , freezing assets in the United States as well as banning petroleum products of Syrian origin . The Joint War Committee -LRB- JWC -RRB- , which groups syndicate members from the Lloyd 's Market Association -LRB- LMA -RRB- and representatives from London 's insurance company market , said while the situation in Syria was concerning it had not reached a level where it would be added to its list of high risk areas . `` At this time , current events would not justify such action because the threat to maritime assets is simply not high enough , '' said LMA senior technical executive Neil Roberts . `` It is a delicate business . The JWC does not want to be too slow , but at the same time will not act without objective evidence that the situation is serious for shipping and underwriters , '' he told Reuters . The London marine insurance market plays an influential role in the global marine insurance industry . Syria 's official news agency SANA said on Wednesday four oil tankers were loading and unloading this week as scheduled , adding that reports of operations being hindered at the ports of Tartous and Banias were `` untrue . '' `` Local security forces assisted by the army started to attack Latakia on Saturday forcing the port to close . Today the port reopened and is working normally , '' a shipping agent source based in Syria told Reuters on Thursday . `` Tartous remains open and working normally . '' Some European oil traders are still supplying fuel to Damascus , and several international oil companies have significant interests in the country . `` This latest political signal from the United States will likely prompt a strategic re-assessment in the boardrooms of several firms , '' said John Drake , senior risk consultant with security firm AKE . `` Employees will become less willing to travel to the country to work , and companies may have to re-assess their reputational risks of doing business with the regime . J. Peter Pham , with the Atlantic Council think tank , said banks , insurers , and other firms could be at risk of breaching U.S. law irrespective of their location . `` This legal threat increases exponentially the risk of doing any business with Syria and , over time , could well choke off a great deal of commerce as businesses , including shippers , are adverse to any risk in today 's fragile economy , '' Pham said . Syrian forces have fired on peaceful protesters throughout the country , often at short range and without warning , killing at least 1,900 civilians , including children , U.N. investigators said on Thursday . Syria 's net oil exports were less than 117,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- in 2009 , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . The impact of any Syrian energy disruption on global supplies would be much smaller than the loss of over 1.3 million bpd of oil and 956 million cubic feet a day of gas exported by Libya before rebels launched a revolt against Muammar Gaddafi in early 2011 . Libya was added in March to the JWC 's list of areas it considered high risk for merchant vessels and prone to war , strikes , terrorism and related perils . `` Libya provides a useful comparison -- events there were monitored and when it became clear that the situation was deteriorating , the committee acted to list the country , '' the LMA 's Roberts said . `` The JWC is aware of the situation in Syria and are monitoring it .

Air strikes rocked Tripoli several times during the day , witnesses said . The targets were not immediately identified . The government of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi appeared to be increasingly isolated in its stronghold . But government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim , speaking on state television , said : `` We reassure people that we are making progress on all fronts . '' A government official said Ibrahim 's brother , Hasan Ali , had been killed by NATO Apache helicopter gunships . He said the 25-year-old student had gone with a group to check on friends in Zawiyah -- now under rebel control -- after hearing reports of fighting there . He died in the central square . `` We are surprised by this and we condemn it . NATO planes have become a way of killing civilians and providing air cover for rebels to advance on Libyan cities , '' the official said . West of Tripoli Thursday , some 200 rebel fighters firing guns in the air celebrated the capture of Sabratha 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- after a four-day battle . Fighters said the rebels control 90 percent of the ancient Roman town , a UNESCO World Heritage site . Securing Sabratha would tighten their control over supply lines from Tunisia , which were cut at Zawiyah this week . A local man said the breakthrough came after NATO bombed a military facility in Sabratha and rebels seized weapons . Rebel advances in recent days have cut off Gaddafi 's forces from their main resupply routes , ending a long stalemate and putting Gaddafi 's 41-year rule under unprecedented pressure . But insurgents in the east , where casualties have been high , suffered a setback when a group planning to mount an uprising in government-held Zlitan were preempted by Gaddafi forces . `` There are still bodies in the streets . The situation is very difficult . It was a preemptive attack by Gaddafi 's forces , '' an anti-government activist called Mohammed told Reuters by telephone from the town , west of the rebel-held port of Misrata . Four people were killed and five badly wounded when Gaddafi 's troops attacked rebels who aimed to stage a `` mini '' revolt to coincide with a push from Misrata , he said . Despite denials , the rebels and Gaddafi loyalists are in negotiations , former French premier Dominique de Villepin said . He told the daily Le Parisien he held `` extremely difficult '' talks with both Monday , in the Tunisian resort of Djerba . `` I was indeed there , but I can not make any further comment because it would compromise the chances of success , '' he added . The whereabouts of Gaddafi , 69 , are unknown . After a two-day battle , rebel fighters occupied Zawiyah refinery , 50 km west of Tripoli , and raised their flag . `` We took control last night , '' said Saleh Omran , 31 , a fighter from Zawiyah . He said the insurgents fought about 150 Gaddafi troops , who finally fled by sea in inflatable boats . Doctors at a hospital near Zawiyah said nine people were killed and at least 45 injured in fighting around the town and at the refinery Wednesday , most of them rebels . In Geneva , the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- said health care facilities in Libya were being attacked or misused for military purposes by both sides in the conflict . The ICRC expressed concern at a rapid deterioration in the humanitarian situation -- as well as mounting casualties -- in and around Brega , Zawiyah , Garyan , Sabratha and Misrata . `` On Tuesday , in Brega , our delegates saw several ambulances hit by bullets , '' said Georges Comninos who heads the ICRC team in Tripoli . `` This is seriously compromising the delivery of health care to the wounded and sick . '' Rebels also held Garyan , a strategic crossroads town 80 km inland from Tripoli on a main highway south . `` We took one tank and an anti-aircraft gun from Gaddafi 's forces . Next , we 'll go to Tripoli , '' one fighter told Reuters in Garyan , where the captured weapons sat in the town square . On the eastern front , the insurgents said they had tightened their grip around the oil port of Brega , but had suffered high casualties in fighting over the past several days . `` All of Alargop is now free , liberated , '' spokesman Musa Mahmoud al-Mugrabi said of an area 6 km south of Brega , on a supply route for Gaddafi 's forces running south . About 40 rebels have been killed and nearly 100 wounded in and around Brega over the past 10 days , according to a tally of reports from the rebels and hospital workers . `` Casualties have been very high because it 's urban clashes , '' al-Mugrabi said . Gaddafi seemed isolated as forces determined to topple him close in , vowing to enter Tripoli by the end of the month . Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali Al-Mahmoudi declined to comment on any talks other than to say the government has been in contact with all sides . `` You will hear in the next few days good news that will make you happy if you are for peace , '' he said .

The twin crises appear to offer opportunities for U.S. foreign policy -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is an ally of Iran , foe of Israel and sponsor of the armed militant group Hezbollah , while Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has vexed U.S. officials for decades . But they also bring grave risks at a time when Obama is focused on domestic affairs . Between them , Assad and his late father have ruled Syria with iron fists for 41 years . U.S. and European officials privately concede that civil and political chaos in Syria might be the most likely result if Assad abruptly leaves power . Syria 's political opposition is even more disorganized and fragmented than Libyan rebels who now appear to be closing in on Gaddafi 's stronghold in Tripoli . After weeks of resisting , Obama , backed by the European Union , called on Thursday for Assad to go during the same week that Gaddafi 's position in Libya appeared to erode , as rebels seized the key western city of Zawiyeh . With a war-weary U.S. public and tight budgets , the White House has made clear it has no plans to put troops on the ground in Libya or Syria , either to topple their leaders or engage in `` nation-building '' should they depart . `` The same concerns that apparently constrained the administration from calling for Assad 's ouster persist today : how do we force Assad out ? Does the fall of the Alawite regime result in sectarian chaos ? And what comes after this regime amid potential Islamist extremism ? '' said Juan Zarate , a White House counterterrorism adviser to former President George W. Bush . Assad and much of his ruling circle are members of the minority Alawite sect , which makes up about 12 percent of Syria 's population . `` The calculus to call for Assad 's ouster has come too late , and it 's now time to find ways with our partners to shape the coming days in Damascus , '' Zarate said . The Syrian opposition , which ranges from secular reformers to Islamists in the Muslim Brotherhood , has made halting steps at unity . On Friday , more than 40 `` revolution blocs '' announced they had forged a coalition to unite their efforts to overthrow Assad , according to news reports . `` The opposition , on its own and without international involvement , has made significant strides over the past several months to unify , '' a senior U.S. official said this week . `` We ca n't predict how long this transition will take . Nothing about it will be easy . But we 're certain that Assad is on the way out , '' said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . Former CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin predicted the struggle in Syria would go on for some time `` because of Bashar 's limited incentive to cry ` uncle , ' '' but would result ultimately in Assad 's demise . That might be followed by a weak , Sunni-dominated government and McLaughlin said such an outcome would itself present many challenges . He said it would `` transform Syria into a political battleground between competing regional players , mainly Shiite Iran -- which will be losing its closest ally and the avenue through which it supplies its Hezbollah proxy in Lebanon -- and Saudi Arabia , which will see an opportunity to checkmate Iran 's regional influence by aiding Syria 's Sunni majority . `` Just the usual simple Middle East equation -- actually what is already three-dimensional chess will become more like a mosh pit . '' It is unclear how much planning the Obama administration has done for a post-Assad Syria . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met publicly for the first time this month with Syrian activists . But in Libya , a rapid succession of rebel victories has accelerated Western postwar planning , even as officials discounted intelligence reports suggesting Gaddafi 's departure was imminent . The NATO alliance on Friday authorized formal planning for post-Gaddafi Libya . Next week , rebels of the Transitional National Council will meet in Dubai with officials from the United States , Britain , Jordan , United Arab Emirates and perhaps others , `` all devoted to the day-after planning , '' an Obama administration official told Reuters . The working idea is that the UAE , Jordan and Qatar would put together `` a bridging force '' of 1,000 to 2,000 personnel to be deployed in Libya just after Gaddafi goes , the official said . White House officials are concerned that unless transition plans are firmed up now , post-Gaddafi Libya may be chaotic and it may be impossible to fulfill the West 's promise to protect Libya 's population from a humanitarian crisis . Some U.S. and European officials say that despite its better organization and purported recent advances , Libya 's opposition movement is not ready to govern . The optimistic scenario U.S. and European officials hope will develop in Libya is that Gaddafi will decide to go fairly soon but enough of his government and forces will remain intact to enable the formation of a transitional government that can maintain a measure of civil order .

Activists said at least 34 people , including four children , were shot dead by Assad 's forces in the southern province of Deraa , where the uprising against Assad erupted in March , the city of Homs , 165 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- north of Damascus , suburbs of the capital and in the ancient desert city of Palmyra . See you in The Hague , '' chanted protesters in Homs , referring to the Dutch-based international war crimes tribunal . They also shook shoes in the air in a gesture of contempt . `` We want revenge against Maher and Bashar , '' shouted others , referring to the Syrian leader and his powerful brother -- a military commander accused by diplomats and residents of attacking cities and cracking down on pro-democracy protests . Encouraged by growing global pressure on Assad , the Syrian opposition in exile said it would set up a National Council in Turkey on Sunday to support the uprising and help fill any power vacuum should the protests succeed in ousting Assad . Similar initiatives in the past have failed to produce a robust umbrella group to unite the opposition , fragmented by 41 years of Assad 's harsh rule . Assad , from the minority Alawite sect in the mostly Sunni Muslim nation , told U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon this week that military and police operations had stopped . But activists say his forces are still shooting at protesters . The violent repression prompted coordinated calls from the United States and European Union on Thursday for Assad to step down and Washington imposed sweeping new sanctions on Syria , which borders Israel , Lebanon and Iraq and is an ally of Iran . On Friday , European Union states agreed to expand the number of Syrian officials and institutions targeted by EU sanctions and laid out plans for a possible oil embargo . Syria exports over a third of its 385,000 barrels per day output to Europe . Activists said five people were killed and 15 wounded in the ancient desert city of Palmyra , when Assad 's forces opened fire during a demonstration . `` The people want the execution of the president , '' shouted a crowd in the northern Idlib province . Some carried banners with slogans proclaiming `` Signs of Victory '' . Local activist Abdallah Aba Zaid said 18 people were killed in Deraa province , including eight in the town of Ghabaghab , five in Hirak , four in Inkhil and one in Nawa . Dozens of people were wounded , he said . State television blamed the deaths in Ghabaghab on gunmen who attacked a police post , killing a policeman and a civilian and wounding two . It said two members of the security forces and one gunman were killed in a clash in Harasta , near Damascus . Syria has expelled most independent media since the unrest began , making it difficult to verify events on the ground . The United Nations says 2,000 civilians have been killed . Authorities blame `` armed terrorist groups '' and Islamists for the bloodshed and say 500 soldiers and police have been killed . Internet footage of Friday 's protests suggested that , although widespread , they were smaller than at their peak in July , before Assad sent tanks and troops into several cities . But activists say protests have spread to more cities and become more frequent despite assaults that have intensified since the beginning of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan . A doctor in Zabadani , 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- northeast of Damascus , said army vehicles were in the town and snipers were on rooftops to prevent crowds marching . Protesters from the Sunni majority resent the power and wealth amassed by some Alawites , who adhere to an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , and the near monopoly of the sect on the security apparatus . They want Assad to quit , the dismantling of the police state and a transition to democracy . President Barack Obama froze Syrian state assets in the United States , banned U.S. citizens from operating or investing in Syria and prohibited U.S. imports of Syrian oil products . Adding to international pressure , U.N. investigators said Assad 's forces had committed violations that may amount to crimes against humanity . The United Nations plans to send a team to Syria on Saturday to assess the humanitarian situation . The United States , Britain and European allies say they will draft a U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution on Syria . Despite the dramatic sharpening of Western rhetoric , there is no threat of Western military action like that against Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi , meaning Assad 's conflict with his opponents seems likely to grind on in the streets .

Libyan government tanks and snipers put up scattered resistance in Tripoli after rebels swept into the heart of the capital , cheered on by crowds hailing the end of Muammar Gaddafi 's 42 years in power . `` A resolution of the conflict is modestly bearish for crude oil prices , but it is less likely that we will get a $ 10 - $ 20 drop in price of crude , '' Jason Schenker , president at Prestige Economics LLC in Austin , Texas , said in a note . `` While the fundamentals of the conflict resolution appear at first glance to be only bearish , it could turn out to be quite bullish , as it could engender further conflict in the region , '' Schenker said . Brent losses were limited by the dollar 's weakness . DXY and the greenback 's slip and a bounce by equities on Wall Street helped lift U.S. crude prices , for both the expiring front-month September and October contracts . The euro edged up , helped by a rise in European shares , while the dollar weakened on speculation that the Federal Reserve may show some indication this week about the need to take additional measures to support an ailing economy .

Brent 's premium to U.S. crude narrowed to $ 24.05 a barrel , after reaching a record $ 26.69 on Friday . Part of U.S. crude divergence from Brent is because traders are starting to bail out of their Brent\\/U . S. spread positions , said Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute . Speculators raised slightly their long exposure to Brent in the week to August 16 , data from the Intercontinental Exchange showed . Selling by `` soft longs '' who increased exposure last week and profit taking by traders with long-held positions could put more short-term pressure on Brent , according to brokers . Libya pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- , nearly 2 percent of global supply , before the war cut its output . Most of Libya 's high-quality crude flowed to European refiners .

The implosion of Gaddafi 's rule after six months of civil war in which the rebels benefited from sanctions on Gaddafi , a no-fly zone and NATO air strikes may have implications for Syri 's six-month-old revolt and Assad 's efforts to crush it . `` The international community will now think that its strong intervention in the struggle -LRB- in Syria -RRB- will resolve the situation , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein . `` Libya has raised the morale of the West and it will have a bigger excuse to intervene . But we reject any military action in Syria . '' Hussein and other opposition activists said however the events in Tripoli would revive Syrian protesters ' hopes . `` What happened in Libya means a lot for us , it means that the Arab spring is coming without doubt ... there is no solution to any problem without the will of the people , '' said Michel Kilo , a prominent opposition figure . No country has proposed the kind of action in Syria which NATO forces have carried out in Libya . But the West has called on Assad to step down and Washington has imposed new sanctions over his crackdown , in which the United Nations says 2,200 civilians have died . Syria has an alliance with Iran and a key role in Lebanon , despite ending a 29-year military presence there in 2005 . It also has influence in Iraq and supports militant groups Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah . Assad on Sunday said Syria would not bow to external pressure , which he said could only affect `` a president made in the United States and a subservient people who get their orders from outside . '' `` As for the threat of a military action ... any action against Syria will have greater consequences -LRB- on those who carry it out -RRB- , greater than they can tolerate , '' he said . Assad has responded to the unrest with a mixture of reforms and force . He granted citizenship to hundreds of thousands of ethnic Kurds , ended a state of emergency and promised to let groups other than his Baath party run in elections . Analysts and opposition figures said they expected the situation in Syria to deteriorate further , with authorities intensifying the crackdown and protesters not backing down . `` After what happened in Libya I think he -LRB- Assad -RRB- will be tougher with the security option he is taking , '' Boumonsef said . `` He sees what -LRB- he calls -RRB- the international conspiracy on him will be stronger and now that Gaddafi is out of the way it will move toward him in full strength ... This is imminent . '' Some opposition figures expressed fears that Libya 's endgame might encourage voices among the opposition calling for the arming of a hitherto largely peaceful movement in Syria . `` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said Hussein , who was detained during the uprising . `` But we will resist such proposals , regardless of where they are coming from . '' The anti-Assad movement is fragmented . `` Despite everything that is happening , the opposition remains stuck over little issues like personal issues between its leaders , '' Kilo said . Boumonsef said it would try harder , with international help , to unify . `` The opposition will be motivated more . There is no return and -LRB- Assad 's -RRB- reforms will not stop anything . It is too late . '' Encouraged after Western leaders called on Assad to step down , Syrian opposition figures are holding talks in Istanbul to nominate a broad-based council that could aid in a transition of power if Assad is toppled . Unlike previous opposition conferences , which were marked by divisions between Islamists and liberals , participants said there was broad agreement on 120 nominees for the council from inside and outside Syria . The council would speak for dissidents in exile and activists on the ground , opposition figures told Reuters . But some poured cold water on the idea . `` There is no interest inside Syria in a conference happening outside because the public opinion and those inside Syria believe that what is happening outside is marginal , '' Kilo said . `` We do not need a transitional council ... the real challenge is not what should be done after the regime collapses but for us it is what should be done every day so that we remain standing .

Security Council sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and several other top officials , council diplomats told Reuters on Monday . Speaking on condition of anonymity , diplomats said the resolution 's drafters -- the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Portugal -- included several Syrian firms that they hoped to blacklist and urged referring Syria 's clampdown on protests to the permanent war-crimes tribunal in The Hague . Typically , U.N. sanctions against individuals include an international travel ban and mandatory freezing of any financial assets . Sanctioned companies face an asset freeze and it becomes illegal for any firm to do business with them . A senior Western diplomat hinted last week that the proposed sanctions could include an arms embargo . Moscow might have trouble with that because Russia is a long-standing arms supplier for Damascus . `` There are four names of individuals and two or three entities -LRB- firms -RRB- , '' a diplomat familiar with negotiations said . The five Western powers hoped to circulate a draft to the other 10 council members . Once it reaches the full 15-nation council , there will be further negotiations and the text will likely be revised . Another diplomat confirmed the envoy 's remarks . The United Nations ' human rights chief , Navi Pillay , last week recommended the Security Council refer Syria 's crackdown to the International Criminal Court in The Hague , saying the government may have been guilty of war crimes . Diplomats said the draft would call for an ICC referral . RUSSIA , CHINA RELUCTANT TO SANCTION SYRIA The ICC issued arrest warrants for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , his son Saif al-Islam and his intelligence chief in June after the council referred Libya 's crackdown on pro-democracy protests to the court in February . It is unclear whether the rebels plan to hand over any of the detained suspects . Russia and China traditionally oppose the use of sanctions against any U.N. member state and have worked hard for months to prevent the Security Council from imposing punitive measures on Damascus . Russia has long had close ties to Syria and its top arms exporter has vowed to continue supplying it with weapons . But Western diplomats said Moscow and Beijing -- as well as Brazil , India and South Africa -- might be persuaded that the time has come to take action against Assad . The Syrian leader has ignored an August 3 demand by the Security Council to end the use of military force against civilian protesters . Syrian forces shot dead three people in the city of Homs during a visit by a U.N. humanitarian team on Monday , activists said , and the United Nations said the civilian death toll from President Bashar al-Assad 's crackdown on anti-government protests has reached 2,200 since March . Russia , China , South Africa , Brazil and India have warned against escalating the standoff with Syria into a Libyan-style foreign military intervention against the government of Assad , who Washington and the European Union have said should step down . The Russians , South Africans and Indians have urged dialogue with Damascus and said that Assad needs time to implement promised reforms .

China , Cuba and Russia were among the few delegations to speak in support of Syria at the U.N. Human Rights Council , rejecting what they called any interference with its sovereignty or territorial integrity . But the United States and the European Union , as well as regional powers Egypt , Israel and Saudi Arabia , accused the government of President Bashar al-Assad of waging an unacceptable assault on unarmed civilians . More than 2,200 people have been killed in the five-month-old crackdown by Syrian forces , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a speech . `` The military and security forces continue to employ excessive force , including heavy artillery , to quell peaceful demonstrations and regain control over the residents of various cities , '' she told the 47-member forum whose session continues on Tuesday . Pillay , a former U.N. war crimes judge , called for the government to halt its repression of peaceful protests and release all people detained for participating in them . U.S. envoy Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe said the urgent session , the second on Syria this year , underscored the growing international isolation of Assad . Syria 's ambassador Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui rejected U.N. allegations that Syrian forces had committed crimes against humanity and accused `` large states '' of carrying out a misleading campaign to weaken his government . Syria was carrying out political reforms including the start of a national dialogue , he said . More than 600 members of the armed forces had been killed in the unrest so far , he said . Russia backed its ally . `` These are not just peaceful demonstrators . They are refusing to engage in dialogue and insist on the overthrow of authorities and frequently use weapons , '' Russia 's envoy Valery Loshchinin told the talks . Khabbaz Hamoui said Damascus was willing to allow U.N. investigators into the country as soon as a Syrian judicial commission had completed its work . `` It is the first we have heard of this offer , '' U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told Reuters . Russia 's Loshchinin welcomed Syria 's offer as reflecting a `` constructive attitude '' and openness to international dialogue . The United States , the European Union and Arab nations want to set up an international inquiry into atrocities by Syrian government forces . An initial United Nations investigation , whose results were issued last week , said the government 's crackdown on opposition demonstrators -- marked by killings , disappearances and torture -- might amount to crimes against humanity . `` The United States deplores Assad 's campaign of ever-increasing brutality and terror against unarmed innocents , which may amount to crimes against humanity , '' U.S. ambassador Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe told the Council . Assad 's forces shot dead three people in Homs on Monday as crowds welcomed a U.N. humanitarian team , activists there said . `` Security forces continue to arbitrarily detain peaceful protesters and human rights defenders , holding them incommunicado and subjecting many to torture , '' said Julie de Rivero of the New York-based group Human Rights Watch . A draft resolution presented by some 25 council members , including all four Arab members -LRB- Jordan , Kuwait , Qatar and Saudi Arabia -RRB- as well as non-member Tunisia , would set up an international commission of inquiry . It would report back by the end of November and its findings would be sent to the U.N. Secretary-General and `` relevant bodies . '' Activists want prosecutions by the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- and hope the Human Rights Council will recommend the court 's involvement to the U.N. Security Council . The Rights Council can not itself authorize ICC involvement . Investigators from the office of Pillay say that they have drawn up a confidential list of 50 alleged perpetrators . `` It is high time that this Council responds decisively to the growing number of crimes against humanity and sends a clear signal to perpetrators that they will be held accountable individually for such crimes , '' Peter Splinter of Amnesty International said . China , Cuba and Russia want to remove the reference to crimes against humanity from the resolution , in exchange for joining a consensus , according to Radwan Ziadeh , an exiled Syrian activist who heads the Washington-based Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies and is attending the Geneva session . -LRB- Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay ; editing by Andrew Roche and Elizabeth Fullerton -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "79", "dct": "2011-08-22", "dates": ["2011-08-22", "2011-08-22", "2011-08-22", "2012-06-01", "2012-07-01", "2011-08-01", "2011-10-01", "2011-01-01", "2011-01-01", "2011-08-01", "2009-03-01", "2010-01-01"], "text": "LONDON | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 3:39 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Bank of England policymaker Ben Broadbent has softened his hawkish stance on inflation because of concerns over economic weakness , he said in an interview on Monday , his first since joining the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee . The former Goldman Sachs economist succeeded arch-hawk Andrew Sentance on the Bank 's nine-man rate-setting body , but has not copied Sentance 's stance , voting to leave monetary policy unchanged in June , July and August . The UK economy is squeezed between high inflation -- more than double the Bank 's two percent target -- and low growth , and a Reuters poll consensus last week was for interest rates to be kept at record lows at least until next October . `` It 's clear that the outlook has softened since earlier this year , and the latest forecasts both internationally and for the domestic economy are for continued growth but at a rate lower than people expected some months ago and certainly lower than one would expect in a , quote , normal economic recovery , '' Broadbent told BBC Radio 4 . `` I was probably on that -LRB- hawkish -RRB- side of the debate when I arrived at the Bank earlier this year ... I was concerned that a long period of above-target inflation might dislodge medium-term expectations of future inflation and find their way into other prices and wages , '' he added . `` That has n't happened and , as I say , the outlook for growth domestically as well as globally has weakened in the last three or four months , so I would describe myself now as much more in the middle of the debate . '' Broadbent said the MPC 's assumption was that there had been a permanent loss of output in Britain and appeared to hint at a scenario in which more quantitative easing would be considered . `` I still believe there 's significant spare capacity in the economy , and that means that interest rates are low , '' he said . `` If that outlook changed in a way which would lower the prospects for inflation over the medium term , maybe more could be done . '' The Bank last week inched closer to launching a second round of quantitative easing after two policymakers unexpectedly dropped their call for higher interest rates . Only long-standing dove Adam Posen called for more QE this month but other policymakers considered it . The Bank has held rates at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009 and purchased 200 billion pounds of financial assets , mostly gilts , with newly-created money between then and January 2010 . -LRB- Reporting by Keith Weir and Olesya Dmitracova ; editing by Stephen Nisbet -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "15", "dct": "2011-08-23", "dates": ["2011-08-22", "2011-08-23", "2011-08-23", "2011-08-22", "2011-01-01", "2011-08-18", "2011-08-20", "2011-01-01", "2008-01-01", "2011-08-20", "2011-08-22", "2011-08-23", "2011-08-17", "2010-01-01", "2011-08-22", "2011-08-22"], "text": "Emergencies management officials remove trees from a road after Hurricane Irene hit the municipality of Loiza , August 22 , 2011 . SANTO DOMINGO | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 6:40 am BST SANTO DOMINGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Hurricane Irene could hit the Southeast United States as a major Category 3 storm on the weekend after sweeping north of the Dominican Republic and pummelling Puerto Rico on Monday , forecasters said . The U.S. National Hurricane Center 's five-day forecast showed the first hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic season swinging up Florida 's east coast on Thursday for a possible landfall in South Carolina on Saturday . Irene , the ninth named storm of the busy 2011 Atlantic season , looks set to be the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Ike savaged the Texas coast in 2008 . Authorities along the United States ' Atlantic seaboard , from Miami to New York , were closely watching the possible path of Irene , with at least some computer forecast models showing it might even sweep up near New York City early next week . President Barack Obama was briefed about Irene while on vacation at Martha 's Vineyard , Massachusetts , White House officials said . At 5 p.m. EDT Irene was skirting the Dominican Republic 's north coast , carrying winds of 130 kph , the Miami-based hurricane center said . The storm 's center was about 80 km northeast of Punta Cana , a major tourist zone in the east of the Dominican Republic . Earlier , Irene buffeted Puerto Rico with winds and heavy rain , knocking out power and downing trees in the U.S. territory as it churned westward on a track that will take it over the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas before approaching south Florida . Hotels in the Dominican Republic 's Punta Cana area closed their beaches and asked guests to stay indoors for safety . `` We 've recommended that they stay in their rooms , '' Beatriz Lopez , a spokesperson for the Grand Palladium resort , said , and other hotels reported similar precautions . The NHC said Irene would track just north of Hispaniola island , shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti , on Monday , sweep near or over the Turks and Caicos and southeast Bahamas on Tuesday , and near the central Bahamas early on Wednesday . Hispaniola has impoverished Haiti on its western side and there were fears that rain from Irene could trigger deadly floods and mudslides in the country , which is still struggling to recover from a devastating 2010 earthquake . The U.S. military hospital ship Comfort , which was treating patients and carrying out surgeries in the Haitian port capital of Port-au-Prince , was ordered by its commanders to suspend its operations and seek safe haven at the approach of Irene . LANDFALL AS CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE PREDICTED Irene was a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity , but the NHC saw it strengthening into a Category 3 major hurricane over the Bahamas , with winds over 111 mph -LRB- 178 kph -RRB- . It was seen making U.S. landfall as a Category 3 . Forecasters said a low pressure trough over the eastern United States was expected to keep Irene 's track to the east , reducing the risk of a direct landfall in densely populated south Florida , and steering it instead to the Carolinas . Current forecasts showed Irene posing no threat to U.S. oil and gas installations in the Gulf of Mexico . In Puerto Rico , authorities said nearly 800 people had sought refuge at emergency shelters as the hurricane passed . There were no reports of deaths or major injuries . But 800,000 people -- about half of the island 's electricity customers and including the capital , San Juan -- were left without power by the storm , which also felled trees , swelled rivers over their banks and flooded some roads . Governor Luis Fortuno said the worst-hit area was the east coast , from Fajardo to Yabucoa , and he had asked the U.S. government to declare Puerto Rico a disaster area so it can gain access to emergency funds . On Monday morning , rains and winds had already eased in San Juan and the airport was expected to reopen . Schools and government offices were closed for Monday in the U.S. territory of 3.9 million people , but tropical storm warnings were lifted after the hurricane passed .

Thomas Jefferson once said rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God . The Arab Spring is reminding the world that struggles for dignity , freedom , justice and human rights spring from our deepest aspirations as human beings . At the same time the dictatorial violence in Syria and Libya remind us of the evil that springs from the insatiable will to absolute power . The repression in Syria has claimed more than 2,200 lives according to the United Nations . Thankfully , the bloodshed is coming to an end in Libya , but it must be remembered that in Libya , unlike Tunisia and Egypt , it took a bloody civil war and NATO intervention to destroy the decades-long tyranny of Muammar Gaddafi . Events in Libya compel us to reflect on fundamental moral questions that are larger than geopolitics and the price of petroleum . But it is impossible to reflect on those moral questions without scrutinizing the compromising attitudes that stem from our acute concerns about national security and access to cheap oil . In September 2004 the United States lifted economic sanctions leveled against the Gaddafi regime in response to its most egregious act of terror -- the destruction of Pan 103 in December 1988 . The Bush administration restored full diplomatic relations two years later . It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . Pan Am 103 was not Gaddafi s only act of terror : his intelligence service was behind the destruction of a TWA flight in 1974 and sponsored the Abu Nidal organizations acts of terrorism well into the 1980s -- acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . President Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . The Bush administration cited Gaddafi s shrewd decision to dismantle a crude nuclear weapons program and its payment of reparations to the families of the victims of Pan Am 103 to justify the opening of an American embassy in Tripoli . Neither of these empty gestures translated into a fundamental change in the nature of the Gaddafi tyranny . Gaddafi cunningly suspended the foreign terror operations but continued to terrorize the Libyan people with the confidence of a tyrant with a new lease on life . President Bush never openly condemned the repression in Libya , despite his lofty rhetoric about America 's commitment to democracy in the Middle East at the onset of the war in Iraq . The appeasement with Libya was always about petroleum , never about principle . September 11 deepened the Bush administration s disturbing relationship with Gaddafi . The administration secretly reached out to Libyan intelligence to cooperate in the global war on terrorism . In their memoirs , former CIA officials describe surreal meetings with Libyan intelligence chieftains whom they suspected of involvement in the destruction of Pan Am 103 . Libyan officials were only too pleased to identify , detain and torture Libyans who gravitated to Al Qaeda at the behest of the CIA . Perhaps the collaboration with Libyan intelligence seemed like a morally acceptable compromise after the slaughter of Americans on 9\\/11 , but the secret partnership with Gaddafi served emboldened him in his secret campaign to ratchet up the repression in Libya . If rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God , then surely compromise with tyrants smacks of a pact with the devil . The challenge of reconciling U.S. economic and security interests with American values has always vexed Americans in high office . But Libya under Gaddafi was a simple case of moral and political discernment . The United States failed that test badly . America gained nothing of lasting value from its relationship with Gaddafi . It only bought a tyrant more time , and cost more Libyan lives .

REUTERS\\/Bob Strong `` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' The U.S. has supported many brutal tyrants : Saddam Hussein , Augusto Pinochet , Hosni Mubarak , Doc Chevalier , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos , Suharto , and Somoza just to name a few . Supporting Gaddafi falls into the category of normal U.S. geopolitics . Americans having been willing , decade after decade , to vote for leaders who have supported brutal dictators around the world . Where then is the conflict with American values ? American values seem to include supporting dictators around the world whenever various geopolitical goals are at stake . `` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' Bush brought Gaddafi back into the international fold because Gaddafi renounced nuclear weapons . You think that 's insignificant ? NATO is a big reason for the bloodshed in Libya today . Talk to the current president if you have a problem with that . And by the way , Gaddafi only dreamed of and talked about perpetrating the kind of violence against demonstrators that Syria 's Assad is actually doing . I do n't see America doing much about that , other than finger wagging . Although Republicans in the US often pain themselves as foreign policy experts , their actions and policies are often bizzare . In the late 90 ? The Bush administration officially praised the Taliban for helping to eradicate Afghanistan 's poppy crop about 6 months before the Sept 11 attacks . The whole Iraq war\\/weapons of mass destruction thing speaks for itself . For the Bush administration , driven by a family so steeped in big oil , their crazy decisions all seemed to revolve around gaining access to oil fields , either through force or diplomacy . I believe McCain even cast doubt on Pakistan 's previously democratically elected leaders and praised the military dictator running Pakistan at that time . And with all of the military escapades of the Bush administration , when Obama announced limited US engagement in Lybia , the Republicans cried foul . George Bush Sr. ran a smooth and reasonable campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait in the early 90 ? s.

'' I think it started more because of economic woes . Regarding Gaddafi renouncing nuclear weapons as being significant ... it was , and no dictator will ever do that again after what we just did . The Bush Administration was an institution without morals . Still , its legacy is vested in the Tea Party revolutionary movement of today . I presume the London School of Economics is mourning Gadaffi 's fall from power . If ever there was an fine example of lefties consorting with dictators -LRB- as the right correctly argues -RRB- LSE 's ` friendship ' with Gaddafi must be it . So much for standing up for the people . The left is all about grabbing power in any shape or form . Nothing for nothing , but I think you need to go back to your research and check on something ... `` acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . President Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . While I think this is a little sensationalist to say that Americans were the primary targets in these attacks , these were attacks specifically against Israel and Israelis targeting El Al airlines ticket counters in Italy and Austria by Abu Nadil as retaliation against Israel for Operation Wooden Leg , where Israel bombed the PLO headquarters in Tunis -LRB- 10\\/85 -RRB- . This had nothing to do with an attack on American children at all . I would suffice to say that if Americans were killed as additional damage , that Abu Nadil would n't have minded , however , that was not their main goal . All too reminiscent of our early ties with Saddam Hussein . We armed him to the teeth to be a counterweight to Iran and to guarantee the stability of Gulf oil . And then he began to feel invincible . We all know how that ended . Keep an eye an Saudi Arabia . We might see something similar happen there in the years to come . Thanks for explaining so much . Ms. Clinton continued the tradition of Gaddafi-coddling by a stubborn reluctance to support the rebels . Obama was finally shamed into doing some air support for rebels when France and Britain took the leadership . The Nato bombing started much too late . When Nato started air strikes , Gaddafi 's long exposed armored columns were now in the cities terrorizing citizens and the opportunity to wipe them out quickly was gone . Without a doubt Oil is always an issue for the US in the ME . The next issue is the welfare of Israel , still he only country actually eating another territory\\/country alive . But the US has only itself to blame for its dependence on oil -- wherever the source . It had spent the last 50 plus years building urban areas enslaved by the automakers . Most of the oil it uses is for transportation and home heating costs . it also uses more than any other country on a daily for auto use alone . the last note got sent accidentally . The problem is -- there is no fix for suburban sprawl . It 's too diffuse and too expensive to service with adequate alternative transportation and many of the old rail lines are gone and their ROW 's are being eaten by encroachment by abutters or put to alternate uses like bicycle and hiking paths . The sprawl itself usually kills off any local agriculture so the urban areas ca n't feed themselves at all without trucking everything from thousands of miles away . I look at Google earth to view urban areas world wide and very few of them -- even the gigantic areas like Sao Paolo , Or Beijing and even most European Cities look they are still being constructed around rail lines or other public transportation systems . Large areas of Japan have become continuous city . But they have 180 million people I recall . The radiating valleys in the Kyoto area are continuous strips of farmsteads that all front on the common roads . It must be easy to run regular bus lines along any of them to the nearest located rail lines . As the country ages , it will become more difficult for seniors to have to live without public transportation . Nursing home life is a miserable and very expensive way to die . And owning a car is becoming more expensive . This country has made walking for daily errands or taking a bus or train impractical for any but inner city commuters residents . The private automobile is one of the factors behind the trillions spent in foreign wars . The biggest public transportation subsidies are being eaten by the automakers and it is the most inefficient way to move people . And all of the above to be held hostage by the cost of gas . Very stupid and not at all worth it . There 's a mistake in the last paragraph .

Seeking a response to the worst urban violence for decades , commentators and politicians have looked back to 1981 when Heseltine led efforts to tackle deprivation in the northern English city of Liverpool that had sparked similar unrest . Heseltine , now 78 , garnered praise for his efforts to promote private investment in a city struggling for an identity after its port went into decline , causing mass unemployment . Liverpool 's regenerated Albert Dock , home to a branch of the Tate Art Gallery and a Beatles museum , is one project that has brought lasting benefits to the city . Thirty years on , many English cities still look to national government to solve their problems , something that Heseltine wants to change . Few city mayors are directly elected and councils get much of their funding from central grants , leaving them exposed to deep state spending cuts . Heseltine is widely seen in the Conservative Party as a politician close to the thinking of Prime Minister David Cameron and one with a particular grasp of the problems of inner cities . He believes Cameron 's Conservative-led coalition government has done the right thing with its initial hardline response to the riots , flooding the streets with police and arresting around 3,000 people . `` You have got to regain the streets . That they have done and rightly so , '' Heseltine said in an interview . `` It would be for example a tragedy if the Notting Hill carnival was not to go ahead and be peacefully conducted , '' he added , referring to this weekend 's African-Caribbean festival in London , one of the biggest street parties in Europe . Prime Minister David Cameron had already asked Heseltine and former Tesco supermarket boss Terry Leahy , who is from Liverpool , to produce an updated development plan for the city . That report is sure to be required reading for those seeking to ease the plight of England 's inner cities . Relations with prime ministers have not always been so cordial . Heseltine , a millionaire magazine publisher , was one of the most talented politicians of his generation but his dominant personality and centrist leanings made for combustible relations with then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . He stormed out of government in 1986 in a row over the ownership of a defense firm . His leadership challenge in 1990 helped to end Thatcher 's reign but the more emollient John Major piped him to become party leader and prime minister . Now retired from front line politics , Heseltine says there is no quick fix after looting of shops and arson attacks spread from London to other major English cities , leaving five people dead , businesses in ruins and damaging Britain 's image abroad . He is careful not to telegraph the conclusions of his report on Liverpool , but he believes the centralised government and the dominance of London , home to the financial services industry , is holding the country back . `` We are the only country of our sort that runs virtually everything from the center , if you look at all the other major economies they have very powerful devolved and therefore competitive economies , '' he said . Britain 's deficit-cutting government talks about rebalancing the economy -- helping to nurture high-tech manufacturing and spreading growth more evenly geographically . Plans to create low-tax , light-regulation enterprise zones echo the Heseltine prescription of the 1980s . Heseltine said large English cities like Liverpool , Manchester , Newcastle and Birmingham needed strong local leaders to complement this approach . `` They do n't have people who have the power to take real decisions and give proper leadership , '' he said , applauding government plans to allow larger English cities to directly elect their mayors . He notes that London 's high profile mayor Boris Johnson has very limited powers , making him more of a figurehead . In an illustration of London 's problems , the interview was conducted by telephone , with the Reuters correspondent in Heseltine 's office in the district of Hammersmith surrounded by racks of his firm 's magazines and the ex-minister stranded in snarled traffic and unable to get to the appointment in person . Thatcher was famously dismissive of Heseltine 's contribution to urban renewal , noting acidly in her memoirs that `` Liverpool has defeated better men than Michael Heseltine . '' However , Heseltine has his backers in the city , birthplace of the Beatles and home to one of Europe 's most successful soccer clubs . `` Heseltine is respected across the political divide as somebody who has put Liverpool 's case regularly , '' said Joe Anderson , the Labor leader of the city council . `` All governments have n't got to grips with the problems that inner cities faced . He 's right to make the case that government seems to be London-centric , '' he told Reuters . `` Liverpool was once an economic powerhouse of the Commonwealth and he sees the potential here .

CAMBRIDGE , England | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 11:49 am BST CAMBRIDGE , England -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Got 48 hours to explore the colleges , pubs , green spaces and leafy towpaths of Cambridge , England ? Reuters correspondents with local knowledge help visitors get the most out of a visit to the city that is home to one of world 's oldest universities . 6 p.m. Arrive at Cambridge train station and breathe in the soft air of the Fenlands . Cambridge is a town of cyclists , where everyone from students to software millionaires ride bicycles to get around . If you want to get the most out of the city , you can rent one too right outside the station at Station Cycles -LRB- www.stationcycles.co.uk -RRB- . Buy a map while you 're at it . If you 're staying in the center of town and you like a bit of history , stop in at The Eagle . It is one of the oldest pubs in Cambridge , dating back to the 1600s with a galleried courtyard for outdoor drinkers . A plaque outside will tell you this is the pub where Cambridge scientists Watson and Crick cracked the secret of DNA and there will likely be plenty of modern-day geniuses knocking back their Friday night pints . The ceiling in the RAF room at the back is festooned with the smoky signatures of World War Two airmen stationed around Cambridge , who wrote their names in soot on the ceiling before flying off to confront the Luftwaffe . 11 p.m. Most pubs in Cambridge still close near or around this traditional closing time , though some stay open past midnight . You could try the nightlife if you 're keen . There are at least three busy late night clubs close by The Eagle : The Kambar , Lola Lo and Fez Club . But beware it 's an early start in the morning ... 8 a.m. Rowing is a Cambridge passion , though the Cambridge University Boat Club -LRB- www.cubc.org.uk -RRB- lost the 157th `` Boat Race '' against Oxford this year . Nevertheless , students , lecturers , top athletes and keen amateurs all turn out in the early morning for a row . If you 're in Cambridge in early June you can see the Cambridge University `` May Bumps '' races for the student `` gownies '' or in late July the Town Bumps for `` townies . '' Both sets of races are a big spectacle and bring thousands of people to the river for four days of rowing mayhem , dinners , picnics , parties , BBQs and bonfires . The races are conducted in boats with crews of eight who chase each other down the river intent on overtaking to `` bump '' the crew ahead . Crashes , sinkings and even rowers knocked out of boats are regular occurrences . Bankside , cyclists race along the towpaths screaming support for their teams , so watch out ! Cycle out across Midsummer Common to the towpath to see the rowing or just look at the lovely college boathouses perched on the banks , with their escutcheons proudly displayed . Foremost of these is Goldie Boathouse -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , where the Cambridge University team conduct their indoor training . If you 're lucky , the doors will be open and a number of scantily clad top athletes will be getting put through their paces . 12 p.m. Hit the pub . The riverside pubs in Cambridge are gorgeous on a fair day and filled with rowers . Most have outdoor seating and serve food . One of the oldest is the Fort St. George , right on the banks of the Cam . Just up the road is the Old Spring . Further along the river heading out of town towards Ely are the Green Dragon and about an hour 's cycle is The Bridge at Waterbeach . If you 've gone to the Bridge at Waterbeach then you 'll have to cycle back into town . After a big lunch and a few pints it might take longer than expected . Do n't rush , the river outside of town is surrounded by picturesque countryside and home to herons , ducks , swans and kingfishers . Sheep and horses can sometimes be seen grazing in fields by the bank . 3 p.m. Do n't abandon the river just yet . After all the excitement of the rowing and hours in the saddle , it 's time for you to get on the Cam yourself for a glorious introduction to the gardens and architecture in Cambridge . The river wends its way through the middle of town and around the back of some of the university 's oldest colleges . The best way to drink it in is from a traditional punt on the river . There are any number of hire companies , but one of the biggest is Scudamore 's -LRB- www.scudamores.com -RRB- . Feel free to attempt punting -- propelling the traditional flat-bottomed wooden boat using a wooden pole -- yourself . But beware that it 's a hilarious past-time for locals to snigger at the hapless tourists who end up spluttering in the river when their pole becomes stuck and their punt slides out from under them . A more relaxing way to see the college `` Backs '' is to hire a chauffeur , often a student , who will propel you along regaling you with the history of the colleges while you laze in the punt eating strawberries and cream , drinking Pimm 's and enjoying the blooming gardens and the serene beauty all around you . 6 p.m. Drop into the Granta pub overlooking the Mill Pond or The Mill for a swift pint or two after your punting and before you get changed for dinner . There are a number of good restaurants for fine dining in Cambridge and of course , plenty of pubs . For the pub option take your pick of the pubs reviewed by Cambridge Pubs , with a map and descriptions at www.cambridge-pubs.co.uk . Cambridge has a number of good fine dining options . Midsummer House Restaurant -LRB- www.midsummerhouse.co.uk -RRB- has two Michelin stars and is located right on the river on Midsummer Common next to the Fort St. George pub . It is set in a converted Victorian house serving French Mediterranean food . Cotto restaurant -LRB- www.cottocambridge.co.uk -RRB- has n't the Michelin stars but boasts that it uses only the freshest ingredients sourced locally . Hotel Du Vin -LRB- www.hotelduvin.com\\/HotelLanding.aspx ? HotelId = 7 -RRB- , in the center of town has an 80-seat bistro serving European cuisine . 11 p.m. Go home to bed or brave the raucous Saturday night clubs in town . There will be plenty of walking tomorrow to get round the colleges . Now that you 've had what the British refer to as `` a lie-in '' you should feel ready to tackle Cambridge on foot in order to have a close-up look at an academic institution whose life began in 1209 and whose alumni range from Isaac Newton , Charles Darwin and William Wordsworth to Stephen Hawking , actor Hugh Laurie and Sacha Baron Cohen , the man behind Borat . You 'll never get through all the colleges as there are many and some will be closed to visitors . But a good place to start is at the bottom of St. John 's Street next to the 12th century Round Church , founded by the Fraternity of the Holy Sepulchre . Have a peep inside at the Romanesque architecture . Wander up St. John street from here , taking in the colleges . Two of the biggest and most interesting to wander around are Trinity and King 's . Pop into Trinity -LRB- www.trin.cam.ac.uk -RRB- through the Great Gate . On the outside of the college , is a statue of its founder , Henry VIII . Some years ago the statue 's sceptre was replaced by a chair leg as an undergraduate prank . Ask the tourist porter at the gate if you can have a wander round . Visitors must pay a small entrance fee , but then have the opportunity to see the college chapel , Great Court , Hall , Nevile 's Court and the magnificent Wren library completed in 1695 to the design of Christopher Wren . The library contains a number of special collections including medieval manuscripts ; early Shakespeare editions ; books from Newton 's own library and A.A. Milne 's manuscripts of Winnie-the-Pooh . Wander the courtyards and buildings that have inspired 32 Nobel prizewinners as well as Francis Bacon , Lord Byron , and Alfred Tennyson . 12 p.m. Press on along the same street , although it 's now called Trinity Street , past the grand Senate House , where formal ceremonies are held . You should now be on King 's Parade , a grand boulevard where stand the impressive buildings of King 's College -LRB- founded in 1441 -RRB- . Call in at the Porter 's lodge to gain entry to the beautiful court and grounds inside , where one of the most famous sights is King 's College chapel . The foundation stone was laid in 1446 and it took over a century to build , including an interruption during the War of the Roses . The chapel houses the painting `` The Adoration of the Magi '' by Rubens . Every Christmas eve Carols at King 's is broadcast around the world . 2 p.m. Trundle up King 's Parade onto Trumpington Street and stop at Browns -LRB- www.browns-restaurants.co.uk\\/menu-cambridge.php -RRB- for hearty lunch fare or Loch Fyne -LRB- www.lochfyne.com\\/Restaurants\\/Locations\\/Cambridge.aspx -RRB- for seafood . You can return to wandering around the colleges in the afternoon if you have n't had enough academic history . For a lazier afternoon option punt , take a taxi or cycle to Grantchester Meadows just out of town where students for generations have whiled away the hours reading , picnicking in an area made famous by World War One poet Rupert Brooke in his poem `` The Old Vicarage , Grantchester '' . The Orchard Tea Garden -- where Brooke once lolled under the trees and ruminated -- serves morning coffee , light lunches , afternoon tea and champagne to guests who can rest their weary bones in wood and canvas chairs under the very same boughs . Though the Old Vicarage is now home to novelist Jeffrey Archer , you can still see the church clock stand at ten to three and there really is honey still for tea .

Security Council sanctions on Syria for its bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators is meeting fierce resistance from Russia and China , U.N. diplomats said . The United States , Britain , France , Germany and Portugal have circulated a draft resolution that calls for sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , influential members of his family and close associates . They say they want to put it to a vote as soon as possible . The measures are not as severe as U.S. sanctions in place and a proposed expansion of European Union steps against Damascus that would forbid the import of Syrian oil . Diplomats said there were no plans for a vote yet . Russia 's U.N. ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , has hinted that Moscow would use its veto power to knock down the draft if it were put to a vote at the current time . Western diplomats said Russia and China were refusing to discuss the draft . `` The Russians say they have no instructions , '' a diplomat told Reuters on Friday on condition of anonymity . As a result , Western diplomats in New York said their capitals would have to get involved to persuade Moscow and Beijing to join negotiations on the draft resolution to reach a consensus among the 15 Security Council members . `` Clearly we need this to be unlocked at the capital level because there is very strong resistance from Russia and China , '' a diplomat said . Brazil , India and South Africa have also been reluctant to sanction -- or even condemn -- Syria , whose five-month crackdown on demonstrators has killed at 2,200 , according to U.N. figures from earlier this week . But one diplomat said the three countries , all of which aspire to become permanent members of an expanded Security Council , were now `` constructively engaging on the text . '' Russia on Friday proposed putting to a vote a rival resolution it has drafted on Syria , but one Western envoy described it as `` toothless '' and unlikely to get the support of the United States and Europeans . The Russian text , obtained by Reuters , did not call for sanctions or other punitive measures , simply urging Syrian authorities to speed up their proposed reforms , and the opposition to engage in dialogue with the government . U.S. mission spokesman Mark Kornblau said the Security Council should respond to the Syrian government 's continuing violence . `` The draft resolution that we have put forward is the right basis for this response , '' he said . The council had scheduled an informal closed-door meeting of ambassadors on the draft sanctions resolution on Thursday afternoon , but the Chinese and Russian envoys boycotted the meeting , diplomats said . `` You see two permanent members of the Security Council who deliberately leave an empty chair , '' a diplomat said . `` We hope that they will engage constructively . '' Earlier this week , Churkin told reporters it was not the time to sanction Syria . After months of helping block any council action on Syria , Russia and China had backed an August 3 statement by the Security Council that condemned the government 's crackdown and called for it to end . Russia , China , Brazil , India and South Africa have repeatedly complained that the NATO intervention in Libya has gone far beyond the U.N. mandate approved by the council in March to protect civilians from violence by the government . They say they do not want the same thing to happen in Syria . Russia has long had close ties to Syria and is one of its main arms suppliers . One of the proposed sanctions is an arms embargo , which would make it illegal for Russian firms to sell weapons to Damascus . The sanctions would impose a travel ban on 22 of Assad 's relatives and associates and an asset freeze on 23 Syrians , including Assad . Envoys said Assad was excluded from the travel ban in order to give him an escape route . `` We want him to leave the country , '' a diplomat said . The United States and EU have urged Assad to step down . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Has Washington and western Europe lost their minds ? They think that after Libya 's destruction Russia , China and global community would allow this to happen to Syria . Just because these are smaller countries with out much influence , their being bossed around . How can anyone at UNSC vote for another sanction , after what happened to UN Resolution 1973 on Libya ?

Opposition figures and activists fear the successful use of force to topple Gaddafi may encourage Syrians to follow Libya 's example . Syrian protests have been mainly peaceful but there have been increasing reports of attacks on security forces . Upheaval in Syria would affect its allies and enemies in the volatile Middle East , and a softening in rhetoric from Arab countries this week indicated they might still be prepared to support President Bashar al-Assad if he implements reform . Following are some possible scenarios in Syria and the risks and opportunities they would present : The United Nations says 2,200 people have been killed in Assad 's crackdown on dissent since protests broke out in March . Syria says over 500 soldiers and police have been killed by armed groups which it blames for the violence . Despite growing international condemnation , Western sanctions , and escalating economic pressures from the unrest , Assad 's rule shows no sign of imminent collapse . Nor is there any indication that the protests across the country are about to stop , although the number of protesters appears to have fallen since Assad sent troops into several major cities earlier in August . If Assad can not crush the protests completely , he may be able to contain their impact , staying in power despite the major upheaval and economic disruption caused by the unrest and growing international isolation . STRIKING A DEAL WITH OPPOSITION Assad could reshuffle his ministers and bring in some opposition figures in a symbolic move that will not stop street demonstrations but may convince some that he is serious about reforms , including the promise of multi-party elections by February . After an apparently coordinated wave of criticism from regional powers including Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Turkey earlier this month , Arab states have moderated their language in recent days , hinting at a possible easing of pressure on Assad . Many opposition figures have dismissed Assad 's promise of political reform and said they can not talk to the authorities while the violence continues . But if the deadlock continues , some members of the fractured opposition may feel there is no alternative to negotiation , despite the chasm of mistrust between the two sides . So far no country has proposed carrying out in Syria the kind of intervention undertaken by NATO forces to help Libyan rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi . But the collapse of Gaddafi 's rule has encouraged some Syrian opposition figures and protesters to support international intervention in Syria , including the idea of a Turkish buffer zone in northern Syria . NATO help us , '' read one banner , in English , at a protest in the northern province of Idlib on Friday . But any military intervention could destabilize a region in which Assad enjoys strong support from Iran and backs militant groups like Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . `` Any negative or bad development will affect the whole region , '' Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Friday . International intervention could also lead some Syrians to choose Assad over perceived foreign interference . Analysts and some opposition activists have warned that the continuous killing may encourage people to take up arms in big numbers , pushing the country toward civil war . `` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein . Assad belongs to the minority Alawite sect which makes up around ten percent of the Syrian population . Most of the demonstrations are taking place in Sunni Muslim areas . There have been sectarian killings in some cities including Homs , but activists say so far it has been a minor part of the unrest . Syria suffered repeated coups in the 1960s before Assad 's father , Hafez al-Assad , seized power in 1970 and purged his opponents from positions of power . Despite reports of some low-level defections , and Assad 's replacement of his defense minister at the height of the military crackdown in August , the army has so far stood behind the president , unlike in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions . But some activists see little prospect of Assad being toppled by street demonstrations and see a military coup as the best chance of removing him . They hope Western calls for Assad to step down and targeted sanctions against senior officials might encourage those around the president to break away or carry out a coup to avoid prosecution . It is not clear how any new military leaders would deal with protesters ' demands for greater political freedoms . Attention has also focused on the wealthy merchant classes of Damascus and Aleppo which have made no public move yet to disassociate themselves from Assad . Unless they feel their interests would be protected in a post-Assad Syria , they would be reluctant to push for revolutionary change . But their patience may be tested as the economy reels from the collapse of tourism revenues and foreign investment , loss of trade and a fall in manufacturing output .

DE -RRB- expects further growth in its commodities business , including oil , its global head of the asset class told Reuters after cementing the bank among the biggest players in the last five years . David Silbert , a U.S. gas trader in the 1990s , who joined Deutsche in 2007 from Wall Street giant Merrill Lynch -LRB- BAC . N -RRB- , said he saw tight risk control and diversified portfolios in all commodities as crucial elements of strong performance . We are very disciplined around position management In the first quarter , we like most firms , did very well , '' the Deutsche Global Head of Commodities said from his office in the heart of the City of London 's financial district . `` I understand many did n't share our success in Q2 , however . The market gave us plenty of opportunity to take profit on Q1 risk and initiate new business from many different streams , '' Silbert said . Deutsche has said it had its best ever second quarter in commodities trading in April-June 2011 , helping offset an otherwise mixed performance in its fixed-income , credit and commodities division -LRB- FICC -RRB- . FICC posted revenues of 2.3 billion euros -LRB- $ 3.3 billion -RRB- , up 8 percent from last year but down 37 percent quarter-on-quarter . -LRB- ID : nN1E76P24G -RRB- Deutsche 's results came in sharp contrast to rivals including commodities trading heavyweights Goldman Sachs -LRB- GS . N -RRB- , Barclays -LRB- BARC . L -RRB- and Morgan Stanley -LRB- MS. N -RRB- , which reported relatively weak performances in commodities divisions in the second quarter -LRB- ID : nL6E7J228A -RRB- The second quarter was particularly volatile , as a more than $ 10 per barrel dive in oil prices on May 5 caught most players unprepared . Neither were many ready for an oil price plunge when Western nations released emergency stocks in June . What 's more , corn prices tumbled 23 percent in the second half of June , while silver crashed by 30 percent after briefly touching a record high in early May . `` Our model is not dependent on huge volatility or having huge directional moves , '' said Silbert , who added that the bank had made profit in commodities trading even on May 5 during the steep crash . Silbert said Deutsche has considerably grown in size since he joined from Merrill and by trading revenues the bank was now among the top three globally . Industry analysts and market participants estimate Goldman and Morgan hold the top spots by commodities trading revenues , followed by Deutsche , J.P. Morgan and Barclays . Silbert said one of the reasons behind the success was his team of experienced traders . It helps having leaders with long histories in the markets in which they operate , all of whom are veterans of volatility caused by extreme events . Five to 10 ten years does not make a veteran . Silbert said efforts by governments to impose greater regulatory oversight on the commodities trading business would lead to greater transparency but was unlikely to have a very large impact on the dynamics of trading . Risk taking in commodities may fall , but not because of regulations but because many have not deployed risk successfully as of late .

Noda , a former finance minister elected this week as Japan 's sixth prime minister in five years , tapped the 49-year-old Jun Azumi , a former parliamentary affairs chief , for the finance portfolio after his first choice turned it down . `` If he were a veteran lawmaker , the new finance minister might have clashed with Noda on some issues . But that appears not to be the case and the choice is likely a sign Noda will pursue his own policies on economic and fiscal issues , '' said Koichi Haji , chief economist at NLI Research Institute . Noda , an unassuming conservative who has compared himself to the `` dojo '' loach , a bottom-feeding fish , faces a long list of challenges as the third premier since his Democratic Party of Japan -LRB- DPJ -RRB- took power in 2009 . Among them : dragging the world 's third-largest economy out of stagnation , forging a new energy policy while ending a radiation crisis at a crippled nuclear plant , rebuilding the tsunami-devastated northeast and finding funds to pay for that and the vast costs of social welfare in an aging society . He must also navigate a divided parliament where the opposition controls the upper house and can block bills , while trying to smooth over rifts within the DPJ , which has never delivered on promises to change how the country is governed . `` As with the ` loach ' , we will sweat , get covered with mud but get the work done and push politics forward , '' new Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told a news conference after announcing the cabinet line-up . New Finance Minister Azumi , who hails from the tsunami-hit town of Ishinomaki in northeast Japan , led the Democrats ' campaign in an upper house election in 2010 that they lost badly , handing opposition parties a majority . The former NHK public TV announcer served previously as vice defense minister but little is known about his views on fiscal policy . His first task will be to oversee drafting of a third extra budget to fund reconstruction from the March disasters , the biggest rebuilding project since right after World War Two . The finance portfolio is probably the toughest cabinet job as the minister has to try to contain ballooning debt while seeking to stimulate growth . The turnover at the helm of the ministry has exceeded even that in the top government post and the new minister will be Japan 's ninth since 2006 . Some analysts questioned whether Azumi was up to the task . `` He 's too lightweight , '' said Katsuhiko Nakamura , executive director at the Asian Forum Japan think tank . Noda settled on Azumi after his first choice , former DPJ secretary general Katsuya Okada , declined . There were no standout appointments in the new cabinet , which -- like Noda 's earlier picks for party posts -- included a mix of lawmakers from various groups in the party , divided by policy gaps and personal feuds . That led some to critics to wonder whether Noda was putting too much stress on party unity over expertise . `` I do n't think this line-up is one that can pull up its socks and respond to the public 's hopes , '' Nakamura said . Others said bureaucrats were anyway likely to be playing a bigger role in policy than under Noda 's two DPJ predecessors . `` We need someone who can get from A to B to C in a very effective manner and bureaucrats are very good at that , '' said Jesper Koll , director of equities research at JPMorgan in Tokyo . As trade minister , Noda appointed Yoshio Hachiro , a former parliamentary affairs chief who once belonged to the leftist Social Democratic Party . He will play a key role as Japan works out a national energy policy in the wake of the world 's worst atomic crisis in 25 years at the tsunami-hit Fukushima plant . Noda has distanced himself from his predecessor Naoto Kan 's harsher anti-nuclear stance , but acknowledges that building new reactors will be impossible given public safety concerns . Motohisa Furukawa , 45 , a former deputy chief cabinet secretary , takes over as national strategy and economics minister while Koichiro Gemba , 47 , a former national strategy minister , becomes foreign minister . Gemba must work to tighten ties with security ally the United States , which frayed after the DPJ swept to power , while trying to maintain relations with China -- often strained by present rivalries and disputes over their wartime past .

Arbil lies in the heart of the semi-autonomous Kurdish area , a safe haven for Iraqis seeking fun and a break from the almost daily attacks that still hit most of the country more than eight years after the U.S.-led invasion . The province 's capital city , also called Arbil , boasts a top designer-label shopping experience in one of its many malls and is home to the Citadel , one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world . `` It 's like an independent Iraq , '' said Ahmed , who lives in Tikrit , the home town of former dictator Saddam Hussein who was toppled by the 2003 invasion . `` Other parts of Iraq have no electricity , no water . Just bombs , '' she added , while sitting with her husband and daughter at the foot of the Citadel , enjoying a cool spray from one of the many lit-up fountains dotted around the area . Her 14-year-old daughter , Rasan , agrees . `` It 's much better here . We are more free , we can walk , go anywhere . In Tikrit , my day involves going from school to home , studying and then sleeping , '' she said . `` Here I like to shop and go to the amusement park . '' The Kurdish region has been virtually autonomous for 20 years and was little affected by the country 's most recent war . Foreign investment has been steady , allowing for the development of chic shopping malls , five-star hotels , fitness centres and even an indoor ice-skating rink . Over the 3-day Eid al-Fitr festival last week , 152,000 people visited the Kurdish region , of which 99,000 went to the province of Arbil , according to Mawlawi Jabbar , director general of tourism in Iraqi Kurdistan . Jabbar said 143,000 of the 152,000 were Iraqis from other parts of the country while 9,000 came from Iran or Turkey . `` The capacity of hotels and motels in Kurdistan is about 50,000 beds . Due to the heavy flow , we had an unprecedented number of visitors who were processed and accommodated in tourist camps set up in Shaqlawa , north of Arbil , and in Arbil itself , '' he said . BLEND OF OLD VERSUS NEW One of Arbil 's main appeals for war-weary Iraqis is security . The city last witnessed a bombing in May 2007 and is a far cry from the blast walls and checkpoints scattered around Iraq 's capital , Baghdad . Iraq is still building its police and army to battle a Sunni Islamist insurgency and Shi'ite militias as U.S. forces get ready to leave by end-December . The Kurdish zone also has peshmerga security forces . The mountainous borders of Kurdistan have recently been the target of air strikes from Turkey and shelling from Iran , both aimed at Kurdish guerrillas in the area fighting for a separate Kurdish state . But Arbil , a few hours drive away from the border , has not been affected by the assaults . Arbil 's blend of old meets new , from its mosques to a fun park with a roller coaster and a carousel , appeal to both the young and the old . `` We came here for pleasure , '' said Shaheen Ahmed Khalid , an assistant medic from Kirkuk who brought his family to Arbil to celebrate Eid . `` Arbil is safer and it 's better for tourism . There 's more to do . '' Some Iraqis said regional turmoil had also prompted them to change their travel plans to neighbouring countries . A wave of pro-democracy protests across parts of the Middle East and North Africa this year sparked a civil war in Libya and a violent crackdown by Syria 's government has killed 2,000 people , the United Nations says . `` Sometimes we go to Turkey and to Syria , but in Syria there is bad security , so we changed . Instead of going to Syria , we came here , '' said Aziz Abbas , a 50-year-old Higher Education ministry employee from Samarra who was visiting Arbil . Iraq itself has not been immune to protests . Demonstrators took to the streets earlier this year over jobs and poor services . Rallies in Sulaimaniya by protesters who said they were seeking an end to corruption and authoritarian rule were met by a big show of force by the Kurdistan Regional Government . Protests in Arbil were small . "}, {"uid": "270", "dct": "2011-09-07", "dates": [null, null], "text": "An elevated view shows the financial district of the City of London April 12 , 2011 . LONDON | Wed Sep 7 , 2011 2:13 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The government 's plans to shield taxpayers from the risk of possible future failures by high street banks will trigger a costly and fundamental rewriting of lenders ' so-called `` living wills . '' Formally known as recovery and resolution plans -LRB- RRP -RRB- , the wills - also known as `` death plans '' - detail how a bank will survive a crisis , such as which assets or businesses would be sold off to improve capital . They also spell out how the bank would be wound up speedily without destabilising the broader financial system if it proves impossible to save . The Independent Commission on Banking -LRB- ICB -RRB- is expected to confirm that domestic banks must `` ringfence '' deposits with a bespoke capital cushion so that accounts are still safe if a bank gets into difficulties . Its final recommendations due on September 12 will force a major reworking of living wills as they will effectively split lenders into a deposit taking arm separate from a unit for riskier , investment banking activities . `` If you take one of the large universal banks , at the moment their living wills will be predicated on them being one institution , '' said Peter Snowdon , a regulatory lawyer at Norton Rose . `` Once they are two institutions , they have to have two living wills . It 's like a living will for suicide , '' Snowdon said . The betting among lawyers is that even if the effective date of the ICB-led changes is pushed back to 2015 or later , UK regulators will pressure banks to rewrite living wills sooner rather than later to make them workable . Michael McKee , a financial partner at DLA Piper , said the ICB will say little about living wills but its recommendations will force banks to reorganise their structures . `` They will then have to modify their resolution plans to fit the new structures created , '' McKee said . It wo n't be cheap , though costings are hard to come by . `` This amounts to a huge job : given the length of time to generate one of these things and amount of resources , there will be armies of consultants and lawyers lining up , '' said Bob Penn , a partner at Allen & Overy lawfirm . `` The outcome of it for a big clearing bank is going to be a document that runs into thousands or even tens of thousands of pages , '' Penn said . The government spent over a trillion pounds to shore up its banking sector and buy stakes in or nationalise lenders such as Northern Rock , Royal Bank of Scotland -LRB- RBS . L -RRB- and Lloyds -LRB- LLOY . L -RRB- in the fallout from the financial crisis . This galvanised the UK Financial Services Authority to pioneer living wills well ahead of a global initiative which world leaders are expected to endorse in November . The FSA has already forced six banks , including Barclays -LRB- BARC . L -RRB- , HSBC -LRB- HSBA . L -RRB- , Lloyds and RBS , to submit living wills under a UK pilot program . `` The very important but largely unsung recovery and resolution plans , better known by the distasteful term ` living wills ' , are nearly complete in the UK banks , '' British Bankers ' Association Chief Executive Angela Knight said in a blog last month . The changes that will be wrought by the ICB 's ringfencing will be of a different scale to the tweaks that could be anticipated from the pilot program , lawyers working for banks say . `` Using living wills to effect structural change is like operating with a scalpel while the ICB has been asked to wield an axe - cleaving banks into two without regard for the risks they pose individually , '' Penn said . Living wills will also have to be updated each time a bank makes any major changes to its business model and the whole process will be time consuming for senior management . `` The tentacles stretch out through the whole business . You ca n't get the tea lady to do it because it 's something the regulators will crawl over , '' Snowdon said . The new structures created by the ICB recommendations , coupled with regulation from the European Union and global bodies to beef up bank capital and liquidity , will spark a fundamental rethink of banking business models . `` The ICB is part of a much broader structural debate for banks as boards ask what are we going to look like in five years ' time , '' Penn said .

WASHINGTON | Fri Sep 9 , 2011 9:48 am BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama 's jobs package could lift U.S. economic growth by one to three percentage points in 2012 , add well over one million jobs and lower the unemployment rate by at least half a percentage point , judging by early estimates . It might not exactly deliver the `` jolt '' Obama claimed in his speech to Congress Thursday night , but it would be enough to make a difference . The basic idea is to give a sufficient boost to get the stalled recovery over the hump where households , banks and businesses have paid down more of their debt loads and regained the confidence to start spending , lending and hiring again . Once demand picks up , the private sector will kick in and begin hiring , and the fiscal props can fall away . It would deliver the economic medicine prescribed in recent weeks by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the International Monetary Fund to prevent a worrisome slowdown in global economic growth from turning into recession . U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also can assure his fellow finance officials at the G7 meeting of top industrial nations in Marseilles on Friday the United States is pulling its weight . The wild card of course is whether a Republican-dominated U.S. House of Representatives will agree to the full $ 447 billion -LRB- 280 billion pounds -RRB- package , an unlikely prospect given their criticism that the $ 830 billion stimulus program of February 2009 failed to deliver lift-off for the U.S. economy and added to the huge U.S. budget deficit . The U.S. economy is so scarred by the 2007 housing credit implosion , the bank failures it triggered in 2008 and the deepest recession in 70 years that it is taking a very long time to recover and create jobs . `` What you come down to is that there is no silver bullet , no magic bullet that this president or anyone can propose that would drive unemployment down to 5 percent in the next year , '' said Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers , an economic modeling firm in St. Louis . `` It has to come from the private sector and for that you have to work through the overhang from the housing crisis that is suppressing aggregate demand , '' he said . This suggests that Obama 's jobs program most likely would serve as a palliative , not a cure , leaving room for the Federal Reserve to provide further monetary stimulus to keep the economy from slipping back into recession . Analysts at Capital Economics estimated that Obama 's plan is equivalent to 3 percent of U.S. GDP and should be enough to add significantly to 2012 growth if passed in full by Congress . The biggest single boost could come from a $ 250 billion reduction in payroll taxes . Obama proposes extending an existing 2 percent cut in the payroll tax and increasing its size to 3.1 percent for workers , and adding a cut for employers . `` These payroll tax reductions are the proposals that have the greatest chance of getting passed by Congress because it will be harder for Republicans to vote against proposed tax cuts , '' said Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics . The tax cuts could add as much as $ 375 billion to economic output to the $ 14 trillion U.S. economy , based upon Congressional Budget Office estimates in August of the economic impact that fiscal stimulus programs can have on GDP . But not all of that would be fresh stimulus money , since a $ 112 billion payroll tax cut is already in place and would simply be extended . Additionally , the full impact would be lessened because it does not target lower income workers . `` It gives money disproportionately to people at the top of the income scale . Higher income individuals are more likely to save the money , they do n't need to spend it on essentials , so the effective impact is lessened , '' said Roberton Williams , senior fellow at the centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center . Still Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that the 2 percent payroll tax cut extension alone would add 400,000 jobs and boost GDP in 2012 by 0.5 percent . The larger sum might increase that to roughly 0.7 percent GDP and 600,000 jobs . The second biggest element in Obama 's plan is the $ 105 billion in infrastructure investment , which could add as much as $ 262 billion to the economy , based on the CBO figures . Macroeconomic Advisers estimates that could create about 150,000 new jobs in the first year and add over half a million jobs over three years -- good news but small for an economy that usually generates over two million jobs a year when in good health . The challenge also would be to find `` shovel-ready '' projects where highways , railroads or school renovation plans are on the drawing board awaiting funding . Otherwise it can take years to get major construction projects under way . Extending unemployment benefits , which total $ 49 billion in Obama 's plan , also has a significant impact . It could add up to $ 102 billion to the economy . Macroeconomic Advisers estimates it would add 0.25 percent to GDP growth in 2012 and create 200,000 new jobs by putting extra cash in consumers ' pockets . Economists were re-running computer models late on Thursday to update their figures . Based on a smaller $ 300 billion stimulus package that Obama unveiled , Ian Shepherdson , U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics , had estimated a 1.3 percent boost to GDP and 1.7 million jobs over the life of the programs . Their initial reaction was if it were adopted in full , which is quite unlikely , the plan would lower the 9.1 percent unemployment rate closer to 8 percent in 2012 and give a welcome boost to an economy that grew at a 1 percent annual rate in the second quarter . But it is does not guarantee solid recovery . `` Is this going to be more than a panacea for our problems ? It is hard to tell , '' said Williams . `` This downturn has been deeper and longer than anything we have seen since the 1930s and we do n't fully understand it . What we do know is that what we did in 2009 was not big enough .

In Hajar al-Aswad , on the southern edge of Damascus , protesters carried a large green , white and red-striped old Syrian flag , dating back half a century to the era before Assad 's Baath Party seized control of Syria . `` After all these killings and assaults , where is international protection ? '' read a banner carried by protesters who chanted : `` The people want the execution of the president . '' Assad has responded to the protests , inspired by Arab popular uprisings that have toppled three autocratic leaders in North Africa this year , with military assaults in which the United Nations says 2,200 people have died . A Syrian grassroots organization said security forces have killed 3,000 civilians . The killings on Friday occurred in the city of Homs , 165-km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- north of Damascus , in the tribal province of Deir al-Zor and in the northwestern province of Idlib near Turkey -- regions that have seen raids in the last several weeks by tank-backed troops and militiamen loyal to Assad . The death toll was lower than many previous Fridays . `` It seems that the regime eased its assaults a bit today after hearing the words of Turkey and to look better ahead of the Arab League visit , '' said one activist in the city of Hama , which saw some of the heaviest military assaults . `` But this is for public consumption . We have been seeing a spike in the assassinations of street leaders , arrests , torture and deaths in prison , '' said the activist , who did not want to be named for fear of being apprehended . Syrian authorities do not comment on arrests or suspected torture but have said in the past that any arrests are made in accordance with the constitution . The Arab League said that its secretary-general , Nabil Elaraby , will visit Syria on Saturday and Arab foreign ministers will meet next week to convey concerns . Arab states led by Saudi Arabia have called on Assad to halt the violence . Syria 's powerful neighbor Turkey indicated that its patience was running thin given the lack of progress in its efforts to convince Assad to halt military assaults . `` Mr Assad , how can you say you are killing terrorists when you were actually shelling Latakia from the sea and hitting civilian targets ? '' Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on al-Jazeera Television in an interview broadcast on Thursday . `` We are moving patiently now . But after consultations , we will give our final word , which will show an exit from the tunnel , because we are not the ones who put Assad on this dead-end road . It was he and those around him who entered this dead-end road . '' Western countries have imposed limited economic sanctions on Syria but have not seriously considered direct intervention along the lines of the NATO bombing of Libya that helped topple its leader Muammar Gaddafi . `` The Syrian people demand international protection for civilians , '' read a banner in Idlib . On Thursday the Syrian opposition issued its first direct call for foreign intervention . The Syrian Revolution General Commission , an umbrella bloc of activists , appealed to world powers to send human rights monitors . Syrian forces arrested dozens of people in house-to-house raids in Homs on Thursday after military operations that killed at least 27 civilians on Wednesday . Activists and residents also reported more defections among the rank-and-file army . Human Rights Watch said security forces `` forcibly removed 18 wounded people '' from a hospital in Homs on Wednesday , and also prevented medical personnel from reaching wounded people . The European Union , which banned imports of Syrian crude oil last week , moved closer on Friday to banning investment in the oil industry , EU diplomats said . Syria is only a small oil producer but nearly all of its exports last year were bought by Europe and European oil firms have investments there . However , there has been no hint in the West of an appetite for military action along Libyan lines . Syria has three times Libya 's population , and unlike isolated Libya it is intricately linked to neighbors on the fault lines of Mid-East conflicts . Syria has long had a strong regional alliance with Iran , but in an unusual sign of unease Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged Assad to open talks with the opposition , saying a military crackdown is `` never the right solution . '' Iran crushed its own anti-government street protests in 2009 after Ahmadinejad 's contested re-election . The Syrian military launched offensives against the cities of Latakia , Aleppo and Deir al-Zor last month . The authorities say they are fighting a foreign conspiracy to divide Syria and blame `` armed terrorist groups '' for the bloodshed , and for killing 500 members of the army and police . In Idlib province near the border with Turkey , at least three army defectors were killed by the military as it raided the Jabal al-Zawiya area in pursuit of deserters . Activists reported a similar operation in Qusair near the Lebanese border against defectors on Friday . Assad , the ruling hierarchy and most of the army officer corps are from the minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . The majority of Syrians , including most rank-and-file soldiers , are Sunni Muslims . Russia , which has blocked a U.N. measure to censure Syria , hinted that it is ready to discuss a possible U.N. Security Council resolution but will support a document only if it targets the opposition as well as the authorities for censure . Syrian opposition figures met officials in Moscow on Friday , urging Russia to do more to support protesters . `` The incomprehensible and contradictory position of the Russian leadership on what is happening in Syria could hurt Russia 's image in the future , '' said dissident Ammar al-Qurabi .

Washington , which has poured billions of dollars in military aid into Egypt since it made peace with Israel in 1979 , urged Cairo to protect the mission after protesters hurled embassy documents from the windows of the building and removed and burnt the Israeli flag . Three people died and 1,049 were wounded in the clashes that began Friday and raged on into the early hours of Saturday around the Cairo tower block housing the embassy , the Health Ministry said . Police and soldiers fired shots in the air and tear gas to disperse the crowd , which replied with stones . Egypt 's army , under pressure to hand power back to civilians after taking over from toppled president Hosni Mubarak , must balance public calls for a more assertive policy towards Israel with maintaining ties that bring it cash and U.S. military hardware . `` Egypt witnessed a harsh day that inflicted pain and worry on all Egyptians . It is clear that the behavior of some threatens the Egyptian revolution , '' Information Minister Osama Hassan Heikal said in a televised statement . Egypt would transfer those in custody or `` involved in inciting or participating in -LRB- Friday 's -RRB- events to the emergency state security court , '' the minister said . Justice Minister Mohamed Abdel Aziz el-Guindy told state television the government had decided to apply emergency laws still in place `` forcefully '' and that trials would be swift . Protesters burnt tyres in the street and at least two police vehicles were set alight near the embassy . Many had come from a demonstration in central Cairo organised to push the army to end emergency law and speed up political reforms . `` Our dignity has been restored , '' said Mohi Alaa , 24 , a protester near the site of the overnight clashes . Bits of concrete and bullet casings were strewn over the street . `` We do n't want the Americans ' money , '' he said , reflecting the greater readiness of many Egyptians to express resentment of Israel and the United States after decades of pragmatic official relations . Some 500 protesters stayed after dawn and a few threw stones at police , who gradually pushed them away and secured the area around the embassy , located on the upper floors of a residential block overlooking the Nile . It was the second big eruption of violence at the embassy since five Egyptian border guards were killed last month when Israel repelled cross-border raiders it said were Palestinians . Egypt then briefly threatened to withdraw its envoy to Israel . Israel has stopped short of apologising , saying it is still investigating the Egyptian deaths , which occurred during an operation against gunmen who had killed eight Israelis . Israeli ambassador Yitzhak Levanon , staff and family members arrived home Saturday , but one diplomat stayed in Egypt to maintain the embassy , an Israeli official said . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would preserve its 1979 peace with Egypt despite the incident . `` We are working together with the Egyptian government to return our ambassador to Cairo soon , '' he said in televised remarks . `` I would like to ensure that the security arrangements necessary for him and for our staff will be steadfast . '' The Egyptian information minister 's statement followed a crisis meeting of his key cabinet members and talks with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , who heads the military council that has ruled Egypt since Mubarak stepped down on February 11 . State television said the military council rejected an offer by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf to resign . Israel is finding itself increasingly at odds with formerly sympathetic states in the region . It is embroiled in a feud with Turkey , once the closest of its few Muslim allies , over an Israeli raid last year that killed nine Turks on a flotilla bound for Gaza . Egypt 's ties with Israel , though never warm , were a pillar of Mubarak 's foreign policy and buttressed his claim to be a regional mediator . Under Mubarak , displays of hostility to Israel were crushed by force . U.S. President Barack Obama called on Egypt to `` honor its international obligations '' and protect the Israeli mission . He told Israel 's Netanyahu that Washington was taking steps to resolve the situation . The State Department said Washington had been in contact with Egyptian and Israeli officials over the violence . `` Israel and Egypt are key partners and allies of the United States , and both states have made clear their continuing commitment to maintain their bilateral relationship and the peace treaty between them , which remains a cornerstone of regional stability , '' Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said . Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr said Cairo was committed to `` fully respect all its international obligations regarding protecting and safeguarding international diplomatic missions on its soil , '' the state MENA news agency said . An Israeli official said the ambassador , staff and family members had left in one plane and a second one had brought home six Israeli security personnel who had been left guarding the embassy , protected from the crowd only by a reinforced door until Egyptian troops extracted them . British Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the embassy attack and urged Egypt to protect diplomatic property . Some Egyptian politicians and activists criticised the violence , even if they backed the anti-Israel demonstration . Presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahy called for the army to take a `` serious stance matching the public anger '' towards Israel but said violence sullied the image of Egypt 's uprising . Last month , a man scaled the embassy building , took down Israel 's flag and replaced it with Egypt 's . Protests continued daily but did not turn violent until the latest flare-up . In response to the protests , the authorities had erected a wall around the building , which was quickly defaced with anti-Israel slogans and then painted in Egypt 's national colors . Friday , the wall was torn down . -LRB- Reporting by Yasmine Saleh , Mohamed Abdellah , Seham Eloraby , Ahmed Tolba and Sami Aboudi in Cairo , Dan Williams in Jerusalem , and Christopher Wilson and Timothy Gardner in Washington ; Writing by Edmund Blair ; Editing by Janet Lawrence -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

After talks in Damascus with Assad , Elaraby said he would present the proposed measures to Arab foreign ministers who are due to discuss Syria 's five-month uprising against the Syrian president and his military assault on protesters . `` I focused on the importance of an open national dialogue that encompasses all personalities on the basis of national reconciliation , in which the Arab League plays a main role , '' Elaraby told journalists on his return to Egypt from Syria . He did not give details . The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five people had been killed in the Bab Amro district of Homs during a sweep by troops and security forces , shortly before the Arab League secretary-general held talks with Assad . A 45-year-old man was shot dead by security forces at a checkpoint in the northern province of Idlib , it added . Assad has responded to the wave of street protests , inspired by Arab uprisings that have overthrown three North African leaders , with a mix of repression and promises of reform that protesters have dismissed as too little too late . `` I asserted to President Assad that the starting point is the need for reforms to emerge from the current crisis which Syria is passing through , '' Elaraby said . Foreign ministers of the 22-member Arab League told Syria two weeks ago to work to end the violence `` and resort to reason before it 's too late . '' They will meet again to discuss Syria on September 13 . The Cairo-based organization has been under pressure to speak out more openly following the uprisings that ousted leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and led to the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi -- achieved with NATO air intervention endorsed by the Arab League . The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on Syria , and regional powers have grown increasingly critical of Assad , but no country has proposed the kind of international military action that helped bring down Gaddafi . Authorities in Damascus blame armed groups for the violence and say 500 soldiers and police have been killed since the unrest erupted in the southern city of Deraa in mid-March . The United Nations says 2,200 people have died in the uprising , while a Syrian grassroots organization says security forces have killed 3,000 civilians . Syria has barred most independent media , making it hard to verify accounts by activists and authorities . Activists said six people were killed during protests after midday prayers on Friday . In a change to their demands , demonstrators called for international protection to stop civilian killings in what has become one of the most violent responses to the Arab uprisings that have swept the Middle East and North Africa . Their calls were echoed on Saturday at a meeting in Vienna of Syrian expatriates which brought together 30 representatives of Syrian civil associations in 15 European countries . `` After the events in Syria ... we are distancing ourselves from the Syrian regime and declaring it illegitimate . Our further goal is to support the Syrian revolution and the opposition , '' said Amer Alkhatib , who described himself as spokesman for the Syrian community in Austria . Alkhatib said the group was collecting money to support the families of victims and lobbying host governments to take a hard line on the Assad government . It was also seeking a United Nations commitment to protect civilians , though it was not calling for foreign military intervention on the ground .

THESSALONIKI , Greece | Sat Sep 10 , 2011 10:24 pm BST THESSALONIKI , Greece -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Saturday he would do whatever it takes to rescue his country from bankruptcy and stay in the euro zone , as doubts in Europe grew over its membership in the bloc . Sending a message to international lenders increasingly frustrated with delays in reforms and missed fiscal targets , Papandreou said his government was determined to take the difficult decisions and make the sacrifices needed . `` We decided to fight the battle to avoid a disaster for the country and its people and to stay in the euro , '' he said in his annual economic speech at a trade fair in the northern city of Thessaloniki . `` Any delay and wavering is dangerous for the country . '' Anger at the country 's failure to meet fiscal targets under its EU\\/IMF bailout has reached boiling point , prompting senior euro zone policymakers to cast doubt on its ability to avoid default or even its membership in the single currency . The embattled premier , who was heckled by angry labor unions on Friday , said he would redouble efforts to fight endemic tax evasion , a main hurdle in achieving fiscal targets . His Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said earlier Greece may even take additional fiscal measures in 2011 to make up for budget deficit slippage that threatens the disbursement of an 8 billion euro EU\\/IMF loan tranche . Venizelos pledged to further cut the civil service payroll , push privatisations and deepen labor market reforms . Civil servants , who have seen about a fifth of their wages slashed , will suffer more after the government decided to put thousands of them in a so-called `` Labor Reserve , '' in which they will draw 60 percent of their salary and possibly face dismissal if they find no other public sector job within a year . But austerity measures are throwing the economy into an ever deeper recession . GDP will shrink by more than 5 percent this year , Venizelos said , topping earlier projections in its third straight year of contraction . More than 20,000 protesters gathered in the northern city to mark Papandreou 's speech . Police fired tear gas at youths smashing shop windows and setting fires on the main shopping streets . Police said 106 people were detained . Demonstrations were organised by civil servants , students , taxi drivers and even football fans . Some restaurants in the city shut down to protest a VAT hike that took effect earlier this month . `` We are suffering an unprecedented tax raid ... we deeply worry about tomorrow , '' George Kasimatis , chairman of Greece 's Chamber of Commerce Federation , told Venizelos during the conference . About 7,000 police were patrolling the city 's streets , cordoning off the fairgrounds . Ministers canceled plans for their usual walkabouts in the city and Papandreou avoided touring the fair in the morning , as prime ministers traditionally do on the event 's first day . While vowing to keep its side of the bargain , the Greek government sharply criticised its EU partners for delaying ratification of a second , 109-billion-euro bailout for the country , agreed by euro zone leaders on July 21 . `` Europe must rise to the challenge and move towards implementing the July 21 decisions , to put an end to the Sisyphean ordeal the Greek people is going through , '' said Development Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis . `` Doing nothing is disastrous for all of us , '' he added . A G7 source said the troika -LRB- EU\\/IMF\\/ECB -RRB- , which suspended talks with Athens last week in frustration at Greece 's struggle to stick to its deficit reduction plan , would probably come up with a form of words in its next report to allow the next tranche of bailout funds to be paid . But the working assumption is that Greece will not avoid default indefinitely . However , a bond swap plan for private bondholders , which is part of the second bailout plan and is supposed to ease Greece 's debt payments was progressing well , Venizelos said . `` The private sector is responding very well to the PSI -LRB- private sector involvement -RRB- , '' he said , without elaborating , one day after an initial deadline for banks to express interest in the scheme expired .

A day after France described the lack of a firm U.N. stance against Damascus as a scandal , President Dmitry Medvedev said recent U.S. and European sanctions on Syria meant `` additional pressure now is absolutely not needed in this direction . '' Russia and China , veto-wielding members of the United Nations Security Council , have resisted efforts by Washington and its European allies to step up the international response to Syria 's repression of nearly six months of protests . Assad has reacted to the uprising , inspired by revolts which have toppled three North African leaders this year , with military assaults on protest centers and mass arrests . On Monday , residents and local activists said Syrian forces killed at least 15 villagers in raids in the countryside around Hama in what they said was one of the biggest military assaults since the uprising broke out . At least 2,000 troops backed by dozens of armored vehicles fired machineguns at random and stormed several villages and towns in the al-Ghab Plain , agricultural land northwest of Hama , they said . Residents and activists had reported earlier that several thousand soldiers and hundreds of armored vehicles had massed in the last 24 hours in areas north of Hama which had seen large protests calling for Assad 's removal . Syrian opposition group Sawasiah said on Sunday 113 civilians had been killed in the last week , during which activists and diplomats say Syrian forces stepped up raids to detain protest coordinators . Damascus blames armed groups for the violence . Assad 's media adviser Bouthaina Shaaban , speaking on a trip to Moscow on Monday , gave a lower death toll than the United Nations and said half of the fatalities were among security forces . `` According to our information , 700 people were killed on the side of the army and police and 700 on the side of the insurgents , '' Shaaban told reporters through a translator . U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the United Nations figure was based on `` reliable sources on the ground . '' `` The number of those killed since the onset of the unrest in mid-March ... has now reached at least 2,600 , '' Pillay told the U.N. Human Rights Council . She did not identify the sources . Syria has barred Pillay 's investigation team and most foreign journalists from entering the country . Syria had also repeatedly blocked U.N. efforts to get human rights monitors into the country , U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Valerie Amos said . The United Nations on Monday named a three-member panel of international experts to investigate human rights violations including possible crimes against humanity since the protests began . Sergio Pinheiro of Brazil will lead the commission of inquiry , which the U.N. Human Rights Council agreed to set up last month to probe arbitrary executions , excessive use of force and killings and report back by the end of November . FRANCE WANTS `` CLEAR UN RESOLUTION '' France , Britain , the United States , Germany and Portugal have circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that called for sanctions against Assad , influential relatives and close associates , but it met resistance from Russia and China . `` I think it 's a scandal not to have a clear position of the U.N. in such a terrible crisis , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Sunday . `` We think that the regime has lost its legitimacy . We think that it 's too late to implement a level of reform . We should adopt in New York a very clear resolution condemning the violence . '' Medvedev said Russia believed any resolution must be `` tough but balanced , and addressed to both sides in Syria , '' and that it must not automatically lead to further sanctions because `` there is already a large number of sanctions against Syria . '' Syrian demonstrators have demanded international protection to stop civilian killings , but there has been no hint in the West of any appetite for military action along the lines of the NATO bombing that helped topple Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi . Intervention would be a daunting prospect in a country in the heart of the volatile Middle East . Syria has three times Libya 's population , supports Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups and has a strong alliance with Iran . It remains formally at war with Israel , retains influence in Lebanon and has a sizeable Kurdish minority in its east . After talks in Damascus with Assad , Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said they had agreed on a series of measures that he would present to league member states to help end the violence . Assad has announced some reforms such as ending emergency law and launching a `` national dialogue . '' Opponents say these have made little difference . Among hundreds of Syrians arrested in recent days was leading psychoanalyst Rafah Nashed , 66 , who has been treating people traumatized by the mounting repression , her friends said .

A Syrian-based television station said it would soon broadcast another message from the fugitive Gaddafi , who has issued regular battle calls to his followers in the three weeks since Tripoli was overrun . The new ruling National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- says that as long as Gaddafi remains on the run he is capable of attracting followers to a dangerous insurgency . Witnesses to the refinery attack said the assailants damaged the front gate of the facility , 20 km -LRB- 13 miles -RRB- from the coastal town of Ras Lanuf , but not the plant itself , which is not fully operational . About 60 staff were there at the time of the attack , according to one of two wounded survivors at a hospital where the dead were also taken . Refinery worker Ramadan Abdel Qader , who had been shot in the foot , told Reuters that gunmen in 14 or 15 trucks had come from the direction of the Gaddafi-held coastal city of Sirte . `` We heard firing and shelling at around 9 in the morning from Gaddafi loyalists , '' he said . Staff had been asleep . The assault occurred only hours after the NTC announced it had resumed some oil production , which had been all but halted since anti-Gaddafi protests turned into civil war in March . The interim council is struggling to assert its control over the entire country and capture a handful of stubbornly defended pro-Gaddafi towns . Many senior NTC officials also see scooping up Gaddafi and the members of his family who are still on the run as crucial to finally declaring victory in the seven-month old war . Gaddafi 's son Saadi arrived in neighbouring Niger on Sunday after crossing the remote Sahara desert frontier . On Monday the U.S. State Department said that the government of Niger had confirmed to it that it intended to detain the former soccer player . But a Nigerien government spokesman told Reuters that Saadi Gaddafi was only being watched for now . `` Nothing has changed in the government 's position . There is no international search for him . Like the others he is just under surveillance , '' the spokesman said , referring to other Gaddadfi loyalists who have recently fled to Niger . Two other sons and Gaddafi 's only biological daughter have fled to Algeria . One son is reported to have died in the war and three others are still on the run . The NTC has said it will send a delegation to Niger to seek the return of anyone wanted for crimes . Niger , like Algeria , has cited humanitarian reasons for accepting fugitives of the former government , but has promised to respect its commitments to the International Criminal Court , which wants to try Gaddafi , son Saif al-Islam and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi for war crimes . NTC forces , which seized Tripoli on August 23 , said they were meeting fierce resistance on the fourth day of fighting for the Gaddafi-held desert town of Bani Walid , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of the capital , and were edging towards Sirte . Libya 's economy is almost entirely dependent on oil , and restarting production is crucial to restoring the economy . Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said on Sunday some oil production had resumed , but would not say where or how much . Libya holds Africa 's largest crude oil reserves and sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe under Gaddafi . Western oil firms , including Italy 's Eni and Austria 's OMV , are keen to restore production . Eni 's chief executive told Reuters his priority was to restart gas exports via a pipeline from Libya to Italy by October or November . Resuming oil output was less urgent . `` We are by far the biggest player in Libya , both in oil and in gas , so I came here with the idea of ` back to normal ' , '' Paolo Scaroni said during a visit to Tripoli . In Bani Walid , fleeing residents reported intense street fighting while NATO warplanes could be heard overhead . Families trapped there for weeks escaped after Gaddafi forces abandoned some checkpoints on the outskirts . Dozens of cars packed with civilians streamed out of the area . `` We are leaving because of the rockets . They are falling near civilian homes , '' said one resident , Ali Hussain . The United Nations says it is worried about the fate of civilians trapped inside besieged pro-Gaddafi towns . `` Our big concern right now is Sirte , where we are receiving reports that there 's no water and no electricity , '' U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told Reuters in Dubai . The NTC has sent extra units to Bani Walid , but some fighters said this only worsened tribal tensions between fighters from other areas and those from the town . `` Our fighters are from all over Libya . There was little control over them yesterday . Today we will control them better , '' said NTC commander Mohamed el-Fassi . He said five NTC fighters were killed and 14 wounded in Sunday 's clashes . Some NTC combatants said they suspected local fighters of the Warfalla tribe , Libya 's largest , of passing tips to Gaddafi forces in Bani Walid . `` We believe there are traitors among them , '' said Mohammed el Gahdi , from the coastal city of Khoms . NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters the plan for Bani Walid for now was to wait . `` When our forces entered Bani Walid they found the brigades of Gaddafi using citizens as shields , '' he said , adding that missile launchers had been placed on the roofs of homes , making it impossible for NTC forces or NATO warplanes to strike .

Full Article Turkish PM says concerned about Syria civil war CAIRO | Tue Sep 13 , 2011 1:47 pm IST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said he was concerned Syria could slip into civil war and that he wanted to deepen Ankara 's ties with Egypt , in an interview published by an Egyptian newspaper on Tuesday during a visit to Cairo . `` I fear that matters will end in civil war between the Alawites and the Sunnis , '' Erdogan told the Al-Shorouk newspaper in an interview that marked the start of his visit to Egypt . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , who has sent tanks and troops to quell months of protests against his rule , is from the minority Alawite Muslim sect . Most Syrians are Sunni Muslims . Erdogan , who is on a tour of Arab states to boost his country 's influence in the region , said he wanted to build a strategic partnership with Egypt , the most populous Arab country , and that wanted to enhance economic and other ties . `` If the Arab world has several doors , then no doubt Egypt is its most important one , '' Erdogan said . Egypt has long viewed itself as a leading voice in the Arab world but Turkey 's influence has risen steadily with its growing economic might and its assertive policy in the region , notably towards Israel , which has drawn praise from many Arabs . In part of the interview published by Al-Shorouk a day earlier , Erdogan said Israel had `` not fully grasped the reality of changes that happened in the Arab world . '' Ankara expelled the Israeli ambassador in a feud over an Israeli raid last year that killed nine Turks on a flotilla bound for the Palestinian enclave of Gaza . Israel has said it would not apologise , which Turkey has demanded . `` Israel refused even to listen to voices of reason in the West that realized the reality of the changes in the region and called for it to apologise to Turkey to what it did to -LRB- Turkey 's -RRB- sons that it killed , '' he said . Turkey has also engaged with its neighbor Iran , which is embroiled in a standoff with the West over its nuclear ambitions . Iran is also a close ally of Syria 's . `` I think that Turkey has a role in correcting the Iranian discourse -LRB- regarding Syria -RRB- . '' He added that Turkey had been in contact with Tehran and told Iran about the `` serious consequences '' of the continuation of the use of force by Iran 's ally Syria . Erdogan has talks in Tunisia on Wednesday and is then expected to hold meetings on Thursday in Libya , where NATO air strikes that were launched to protect civilians helped rebels unseat long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi . Erdogan said Libyans should decide the country 's fate . `` Firstly , we are against international intervention in Libya . Secondly , we believe Western countries do not have a right to Libyan oil , but it belongs to its people , '' he told the newspaper .

Abdel Jalil arrived in Tripoli on Saturday for the first time since his allies chased Muammar Gaddafi out of the city , a move that political analysts saw as key to his credibility . The chairman of the ruling National Transitional Council called on the movement 's fighters not to engage in reprisal attacks against remnants of the Gaddafi government . Repeating a call made before , he also said that Islamic sharia law should be the new Libya 's main source for legislation . `` We need to open the courts to anyone who harmed the Libyan people in any way . The judicial system will decide , '' he told the crowd , calling for no attacks on former Gaddafi allies . `` We seek a state of law , prosperity and one where sharia is the main source for legislation , and this requires many things and conditions , '' he said , adding that `` extremist ideology '' would not be tolerated . Abdel Jalil had been running the provisional administration from the eastern city of Benghazi , cradle of the revolt that overthrew Gaddafi in late August . NTC officials told Reuters they did not advertise the public appearance for fear pro-Gaddafi elements would try to disrupt it . The crowd cheered , waved the independence tricolor flag . Balloons , fireworks , music and the smell of popcorn gave the gathering a carnival atmosphere . `` The most important thing was what he said about building a nation of laws , and his reassurances about extremism , from the left or the right , Islamists or secularists , '' Osama Gheriani , a 30-year-old dentist , told Reuters . `` It 's a moderate country . This was the most important point . '' Some of the hesitation in Abdel Jalil 's arrival in Tripoli after the fall of Gaddafi seemed to stem from long-standing regional rivalries and from a sense that Tripoli -- run by rebel brigades that swept in from towns and provinces eager for a share of power -- may not be a safe place for every official . The NTC 's timetable which sets out plans for a new constitution and elections over a 20-month period , should start once the NTC declares Libya 's `` liberation . '' It has yet to do so and it is unclear exactly how the disparate groups which have taken over the country will define what constitutes `` liberation . '' Several parts of the country 's south and three major towns -- Bani Walid , Sirte and Sabha -- are still controlled by forces loyal to Gaddafi . `` Bani Walid , Sirte and Sabha are now under siege by Gaddafi forces . We are betting that our brothers in those cities will fulfil their expectations and you will see them do so soon , '' Abdel Jalil said .

Speaking to Arab foreign ministers , he said Israel had undermined its legitimacy by irresponsible behavior . He made no specific accusations but has in the past criticised Israel for building settlements on occupied land envisaged as part of a Palestinian state . He has also protested over Israel 's offensive against Gaza in 2008 , which largely spelt the end of a close alliance between Turkey and Israel , and its attack on a Turkish ship heading for Gaza that killed nine people last year . Erdogan 's recent criticism of Israel has drawn strong support in the Arab world , buttressing his campaign to promote Ankara 's blend of Islam and democracy as a model for movements that have toppled several Arab autocrats , including Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak . `` While Israel is trying to secure its legitimacy in our region on one hand , it is taking irresponsible steps which unsettle its legitimacy on the other , '' Erdogan said . With the souring of relations between Turkey and Israel , military cooperation has been frozen and diplomatic ties downgraded . Erdogan 's tour will include Tunisia and Libya , which have all witnessed the fall of entrenched leaders to grassroots revolts this year , challenging the old order across the region . `` Erdogan , Erdogan ! '' cheered a group of demonstrators as the Turkish prime minister left the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo where he had been speaking . They were calling for change in Syria , whose military is trying to stamp out popular unrest . Displaying a populist touch , Erdogan stopped and shook the demonstrators ' hands . He told an Arab League ministers meeting that international recognition of a Palestinian state was `` not an option but an obligation . '' `` It 's time to raise the Palestinian flag at the United Nations . Let 's raise the Palestinian flag and let that flag be the symbol of peace and justice in the Middle East . Let 's contribute to securing well deserved peace and stability in the Middle East , '' he said . Palestinians will bid for full membership of the United Nations later this month , a move opposed by the United States , which has a veto . Arab states endorsed it at the Cairo meeting . Erdogan said Turkey offered its help to Arab nations facing turmoil but , in an apparent reference to Syria , he said some had turned down the offer . `` However , we continue to insist they meet their people 's demands . '' Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby introduced the Turkish prime minister saying : `` All the Arab peoples appreciate what you are doing . We consider that there is a strong friendly state who is always standing on the side of justice . '' Outside the League , Syrian protester Samer Zaher , 30 , said : `` Erdogan has turned into an Arab hero ... We have not found a leader as powerful as him addressing -LRB- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -RRB- and asking him to quit . '' Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador last week in a row over an Israeli raid last year that killed nine Turks on a flotilla bound for Gaza , the Palestinian enclave controlled by the Islamist group Hamas and under blockade by Israel . While winning over ordinary Arabs , particularly because of non-Arab Turkey 's tough line towards Israel , Erdogan 's growing popularity and clout could be a headache for more cautious Arab leaders who could see their own influence overshadowed . `` Turkey wants to play a regional role , especially when Egypt is busy with the revolution . Turkey thinks it 's best placed to play this leadership role , '' said Adel Soliman , head of Cairo 's International Centre for Future and Strategic Studies . Egypt has traditionally seen itself as the leading diplomatic player in the Arab region . But its position has been eroded by wealthy Gulf countries , such as Qatar , and lately overshadowed by Turkey , with its fast expanding economy . Erdogan met Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , who heads the military council that took over after Hosni Mubarak was ousted by mass street demonstrations in February . Egypt has also been embroiled in a dispute with Israel after Israel shot dead five Egyptian border guards in repelling cross-border raiders it said were Palestinian militants . But Egypt 's generals have faced popular criticism for not taking a firmer line . Cairo said it would expel Israel 's ambassador but did not follow through with threat . Protesters attacked Israel 's embassy in Cairo last week , prompting the ambassador to fly home and an embarrassed Egyptian government to affirm to Washington , its major aid donor , that it remained committed to a 1979 peace treaty with Israel . Egypt has received billions of dollars in U.S. military and other aid since making peace with the Jewish state , so the military council faces a difficult balancing act responding to public calls for an assertive policy towards Israel . Erdogan was cheered by a crowd when he arrived in Cairo and met by Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf . Many appeared to be from Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood , who approve of Erdogan 's bringing Islamists into mainstream Turkish politics . `` Erdogan , Erdogan -- a big welcome from the Brothers !

The port 's sealine was full of vessels -- now the berths are nearly empty , '' said the shipper , who opened an agency in Tartous to cash in on a boom in traffic after the Iraq war wound down . Street protests demanding the removal of Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad , many of them bloodily suppressed , have shrunk traffic at the country 's ports and damaged its hopes of capitalizing on its position as a Middle East crossroads to grab a bigger share of transit business . The exact extent to Syria 's economy is being hurt by the unrest and resulting international sanctions is not clear ; official data is scarce . But many analysts expect gross domestic product to decline this year , perhaps by several percent or more . At the start of this year , the International Monetary Fund predicted it would grow 3 percent . Shippers and businessmen say exports have dropped as foreign customers have cut orders , while Syrian importers have delayed orders because of the uncertainty . Meanwhile , companies which used Syria as a conduit to conduct trade with other countries in the region are seeking different routes . Syria 's principal port of Latakia , where the military deployed three months ago , has been hit hard along with Tartous . `` Even the Mediterranean cruise liners that came to Latakia and Tartous , and had hundreds of Italian and Spanish tourists , have not come this year , '' said the international shipper , who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue . Shipping sources say traffic in general cargoes , dry and liquid bulk cargoes , and containers at Latakia and Tartous has been slipping since the uprising broke out in March . They estimate volumes shrank an average 35 to 40 percent from a year earlier in the first eight months of 2011 . `` Importers and exporters are being very cautious , and that has led to imports of raw materials falling sharply as production slows down in many industries due to the troubles , '' a Syrian transportation official , who requested anonymity , told Reuters from Damascus . Shipping agents and industry experts said container volumes , the vast majority of which are handled by Latakia , dropped in June alone by 36 percent from a year earlier to 33,527 twenty-foot equivalent units -LRB- TEU -RRB- . Official Latakia port figures for the April-June period show a drop of 16 percent from a year earlier , but industry sources said this data was misleading because it included many containers with empty space . In Tartous , which handles most of Syria 's bulk cargoes , or nearly 9 million tonnes of annual traffic in normal times , shipping sources said some European operators were avoiding the port after the European Union announced sanctions on Syrian oil exports at the start of September . They said they were also seeing less business from Iraqi and other Arab traders who were deterred by the increasing checkpoints and roadblocks in many parts of Syria . `` We had 25 to 30 vessels daily arriving . This has dropped to between 10 to five daily , '' said a major shipping agent based in Tartous , referring to vessels between 8,000 and 35,000 tonnes . So far , major regular shipping lines such as Danish firm Maersk , French-based CMA CGM , Geneva-based MSC , and Germany 's Hamburg Sud have largely maintained normal vessel calls to Syrian ports despite lower cargo volumes , industry sources said . Shipping agents say the companies are reluctant to pull out of a transit market that has served the whole region and still has great long-term potential because of its location . `` No major regular shipping lines are quitting at the moment . Once they withdraw from any service , it 's very hard to restore , '' said Talal Halawani , a shipper whose Amman-based Liberty Shipping is an agent of a leading Italian line . `` Although they are suffering because cargo is not like before , they are still operating normally despite all the constraints . It 's a wait-and-see attitude . '' But other regional companies with no regular services have less ability to sustain losses , and they have omitted port calls or canceled visits to Syrian ports altogether . `` Liners that made container ship calls four times a month are now calling three times a month . Some regional liners , including one or two Turkish liners , have even dropped port calls altogether , '' said a second Syrian transportation official . Some shippers are seeking to offset the drop in their Syrian trade by offering more competitive rates for container slots in nearby Beirut , Mersin and Alexandria ports , which are in the same Europe-Mediterranean service . The turmoil has prompted many lines to suspend plans , some drawn up only a few months ago , to add more container slots or introduce bigger vessels on Syrian port calls in anticipation of demand related to the reconstruction of Iraq . Over the past five years , Syrian ports were able to boost their transit trade with Iraq , Jordan and the Arabian peninsula as Syria 's red tape and state controls , a legacy of five decades of Soviet-style economic management , were reduced . Latakia and Tartous were also revitalised by the award of contracts to manage their container terminals to foreign investors in partnership with local investors linked to the Assad family . The foreign investors -- CMA CGM in Latakia , and the Philippines ' International Container Terminal Services in Tartous -- upgraded the facilities and helped to nearly double the ports ' container traffic last year to 620,000 TEU from around 365,000 TEU in 2004 . Nearly 40 percent of Latakia 's total incoming cargo volume has been Iraq-bound , shippers and Syrian transportation officials say , while for Tartous the figure has been as high as 70 percent . Syrian ports ' flexibility and lower costs gave them a competitive advantage in Iraq-related business against Turkish and Lebanese ports and Jordan 's Aqaba . Lower land transport costs were also a plus , along with the ability to bypass Suez Canal fees paid by importers using Jordanian and Saudi ports on the Red Sea . Now , Iraqi , Jordanian and Saudi Arabian importers , who have used Syrian ports in recent years for bulk cargoes of wood , marble , steel and grains from the Black Sea area and North and Central Europe , are looking for alternatives . `` We are getting increasing inquiries from local and Iraqi traders who want to bring their goods to Jordan by sea from Turkey or other markets . This business traditionally would go to Syrian ports . Even goods that would normally go by land via Syria are now being shipped , '' said Captain Wahid Abu Ajamieh , general manager of CMA CGM Jordan . `` This is an indication that something odd is happening .

Pirate attacks on oil tankers and other ships are costing the world economy billions of dollars a year and navies have struggled to combat the menace , especially in the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean . `` The general trend for navies around the world is for them to have gone through a strategic defense review or something similar and emerged with either no more or in many situations less ships , '' said Captain Keith Blount , chief of staff with EUNAVFOR , the bloc 's counter-piracy naval mission off Somalia . `` Balancing priorities is very difficult for governments and counter-piracy I am afraid has to fight for its place in that list of priorities , '' he told Reuters in an interview . Naval patrols , including vessels from the European Union , the United States , South Korea , Iran and other nations have curbed the number of attacks in the Gulf of Aden , though not in the Indian Ocean . Attacks have also slowed in the past two months due to poor weather conditions . `` I think we are going to see a surge in piracy because we always have done at this time when the southwest monsoon abates and the seas become flatter , '' Blount said . `` Typically the pirates have a really good go in the autumn and winter , '' he said on the sidelines of a shipping conference . Blount said there were `` conflicting priorities with other real military activity '' in the Middle East , North Africa and other arenas . `` It is the challenge of industry and the military involved in counter-piracy to lobby governments to try and see piracy as a higher priority than it is , '' he told the conference . In recent days a French woman seized by pirates was freed after a Spanish navy patrol boat fought a fierce gun battle off the Somali coast . Blount said the military wanted to be able to operate closer to the coasts of Yemen and Eritrea . He said navies were currently only allowed to tackle piracy on the high seas , outside territorial waters , according to the terms of a U.N. convention . `` There is diplomatic activity to try and allow us have a little bit more freedom to operate in those areas , '' he said . `` Because we believe the same people are involved , we would like dearly to be able to get in there and get stuck in . '' The shipping industry , some of whose members already employ private guards , says better armed and increasingly violent seaborne gangs pose a growing threat to vital sea lanes . Blount said the military was `` completely agnostic '' on private armed guards , and nations , flag states and the industry had to be clear on whether they backed using contractors . `` I think a ship with private security onboard will be taken successfully by pirates -- it is a matter of time , '' he said . The industry last week urged the United Nations to create an armed military force to be deployed on vessels to tackle Somali piracy . `` The current military response -- with only a handful of navy ships available to provide protection on any given day -- has just been a sticking plaster on a gaping wound , '' said International Chamber of Shipping chairman Spyros Polemis . `` Governments have so far failed to protect shipping , and the smooth flow of world trade , from being literally held to ransom by Somali criminals , '' he said on Wednesday .

The Irish front row squeezed the life out of their Australian counterparts in the scrum leading to a number of penalties which flyhalfs Jonathan Sexton and Ronan O'Gara kicked to claim a 15-6 victory . Looseforward trio of Stephen Ferris , Sean O'Brien and Jamie Heaslip also had a huge impact on the match at Eden Park , forcing Australia on the backfoot time and time again as the Wallabies struggled to get their revered backs into the game . `` It is difficult to win games when your pack are second best but there was no doubt today our pack laid the platform for the victory , that is unquestionable , '' a beaming O'Driscoll told reporters after the match . `` The tight five needed to front up and our front row was immense and just gave us an opportunity to play territory and get ourselves into situations where we could kick points and there was some phenomenal turnovers as well . `` They were definitely the ones who put us in the position to win the game and I have no problem giving them the credit they deserve to win the game . '' As good as the Irish pack were , the late withdrawal of Wallaby flanker David Pocock with a back injury early on Saturday played a part as they were able to dominate the key breakdown area and slow up ball for Australia 's potent halfback pair of Will Genia and Quade Cooper . Ireland head coach Declan Kidney was quick to play down the significance of Pocock 's absence . `` Probably about the same as the absence of David Wallace , '' Kidney replied , referring to Ireland 's first-choice openside who was ruled out of the tournament with a long-term knee injury last month . `` It did n't matter , we knew we had to win the breakdown . It does n't matter who 's playing in a match , it is a rugby World Cup . `` You always want to play a team at full tilt , the fact that David Pocock was unfortunate enough to be out injured , I 'm sure he 'll come back and play a big part in the tournament , but you can only play what 's out against you . `` Our guys played well tonight , it is the first time our backrow combination has had a game together and they can get stronger from tonight 's performance . '' The forward effort was only matched by a phenomenal support on a wet and windy night in Auckland . Irish fans and New Zealand locals dressed in green hoping the Six Nations side could turn over the All Blacks ' rivals , made up the majority of the 60,000 crowd at Eden Park as they roared their , or adopted , side on . `` It felt like a home game and definitely when you are tired and struggling for a second wind or a third wind that cheer can often be the boost you need , '' O'Driscoll said . `` Hopefully we can continue with great Irish support - and anyone else who wants to jump on the bandwagon .

After long maintaining close relations with neighbor Syria , Turkey has spoken out increasingly against Assad , urging him to end a military crackdown on a popular uprising and to launch democratic reforms . During a tour of Arab countries last week , Erdogan said that Turkey 's approach to Syria had changed and that Ankara would soon announce its `` final '' decision on Syria by the time the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York . `` I halted talks with the Syrian government . I did not want to come to this point . But the Syrian government forced us to make such a decision , '' Erdogan told Turkish journalists in New York on Wednesday after meeting U.S. President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly . `` The United States has sanctions regarding Syria . Our foreign ministers will be working together to decide what our sanctions may be , '' Erdogan said . `` As a result of this cooperation , the sanctions may not resemble those on Libya . Every sanction differs according to country , people and demographic structure . Thus , sanctions on Syria will be different . We have preliminary studies on the issue , '' he said , according to the state agency Anatolian . Assad 's attempt to stamp out dissent by having troops and tanks assault restive areas has prompted the United States and European Union to gradually escalate economic sanctions against the authoritarian Damascus leadership . Turkey , which has been Syria 's main trading partner , had resisted sanctions up to now after suffering the consequences of past generations of sanctions imposed on next-door Iraq during Saddam Hussein 's rule and now on Iran , another neighbor . Bilateral trade between Turkey and Syria was $ 2.5 billion in 2010 , up from $ 500 million in 2004 . Investments of Turkish firms in Syria reached $ 260 million , Turkish official data show . Turkey , a Muslim member of NATO that has applied to join the European Union , is one of the few countries in the world that has had open communication lines with Damascus . Under Turkey 's policy of `` zero problems '' with its neighbors , Ankara built up political and commercial relations with Syria after the two almost went to war in the 1990s over Kurdish guerrillas harboured by Damascus . But with Syrian refugees fleeing to Turkish camps across the border and Assad defying repeated international calls to return his forces to barracks and open up to reform , Turkey has found itself in the awkward position of trying to champion democracy in the region while maintaining ties , especially for trade purposes , with the Middle East 's autocratic leaders . The United States and EU , along with the governments of Britain , France and Germany , have called for Assad to quit . Erdogan , who once vacationed together with Assad and his family on the Turkish Mediterranean coast , has stopped short of calling for his departure . But he told journalists in New York , `` We do not have any confidence in the current government , '' and accused Damascus of launching `` dark propaganda against Turkey '' . The Syrian crisis has pushed Ankara and Washington into closer cooperation , despite U.S. concerns over a fraying of relations between its allies Turkey and Israel . Syria sits at the heart of numerous conflicts in the Middle East , and Turkey and Iran have competed for influence there . An unstable Syria would have repercussions for Turkey , which also borders Iran and Iraq .

The Lichfield-based company has valued the amount of shale gas in place -- not the recoverable volume -- at its site near Blackpool at 200 trillion cubic feet , the top end of what is estimated can be recovered from Europe 's largest reserves in Poland . `` If we were to have a field development plan we would guess that one or two years from next summer is when we 'd start selling gas on a well-by-well basis , '' said Cuadrilla Resources Chief Executive Mark Miller . Fracking work -- an exploration method used to retrieve gas trapped in rock formations by injecting high-pressure water , sand and chemicals -- at the site in the Bowland Basin was suspended in June after scientists measured two earth tremors in the area . But Miller is confident the government will allow his company to continue operations after reviewing a report into the incidents due to be submitted to the energy ministry -LRB- DECC -RRB- early next month . `` I am convinced that when the report is out the public , DECC and the regulatory authorities will look at that and be confident we can carry forward our fracking operations without any issues , '' Miller said . Countries like France have adopted a harsh stance against shale gas on grounds that it damages the environment and banned all exploration work . The UK government has not made any comments about banning the technology and a parliamentary report in May said there was no need to impose a moratorium on conventional gas drilling . Within six to eight months Cuadrilla Resources will have carried out further tests to estimate how much of the vast reserves it can recover . The company 's high-end case foresees drilling 800 wells over 16 years and hopes for a 20 percent recovery margin per well , Miller said . Cuadrilla Resources has a five-year licence until 2013 to explore for gas in the Bowland Basin and will decide next summer whether to apply for a production licence . The firm estimates its business could generate 5-6 billion pounds in tax revenue for the government over 30 years and 120 million pounds in income for local councils .

After a series of piecemeal measures , European governments have acted vigorously in recent weeks to tighten the screws on Assad in hopes of reining in his bloody crackdown on protesters , which has killed some 2,700 people in six months , the U.N. says . From Saturday , the EU will ban European firms from making new investments in Syria 's oil industry following an earlier ban on imports of Syrian oil , a key source of revenues for Assad 's government . Syria has said it can sidestep sanctions by selling oil to Russia or China . But traders said on Thursday most Syrian attempts to sell oil or related products in recent weeks have failed due to a lack of bids . `` Exports are fully paralysed . No one wants to touch it . Banks are not financing the operations . Russian companies listed in New York wo n't take the risks , '' said a trader in the Mediterranean who used to regularly deal with Syrian oil . EU sanctions allow imports of Syrian oil until Nov. 15 under contracts signed before Sept. 2 but traders said they had not seen any fresh shipments in the past weeks . `` As far as Chinese and the Indians are concerned , they could of course try to buy some volumes . But the economics do n't make any sense for them and volumes are too small to take the risks , '' the Mediterranean trader added . Markets have reacted calmly to the loss of Syrian crude as the country produces just 385,000 barrels per day , or less than 0.5 percent of global supply , and exports around 150,000 bpd -- only a fraction of Libya 's pre-war shipments , the loss of which seven month ago as civil war erupted rocked the oil markets . Syria is now hunting for new buyers , mostly for its heavy Souedie crude . But its crude oil tender and a naphtha tender have lured no bids , traders said . Sources at several major Chinese and Russian buyers contacted by Reuters said they had no plans to buy Syrian crude , which could potentially force the country to stockpile oil . Turkey , which previously supported Assad , has said it could impose sanctions on the country thus further limiting the options for Damascus to sell its oil and products . Sources told Reuters that Indian state-run firm ONGC was considering shipping crude to India from its Syrian joint venture instead of selling it in Europe but has not made a final decision yet . Syria can only refine up to 240,000 bpd so it does not have anywhere near enough spare capacity to process all the crude it has been selling to Europe until now and it will have therefore to slash crude production at some point . In a sign of the economic damage wreaked by the unrest , the International Monetary Fund said this week it expects Syria 's economy to shrink by 2 percent this year -- down from a 3 percent growth estimate made previously . Analysts said the sanctions are beginning to have a real impact on the Syrian economy but it will take a long time before Assad 's powers are seriously undermined . `` Although the regime 's position is compromised it still retains ample military power along with the support of the business community in Damascus and Aleppo -- though that support may peel away as the economy deteriorates , '' said Ayham Kamel from Eurasia think-tank . He estimated that Assad would stay in power for at least another six months . Assad inherited power on the death of his father in 2000 and retains the loyalty of the core of his armed forces comprised mostly of members of the Alawite minority , to which his family belongs . Catherine Hunter from IHS Global Insight said it would be important to see which monetary thresholds the European Union imposes on fresh investments in the oil industry from Saturday . `` I do n't think it will necessarily have an overnight impact on the regime ... If you look at the restrictions on Iran , it has taken a number of years for those to become apparent in terms of actual production levels , '' she said . The European Union buys nearly all of Syria 's exported oil and analysts have said oil companies have a vested interest in the current government , which has provided favourable operating conditions for oil firms . European diplomats have said they are reluctant to impose full-scale sanctions on Syria to avoid increasing the suffering of the Syrian people by cutting off fuel needed for power generation . Oil revenues are especially important for Syria as its tourism industry , which normally accounts for around 12 percent of the economy , has been hit hard by the violence . An internal memorandum from an oil company , seen by Reuters , predicts that Syria may soon face insufficient supply of petroleum products which will affect heating , electricity production , domestic usage and transportation . '' -LRB- It -RRB- will make the winter period much harder for the public . This will leave the Assad administration in a more difficult position against the public , '' it said .

But instead of burning down forest for his growing herd to graze freely he will break with tradition , reducing his pastureland and adding grain to their diet . Val is one of a growing number of farmers betting on so-called integrated farming by diversifying production and revenue . His move epitomizes a quiet and fragile revolution that marks a departure from Brazil 's slash-and-burn past . It is a trend that may also help ease the felling of the world 's largest rain forest . Soy growers are rotating fields with more corn and cotton , planting forest and raising cattle . Ranchers are planting corn to supplement their herd 's traditional diet of grasses . This tends toward greater and more efficient output while easing pressure for expanding area , and bodes well for the consumers struggling worldwide with higher food prices , as well as conservationists who see Brazil as a crucial battlefield . Such investments in yield are not new in the United States or Europe . They are , however , in the tropical grain and cattle belt of Brazil , which means there are risks and uncertainties . `` I lose 80 calves a year to jaguars , '' Val said from a dark hardwood paneled farm house in southern Para state , where any movement more complex than breathing triggers perspiration . Val , a Sao Paulo University-educated sociologist , is one of a growing number of farmers taking a more scientific view of production . He has hired consultants to help acquire a whole new set of skills in grain farming . Yet , he still embodies many of the older ruralist sentiments that thrived here in an era defined by man-versus-nature . The jungle and the bush were the enemy . Brazil , with its chronic social inequalities , relied on homesteading until the last decade to populate and secure its vast , United States-sized Val 's father packed 40 days by burro to the area that is now Redencao in 1959 -- aging black-and-white photographs of that trek don the walls of his son 's farm house . The shoot-from-the-hip , pioneering spirit is still revered here . He secured government financing to clear 220 square miles of forested land that he had bought title to and named Santa Teresa Ranch . The family has since sold off most of the farm . The dictatorship of the time threatened to repossess homesteaders ' land if they failed to improve it , which meant clearing the forest to raise cattle and plant crops . Unbridled expansionist policies eventually brought environmental and trade pressure to a head in the last decade , on fears the Amazon would be lost , hastening global warming . Government efforts to rein in agriculture also threaten to derail the very investments needed by farmers to keep yields improving in existing areas and for orderly , legal expansion . Brazil 's 5.3-million square mile area still has over 625,000 square miles of unutilized land that could be legally converted to agricultural ends , according to the IBGE . Katia Abreu , a senator and the head of the National Confederation of Agriculture , estimates that current laws governing land use criminalize 70-90 percent of Brazil 's 5 million growers and ranchers for cutting forest that had been state-sponsored under previous governments . Some are guilty of illegal clearing after the laws had forbidden such practices , she admits . `` The bulk of them are more victims of bad enforcement of the law , '' Abreu said , adding that a new law before Congress should normalize most farmers ' legal status . The implications for global food prices could be profound . China , Europe and the Middle East are Brazil 's main buyers and a couple percentage points variation in its output of soy , beef , sugar and coffee could send market prices reeling . Val plans to invest 3 million reais -LRB- $ 1.8 million -RRB- to plant corn on 9 square miles of his 88 square miles of pasture . The remaining 94 square miles of his ranch must remain forested reserve in this part of the Amazon . His farm is in legal order and thus would be eligible for government subsidized financing . But many farms are not . Four hours south of Val 's farm by twin-engine plane lies the 80-square-mile Falavinha integrated farm in Deciolandia , Mato Grosso . It was categorized as savanna biome , which means 20-35 percent of the farm had to be forested reserve . But , after authorities redrew Brazil 's biomes , the region may be forced to comply with Amazon Basin requirements of 50 percent reserve . The costs of replanting would be high . Federal agencies are also notoriously slow to provide vital services . Farms bigger than 3 square miles must submit satellite maps of their land to agrarian reform agency Incra . But farmers say Incra is understaffed for the workload as it is , and the government plans to eventually expand the number of farms to smaller properties that must submit maps . `` We spent 10,000 reais to complete the farm 's mapping and submitted it a year ago and still nothing , '' the owner of the farm , Geraldo Falavinha , said over the roar of cotton gins . `` We are locked out of government financing and need to invest . '' The keystone to large-scale integrated farming in Brazil is cattle , especially as far as preservation of the Amazon and other tropical biomes are concerned . In Para , Val says he will expand his herd to roughly 30,000 from 20,000 . A recent study by the Institute for Atmospheric Research Research singled out cattle ranching as the main agricultural source of pressure behind deforestation . Inevitably , leaders in Brazilian agriculture and ranching will throw out numbers about the 137,000 square miles of pasture in Brazil that can be easily converted into farmland `` without having to cut a single tree . '' Brazil currently plants 66,875 square miles to crops and commercial forest . But converting pasture into planted area is not simple . It raises the question of where the cattle will graze . Brazil 's beef production is grass-fed , unlike in the United States and Europe where grain on feedlots is used mostly . The U.S. writer on food Michael Pollan says cattle should be taken off `` their typical feedlot diet of grain '' and allowed `` to eat grass '' , to help bring down sky-high grain prices . In Brazil -- the world 's top exporter of beef and a major grain producer -- many ranchers and farmers would disagree . `` Cattle need to eat more grain here to reach slaughter faster . There 's less environmental impact , '' Darci Ferrarin Jr. said his DGF integrated farm in Sorriso , Mato Grosso . Brazil could double or triple the cattle per hectare from the present average of nearly 1 head\\/ha simply by introducing grain to their diet , better breeding practices and fertilizing and replanting grasses in pastures , beef analysts say . `` We make more money from this type of farming , but nature and consumers benefit , '' he added , while leaning on one of his sister 's prize-winning white Nelore heifers that stands nearly seven-feet-tall and weighs as much as a mid-sized car . -LRB- Editing by Todd Benson , Kieran Murray and Alden Bentley -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "142", "dct": "2011-09-23", "dates": [], "text": "NYSE and AMEX quotes delayed by at least 20 minutes .

The private meeting came on the second day of Benedict 's four-day trip to Germany , where record numbers of Catholics have officially left the faith in protest at clerical abuse , and where the Church faces some 600 requests for compensation . The Pope was `` moved and deeply shaken '' and assured victims the Church was `` committed to the promotion of effective measures to protect children , '' the Vatican said in a statement . The meeting took place in a seminary in Erfurt , in eastern Germany , and was similar to those held by Benedict on other recent trips . The wording of the statement also mirrored those issued after previous meetings . Victims ' associations have said the Vatican has not done enough to bring the perpetrators to justice , a view echoed by German victims who joined 8,000 protesters on a march through Berlin , where the Pope began his visit . Earlier on Friday the Pope visited the monastery where Martin Luther lived before launching the Reformation , and warned his Lutheran hosts that `` a new form of Christianity '' posed challenges to mainline Protestants and Catholics alike . While not naming them , it was clear he was referring to the evangelical and Pentecostal churches which have spread rapidly , especially in developing countries , by attracting converts from more established churches . He appealed for unity between Roman Catholics and Protestants , who began their split from the Catholic Church when Luther , who had lived in Erfurt as a Catholic monk , posted his 95 theses on a church door in 1517 . Few people turned out to see the pope in Erfurt , a Protestant city under tight security for the visit , but about 90,000 Catholics -- 40,000 more than expected -- flooded the nearby Catholic town of Etzelsbach for a vespers service . Benedict told the Lutherans : `` Faced with a new form of Christianity , which is spreading with overpowering missionary dynamism , sometimes in frightening ways , the mainstream Christian denominations often seem at a loss . `` This is a form of Christianity with little institutional depth , little rationality and even less dogmatic content , and with little stability . This worldwide phenomenon poses a question to us all : what is this new form of Christianity saying to us , for better and for worse ? '' Geoff Tunnicliffe , Vancouver-based secretary general of the World Evangelical Alliance , told Reuters his organization had recently issued a code of conduct for responsible missionary work with the Vatican and World Council of Churches . `` I do n't see this as a blanket statement on evangelicals , which includes Pentecostals , '' he said . The three groups that signed the pioneering code of conduct in June , after five years ' work , claim to represent over 90 percent of Christianity . While stressing Christian unity , Benedict deflected recent public appeals from Protestants for a relaxation of rules barring them from participating in Catholic communion . He said it was a `` political misunderstanding '' to think he would come with an `` ecumenical gift '' such as permission for Protestants to receive the Catholic eucharist . Germany 's top Protestant bishop urged the pontiff to take `` real steps for reconciliation '' before the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in 2017 , which the Protestants would like to mark with Catholic participation . Luther is `` as a hinge between our two churches , because he belongs to both , '' said Lutheran Bishop Nikolaus Schneider , head of the Evangelical Church in Germany . `` It is time to heal the memories of the mutual injuries in the Reformation period and the subsequent history of our Churches . '' Chancellor Angela Merkel , daughter of a Lutheran pastor , attended the service highlighted by interludes of sacred organ music by Johann Sebastian Bach and other German composers . Erfurt , where atheism is also widespread after four decades of communism , gave the pope a cool reception . There were few posters or banners announcing his presence . In a shop near the cathedral , atheist Dagmar Schneidert said : `` I do n't know anyone who is enthusiastic about the visit , only 7 percent of people in Erfurt are Catholic anyway . It 's wasted money that could be used for something more meaningful . '' The pope is due to hold an open-air mass in central Erfurt on Saturday at which Church officials expect 85,000 Catholics . At Etzelsbach , in the Eichsfeld region near the former Iron Curtain between East and West Germany , Benedict praised Catholics for keeping the faith despite pressure from `` two godless dictatorships '' -- Nazism and Communism . `` Eichsfeld is a very religious place , '' said Holungen Wiebert , 67 . `` We 're very proud to have a German pope again , for the first time in 500 years . '' Polish , Croatian and Bavarian flags in the crowd indicated some pilgrims had come long distances to see the pope . Before leaving Berlin , Benedict met leaders of Germany 's four million Muslims and promised cooperation with them as long as they respect Germany 's constitution and the limits it sets on pluralism . Merkel warned Muslims last year that sharia , Islamic law , had no place in Germany . Muslim leaders praised the pope for confirming through the meeting that Islam was now a part of German society , but said their loyalty to the constitution was never in question . `` As Muslims in Germany , we have always said that we see the German constitution as a good basis for peaceful life together , '' said Bekir Alboga , head of interreligious dialogue for the Turkish mosque association DITIB . He said the pope 's short address also represented a change from his controversial 2006 speech in Regensburg , where his use of a Byzantine emperor 's quote about Islam being violent and irrational provoked protests across the Muslim world . `` The pope has now chosen a new approach in his meeting with Muslims , '' Alboga said . `` I think one must look to the future and see where the possibilities for good cooperation are .

Erdogan , in an interview on CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' to be aired on Sunday , maintained his stern tone toward Israel and warned relations may `` never become normal again '' but he had warm words for U.S. President Barack Obama as Turkey rises as a diplomatic power in the Middle East . `` You can never remain in power through cruelty . You can never stand before the will of the people , '' Erdogan said in a transcript released by CNN on Saturday . `` This process might be extended a little bit more but sooner or later in Syria , if people take a different decision , that decision is going to be catered to . Such as in Egypt , such as in Tunisia , such as in Libya . People want to be free . '' Democracy is overtaking autocracy , he said , and `` dictatorial systems are burning down to the ground . '' Turkey , a NATO member and aspirant to join the European Union , is viewed as a bridge between the Western and Islamic worlds . Erdogan has had unprecedented access to Obama , holding nine phone calls with the U.S. president this year . `` Personally , Barack Obama is someone I really like . And vis-a-vis his policies and his implementations , I want him to be much more successful , '' Erdogan said , wishing him luck in the November 2012 elections . But the United States and Turkey differ greatly on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as a showdown looms over Palestinian statehood at the United Nations . Ankara 's once-friendly ties with Israel crumbled over the killing of Turkish activists on a Gaza-bound aid convoy by Israeli forces last year . `` In this situation , no matter who we are speaking about , democracy , rights and freedom should be defended , '' Erdogan said . `` We gave our warnings to Israel . This is the reason for war . This is something you can not do in international waters . But as a great state , we have been very forgiving . That 's why we have been very patient . '' Turkey has demanded Israel apologize , pay compensation and lift the Gaza embargo . `` If these demands are not met , the relations between Turkey and Israel will never become normal again . We have got nothing against the people of Israel but against the attitude adopted by the administration of Israel , '' Erdogan said . `` And if you are insistent on creating a source of unrest , you are bound to become lonelier and lonelier . They used to be great friends of ours . And this solitude is Israel 's fate under these circumstances . '' Turkey has embraced Palestine 's position for statehood , while Obama has said he would block any Palestinian bid for full recognition at the U.N. Security Council . `` SO FED UP WITH WARS '' Erdogan sought to address perceptions that Turkey is moving toward a more Islamic foreign policy , abandoning a history of pro-Western sentiment . `` We seek out knowledge from whichever part of the world that is most advanced , '' he said . `` We do n't want to see the clash of civilizations in this world . We want to see the alliance of civilizations . The world is so fed up with wars . '' The prime minister tried to calm concerns over plans for a missile defense base in Turkey , saying the installation is a NATO concept and not a factor in Iran 's tensions with Israel . `` We do n't think Iran should get offended when there 's no reason . We do n't want to see Israel coming up with different interpretations from what is actually the reality , '' he said . He questioned why Iran should be banned from having nuclear technology while Israel is allowed to be the only country in the region with nuclear weapons . `` Iran says that its only purpose is to generate affordable energy through nuclear power . We do not want to act on presumptions , and no sanctions based on presumptions are acceptable by Turkey , '' Erdogan said . He also addressed reports he had taken holidays with Assad , whose crackdown on protests in Syria has led to U.S. calls for the long-time leader to step aside . Erdogan said Assad was invited to a popular holiday locale but it was to discuss relations between the two countries and the two leaders never took a vacation together . He said he finally lost patience with Assad . `` If you 're going to act against the fundamental rights , liberties and the law , you will lose your position in my heart as my brother and my friend , '' Erdogan said . `` I was very patient .

Experts worry that giving new moms the free samples could undermine official recommendations that they stick to breastfeeding until their baby is at least six months old . `` If a hospital gives it out ... the patient thinks it 's the best thing for the baby , '' said Anne Merewood from Boston Medical Center , who worked on the new study . `` The bottom line is that the hospitals are marketing for the formula industry . '' The free samples typically come in diaper bags that maternity wards give out to moms when they leave the hospital . Sometimes those bags are funded by the hospital . But as research has shown , more often than not they 're provided by formula companies . `` The companies have an incentive to give as much away early on , because it kind of gets hospitals and mothers hooked on that , '' said Chessa Lutter , regional advisor on food and nutrition for the Pan American Health Organization , part of the World Health Organization . In 2007 , Merewood and her colleagues surveyed hospitals in every state and found that more than 90 percent of them gave company-sponsored formula to mothers . To see if anything had changed , last year the researchers went back to all hospitals in the 10 states that were most likely to give out free formula and the 10 that were least likely to do so . Of the more than 1,200 hospitals in those 20 states , 72 percent said they gave out company-sponsored samples to some or all mothers , compared to the 86 percent in 2007 . Merewood said that trend may be due to grassroots movements working to promote breastfeeding . The states least likely to hand out the freebies include California , Massachusetts and Minnesota . Yet the 10 states most likely to give out samples , including Oklahoma , New Jersey and Texas still distribute them at 93 percent of their hospitals , the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics . `` Most of them are still giving it out , '' Merewood told Reuters Health . `` It 's not too rosy a picture . '' The free samples are an ethical issue for hospitals because mothers might think that their doctors endorse the formula , and that they should use it instead of , or in addition to breastfeeding , Merewood said . She and Lutter said that just about all formula companies sponsor samples , because they 're at a competitive disadvantage when moms shop for formula on their own if they do n't . Lutter , who was n't involved in the new study , said there 's no law in the U.S. saying formula companies ca n't use hospitals to give out samples of their products -- but the WHO has come out strongly against that practice in all countries . Not accepting free formula , she said , `` is essential for assuring that the knee-jerk reaction for hospital -LRB- staff -RRB- as well as moms is not to go to the formula when there 's any question or any concerns '' about breastfeeding . Breastfeeding has a number of health benefits for kids , Lutter pointed out . That includes prevention against infection , and possibly an IQ boost . After six months of exclusive breastfeeding , the WHO recommends at least partial breastfeeding up to two years or longer . While formula might be helpful when new mothers ca n't breastfeed for one reason or another , free samples usually do little good , Merewood said . `` Nurses like to give things to people , especially when they 're not very wealthy , '' she told Reuters Health . `` It 's not really a gift , because it 's not good for their health . '' Abbott Nutrition , which makes formula , would not comment on the study . The International Formula Council , which represents formula manufacturers and marketers , told Reuters Health that formula samples serve a valuable purpose . `` The IFC believes mothers should be trusted to make good choices for their babies according to their individual family circumstances , '' it said in an email to Reuters Health . `` Hospital discharge packs provide key educational materials , which may include an infant formula sample -- directing moms to the right type of formula and to proper use and storage instructions , if needed . '' But Lutter and Merewood agreed that there 's little room for debate about the right move for hospitals when it comes to company freebies . `` Hospitals should not accept any donations of a formula , '' Lutter said . ly\\/jsoh2P Pediatrics , online September 26 , 2011 .

Full Article ANALYSIS - Iraqi Shi'ites fear fallout of Syria turbulence BAGHDAD | Wed Sep 28 , 2011 2:25 pm IST BAGHDAD -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Iraqi Shi'ites , like their allies in Iran , fret that unrest in Syria could oust President Bashar al-Assad and bring to power hardline Sunnis eager to put their weight behind fellow-Sunnis in Iraq who have lost out since Saddam Hussein 's fall . They fear the turmoil next door could spill into Iraq , reignite sectarian violence and intensify a proxy battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia , which sees itself as the bastion of Sunni Islam and has never come to terms with Shi'ite rule in Baghdad . `` If Syria falls , Iraq will work with Iran to influence events in Syria , '' said a senior Iraqi Shi'ite politician , who asked not to be named . `` Change in Syria will cause major problems for Iraq . They -LRB- Sunnis -RRB- will incite the western -LRB- Sunni -RRB- part of Iraq . '' Iraqi Shi'ite militias are unlikely to fight for Assad 's survival , but might respond if Sunnis in Iraq 's western Anbar province were emboldened by the rise of Sunni power in Syria . Syria was the only Arab nation to side with Iran in the 1980-88 war with Iraq . Assad 's minority Alawite sect is a distant offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . Syria links Iran logistically with its Lebanese Shi'ite Hezbollah guerrilla proteges . Despite violent repression that , by a U.N. count , has killed 2,700 people , Assad has failed to quell six months of protests mostly involving majority Sunnis . The anti-Assad movement has sought to shun any sectarian agenda , but Sunni Islamists may emerge as a significant force if the president is deposed . `` Will Iran , Hezbollah in Lebanon and their allies in Iraq stand idle and watch Assad collapse and thus bring down with him one of the pillars of the ` Shi'ite Crescent ' without reacting ? Impossible , '' said Iraqi political analyst Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie . `` Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Arab powers will try to redraw the political map in Iraq to increase Sunni influence in decision-making because until now they have not made peace with Shi'ite rule here , '' he said . To protect their interests , Syria , Hezbollah and Iran would `` try to unsettle the security situation in Iraq through their relationships with Shi'ites and Sunnis '' , Sumaidaie added . Since the fall of Saddam , a bitter foe of Tehran , some Sunni rulers in the Middle East have talked of the emergence of a `` Shi'ite Crescent '' running from Iran through Iraq and Alawite-ruled Syria to Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon . Iran , projecting a pan-Islamic image , rejects any such sectarian concept , referring instead to an `` axis of resistance '' . The Islamic Republic 's influence , which has burgeoned since the U.S.-led war in Iraq , would take a damaging hit if Assad fell , with repercussions for Iraq and the rest of the region . Iraq is trying to end a legacy of sectarian violence that drove it to the brink of civil war in 2006-07 , just as U.S. troops prepare to complete their withdrawal by December 31 . It has taken a muted stance on Syria , while Saudi Arabia and some other Arab nations have condemned Assad 's crackdown . Iraqi Shi'ite politicians can give Assad diplomatic and financial support , said the senior politician , `` because we do n't want a government inimical to Iraq to be installed in Damascus '' . He said Iraq could provide intelligence on people and arms being smuggled across the border , and ensure ample trade and financial ties with Syria , which last week banned most imports in an effort to conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves . Syria , which also borders Israel , Lebanon , Turkey and Jordan , has some influence in Iraq , although the two countries feuded when each was ruled by rival wings of the Baath Party . Saddam 's fall in 2003 brought majority Shi'ites to power in Iraq , which now has better ties with Iran and Syria , allies in a regional power struggle against U.S.-backed Sunni-ruled states . Last year Iran brokered a deal between Iraq 's main Shi'ite factions , helping them tighten their grip on power , with the blessing of Syria and Turkey , guaranteeing another term for Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki , a Shi'ite , Iraqi politicians say . Many Iraqi Shi'ite politicians believe Saudi Arabia and other Sunni countries are scheming to topple Assad -- and push Iraqi Sunnis to secede and create their own region . `` If Saudi Arabia became influential in Syria , the Wahhabis will join forces with the people in western Iraq . There will be a war inside Iraq , '' said the senior Shi'ite politician . Saudi Arabia , whose monarchy rules in a pact with ultra strict Wahhabi clerics , is at odds with Iraq 's Shi'ite - led government and intervened in Bahrain to help its Sunni rulers crush protests led by majority Shi'ites earlier this year . Riyadh was already alarmed at popular revolts that had overthrown the U.S.-aligned presidents of Egypt and Tunisia . `` We do n't fear Sunni rule in Syria , but we fear Wahhabi influence in Syria . We have evidence that Saudi Arabia wants to break the Shi'ite Crescent , '' said a Shi'ite lawmaker . `` If a radical Sunni region was created here that wants to overthrow the Shi'ites , everyone will fight , '' said the lawmaker , a member of the Badr Organisation , the former armed wing of the Iranian-backed Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council . `` We have enough weapons to arm everyone . '' The lawmaker ruled out military intervention in Syria by Iraqi Shi'ite militias armed and funded by Iran . But he left the door open for an internal Iraqi sectarian conflict if the outcome of the Syrian crisis undermines Shi'ites in Iraq . Iraq has dozens of Sunni and Shi'ite armed groups fighting for turf . The two best-known Shi'ite militias , Asaib al-Haq and Kata'ib Hizballah , are Iranian-backed splinters from the Shi'ite Mehdi Army of anti-U.S. cleric Moqtada al-Sadr . Iraqi politicians said Iran was watching Syria with alarm and would try to prevent any hardline Sunni grab for power in western Iraq , using its sway with Shi'ites , Kurds and Sunnis . `` Iran has many good relationship with Sunni tribal sheikhs in Anbar and Salahudin provinces ... to protect Shi'ite unity and stop any plan to establish an Islamist Sunni emirate in Iraq , '' said the Shi'ite lawmaker . Another senior Shi'ite politician close to Maliki said if Tehran loses Damascus as an ally , it would use financial aid and diplomacy to try to build up Iraq as a Shi'ite regional power . `` Iranian clout in Iraq is stronger than any other country . Because it built a relationship with the Sunnis , Shi'ites and Kurds and it will influence the political landscape in Iraq through this , '' the politician said .

Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday attempted to wrest control of a central town from military forces that had gone over to the opposition , whilst in other towns there were also reports of fighters coming together . Details were far from clear and diplomats and other sources said defecting units appeared a `` hodgepodge '' who might struggle to mount a sustained fight against superior forces . Protesters have occasionally seized weapons to attack security forces , but witnesses say protests have been generally peaceful . The appearance of loosely organized groups of military deserters lends a new dimension to the uprising . `` The strategy of peaceful opposition is clearly losing ground in the face of Assad 's brutal counter response and the call to arms is gaining currency as the only way of dislodging the regime , '' said Julien Barnes-Dacey , Middle East analyst at London-based consultancy Control Risks . `` The key question is whether or not this will spread and result in a more decisive break right across the military . '' Most believe that is unlikely . Syria 's military has long been divided along sectarian lines and most expect that the units most dedicated to Assad -- made up largely of Alawites who are an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam -- will remain loyal . That could leave neither side with the strength to win and open the door to months or years of war . The risk , experts say , is that neither side feels they can back down with the opposition fearing they will be hunted down and killed if Assad can reassert control whilst Alawites and other allied groups fear reprisals if he goes . Whilst some in Syria 's somewhat unsupported opposition may have ambitions of repeating the success of their counterparts in Libya in ultimately marching on the capital and taking power , few analysts believe that a plausible imminent outcome . `` The regime will most likely use this to in order to justify and further intensify its bloody crackdown , '' says Anthony Skinner , Middle East and North Africa director at political risk consultancy Maplecroft . `` This increases the risk of Syria sliding into a civil war . '' Some worry about a further regionalization of the conflict . In Bahrain , largely Sunni Gulf states backed the monarchy as it crushed unrest from primarily Shi'ite demonstrators demanding equal rights in jobs and public services . That raised hackles on both sides of the Middle East 's sectarian divide that could worsen further if largely Shi'ite Iran ramps up support for its long-time ally Assad and Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia move closer to backing the opposition . `` This has a lot of worrying regional implications , particularly if it leads to Syria moving toward becoming a failed state , '' said Stephen Heydemann , a senior vice president and regional specialist at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington . `` There 's a risk it could exacerbate regional tensions that have already been made worse by Bahrain . '' Sectarian fighting in Syria could also raise tensions between assorted other smaller cross-border groupings in neighboring countries including Alawites and Kurds in Turkey and Shi'ites and Sunnis in Lebanon . For now , analysts say it is still too soon to say whether enough soldiers will defect to form a force that could be a significant military threat to the Damascus government . `` The rate of defections is increasing , '' says Alan Fraser , Middle East analyst for London-based risk consultancy AKE . `` However ... it is coming amid a fall in the number of protests throughout the country -- which are slowly losing momentum amid the ongoing crackdown . It will take significantly greater numbers of defectors to significantly threaten the regime . '' Nor is it yet clear to what extent the wider , somewhat disparate opposition movement wants to embrace a more violent approach . The Syrian National Council , a unified opposition formed this month to support the uprising , and the Local Coordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , the grassroots activist network that has powered the rolling demonstrations across Syria over the past six months , are explicitly against recourse to violence . `` It is not a countrywide trend , '' said Peter Harling of the International Crisis Group . `` In parts of the country people have been preparing themselves ... but continue showing restraint . In others , they simply can not afford weapons . '' In the longer run , some analysts say the opposition 's best hope is to try to hang on in the hope that ever tightening sanctions take their toll on Assad 's rule . Sanctions will likely starve his government of the oil sales that make up some 30 percent of government revenue , whilst much of the wider economy is also now effectively moribund or shut down . `` The Libya option is n't there , particularly because the Europeans and other regional powers are n't willing to play the role they played in Libya , '' said Jon Alterman , Middle East program director of the Center for Security and International Studies in Washington DC . `` There might be the option of some kind of covert operations support for the opposition but it 's hard to see what the point or strategy might be . '' Many outside groups working with Syria 's protesters have long tried to persuade them that taking up arms is the wrong way of pursuing their struggle , encouraging them instead to pursue non-violent methods such as boycotts and strikes . `` Any violence committed by opposition forces will harm the movement , '' said Srdja Popovic , a Serbian activist involved in the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic in 2001 and who now works with dissident groups worldwide including the Syrians . `` It will also diminish the possibility of achieving unity within the Syrian people and building a realistic alternative .

At least 1,000 deserters and armed villagers have been fighting tank - and helicopter-backed forces trying to regain control of Rastan , a town of 40,000 , in central Syria . `` They have got a foothold in the southern part of Rastan , but the Free Syrian Army is fighting back and has destroyed three armored vehicles , '' said one resident by satellite phone . `` Buildings have caught fire in several neighborhoods from tank fire , '' he said from the town , which lies about 180 km -LRB- 112 miles -RRB- north of Damascus , among farmland and wheat fields on the Orontes River and on the northern highway leading to Aleppo . Syrian authorities have not commented on the assault , but in the past they have denied any army defections , blaming `` foreign meddling '' for the turmoil in the country of 20 million . `` They have got a foothold in the southern part of Rastan , but the Free Syrian Army is fighting back and has destroyed three armored vehicles , '' said one resident by satellite `` highly possible '' that defectors were holding their ground . After months of mostly peaceful anti-Assad protests , army deserters unwilling to shoot at demonstrators have formed themselves into rebel units , of uncertain size , mostly in Syria 's agricultural heartland around the city of Homs . The area is a recruiting ground for Sunni conscripts who provide most of manpower in the military , which is dominated by officers from Assad 's minority Alawite sect , and in better equipped core units commanded by his younger brother Maher . Homs and its environs have seen some of the biggest street protests against Assad , as well as some of the heaviest assaults in a crackdown that has killed 2,700 people , by a U.N. count . `` The -LRB- army -RRB- defections are occurring in the regions where the killings are most severe . For every Syrian the regime kills , it is creating 10 opponents , '' one activist said . `` The problem is that the defectors have nowhere to go . There is no safe haven or outside backing for them , '' he said . The bulk of the armed forces has remained nominally loyal , with tight surveillance by Alawite secret police . Soldiers who disobey orders to crush protests risk being shot . Peter Harling , regional project director at the International Crisis Group , said army desertions were not a countrywide trend . Elsewhere , he said : `` People have been preparing themselves -LRB- to take up arms -RRB- but continue showing restraint . '' `` There has been a lot of talk from the opposition about militarization , but this is for now an expression of frustration more than a definite shift in strategy , '' Harling told Reuters , Citing residents , the Syrian Revolution General Commission , which groups several activist organizations , said Rastan neighborhoods had been under fire since early morning from anti-aircraft guns , tanks and armored personnel carriers . `` Two mosques were hit . Homes and clinics have been damaged , '' it said . With communications cut in the area , there were no firm reports on casualties . One local activist said on Tuesday that five civilians and rebel soldiers had been killed . In another outbreak of armed opposition to Assad , people in the nearby city of Homs said rebel soldiers had hit a government tank with a rocket-propelled grenade on Tuesday . The attack occurred in the Bayada district , home to desert tribesmen who are among Assad 's fiercest foes in the city of one million . Activists in Homs , Syria 's third largest city , said at least six inhabitants were killed in raids by security forces . Several doctors and professor have been assassinated in Homs in the past few weeks by what the authorities call `` terrorists . '' The Local Coordination Committees and other activist groups , said the authorities were behind the killings to stoke sectarian strife in the city , which has a significant Alawite minority . Syrian authorities say `` armed terrorist groups '' are responsible for civilian deaths in the past six months of unrest and have also killed 700 members of the security forces . Turkey is preparing sanctions against Syria , a former ally , in a policy shift that aligns Ankara more closely with the West and complements a Turkish arms embargo already in place . Ankara has said the sanctions , expected to be unveiled within days after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan visits border camps sheltering more than 7,000 Syrians who have fled the violence , will target Assad 's government , not the Syrian people . Officials say the measures will affect military , banking and energy ties between the formerly friendly countries . `` Turkey is reverting to the U.S. and European line on Syria , '' said foreign policy expert Semih Idiz . `` The relationship with Syria has collapsed and it is heading for a freeze . '' Britain , France , Germany and Portugal plan to circulate a draft U.N. resolution that condemns Syria , but drops calls for immediate sanctions against it , diplomats said on Tuesday . The scaled-back resolution , aimed at breaking a deadlock on the Security Council , will threaten future sanctions if Assad 's government does not halt military attacks on civilians .

The jury is out on what exactly has caused productivity to flatline for the past three years . But if the trend persists , then future quantitative easing from the Bank of England may serve only to keep inflation at more than double its two percent target , rather than boost anaemic growth . Moreover , the government might have to impose extra spending cuts or tax rises in order to slash its sky-high deficit , which weaker productivity and medium-term growth would render even less sustainable . British productivity grew by about 2.5 percent a year in the run-up to the start of the financial crisis in 2007 . In the three years since then , growth has been close to zero . Output per worker in Britain is now 13 percent below the average for other members of the G7 group of industrialised countries , the biggest shortfall since 1999 . Only Japan has a worse story to tell . This is not what economists would expect after a normal recession , during which uncompetitive businesses typically go bust and others cut costs , leaving leaner firms behind . But Britain 's recession has not been normal . Unemployment has gone up less than in other countries and in past recessions , and fewer firms have gone bankrupt . This would not necessarily be a bad thing for longer-term productivity if firms were simply holding on to staff , waiting for demand to pick up . But in a speech last week , BoE chief economist Spencer Dale said businesses were not reporting much spare capacity , and had been adding jobs despite weak growth . `` Firms in some parts of our economy are having to work flat out just to generate the same amount of business . Estate agents , for example , trying to match buyers and sellers in a thin housing market . Or M&A teams pitching for new business , '' he said . Financial services as a whole -- a major driver of productivity growth in Britain until 2007 -- are unlikely to be as significant in future , both because of their reduced size in the British economy , and because of tougher regulation that reverses the past decade 's liberalisation . Another previously highly productive sector , North Sea oil and gas , is also suffering as increasingly scarce resources become more costly to extract . And a newly conservative banking sector makes it harder for entrepreneurs to start or expand businesses . This last point was emphasised by Dale 's fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Ben Broadbent in a speech at Thomson Reuters ' London headquarters on Monday . `` As long as ... capital remains misallocated , productivity , national income and the share of it paid out as wages will all be lower than they otherwise would be , '' Broadbent said . These concerns contributed to Dale 's decision to call for higher interest rates in the first half of this year . Slow productivity growth implies that the economy has less room to grow before it starts generating excess inflation . In economists ' language , there is a smaller output gap and this may be a partial explanation for Britain 's unexpectedly sticky inflation after the credit crunch . Since then , prospects for global demand have weakened markedly , and economists polled by Reuters see a three in four chance that the Bank would start a second round of asset purchases with newly-created money . Britain 's productivity outlook will not determine that decision but it does have potential implications for QE 's effectiveness if the economy is already closing in on full capacity . `` If the patient 's in intensive care , you tend not to worry about the longer term implications of the medicine , '' said Adam Chester , an economist at Lloyds Corporate Markets . `` There is a risk that further QE is ineffective in boosting growth . It could just be effective in boosting nominal asset prices . '' Adam Posen , the most long-standing advocate of more asset purchases on the MPC , would not disagree that QE would be more effective if Britain 's banking system functioned efficiently , and has recently proposed a new state-backed bank to lend to small businesses . Other economists concerned about Britain 's productivity , such as Citi economist Michael Saunders , are more relaxed about QE 's effect on inflation , arguing that there is still sufficient spare capacity in Britain 's economy to allow growth without excess price pressures . Where weak productivity growth may pose a trickier problem is for Britain 's public finances . A central pledge of the coalition government is to eliminate the structural budget deficit within five years . Lower productivity growth translates directly into lower trend growth for Britain 's economy -- meaning a bigger chunk of Britain 's 10 percent budget deficit-to-GDP ratio must be counted as a long-term , structural issue . The government 's independent fiscal watchdog estimated in March that about a quarter of the deficit this year is down to short-term cyclical factors , and does not need specific government attention . But if the Office for Budget Responsibility decides the output gap is smaller than thought , then the structural element of the deficit would be bigger . OBR head Robert Chote hinted that this might be the case in a speech last week , when he noted that productivity was growing much slower than the 2 percent annual rate assumed in the Office for Budget Responsibility 's March fiscal forecasts . According to David Tinsley , an economist for BNP Paribas , a 1 percent productivity growth rate would be more realistic for the next 5-10 years . However , he expected the OBR to avoid dropping a political bombshell by revising down its productivity growth estimates that much -- making it easier for the government to credibly defer any extra spending cuts until the economy is on a stronger footing . `` There are a lot of gray areas in the numbers so I do n't think it will want to prompt the government into doing anything particularly drastic , '' he said . `` If it does do anything it will be a question of -LRB- the government -RRB- doing some extra implied spending restraints in 2014 and 2015 .

But on some of the most urgent issues facing the Middle East today -- Palestinian statehood and turmoil in Yemen and Syria -- the kingdom 's ageing rulers have so far abdicated a lead role and the chance to shape the region shaken by Arab uprisings . Middle Eastern diplomats have long described Saudi foreign policy as working like a searchlight : able to focus sharply on a single dominant issue , but lacking the capacity to follow up its interest when attention has moved elsewhere . `` The Saudis have historically not been grand-standers , '' said Robert Jordan , a former U.S. ambassador to Riyadh . `` They have not made grand proclamations and have preferred to work under the radar and quietly . This is still very much their style . '' Now analysts fear the growing frailty of the kingdom 's most senior leadership has diminished its diplomatic agility in a political system that relies on sustained interest from the top . The conservative Islamic state is at odds with its key U.S. ally over how to respond to Arab pro-democracy movements and appears to have ceded some regional leadership to Turkey , which has taken a strong line against Israel and the Syrian president . Used to working back channels and shunning the limelight , the kingdom has employed pocketbook diplomacy , pledging billions of dollars to Egypt and the Palestinian Authority . Underpinning Saudi concerns are its fears that the fall of established rulers after popular revolts has created strategic opportunities for Middle East rival Iran , while instability , especially in Yemen , has gifted openings to al Qaeda . `` Saudi Arabia is a status quo power in a region where the majority of Arabs oppose the status quo , '' said Shadi Hamid , director of research at Brookings Doha Centre . `` So to the extent that democratic change provides an opening for hostile forces , they oppose democracy . '' Nowhere was that more evident than in Bahrain , where Saudi forces intervened in March to help the island 's Sunni rulers crush pro-reform demonstrations backed by the Shi'ite majority . The Saudis had already been upset with the United States for failing to prevent the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , whom they had seen as a vital ally against Iran . King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud , who is in his 80s , is in poor health and can not work a full day , while Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al-Saud is abroad for medical treatment . The next most senior man , Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz al-Saud , weighs in on foreign policy , but has been unwell himself and has a different approach on some international issues , especially with veteran Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal , who is also unwell . `` King Abdullah 's the central figure and ultimately calls the shots , but he 's not in perfect health and neither are the people around him , '' said Ghanem Nuseibeh , a political analyst and partner at Cornerstone Global consultants . `` It 's not contributing to the Saudis ' ability to create a coherent policy and establish facts on the ground . The Saudi state is becoming an inactive , passive player . '' Although both King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Prince Saud have backed the Palestinian statehood claim in prepared texts released to journalists , neither read out their remarks , which could be a sign they are not pushing the matter forcefully . Indeed the king only said Riyadh would join others in support of the Palestinian bid , according to published remarks . By contrast , in 2002 King Abdullah proposed a peace plan offering Israel pan-Arab recognition in return for a Palestinian state . It was rejected by Israel , but remains the corner-stone of Arab policy on the region 's most stubborn impasse . Instead of a fresh diplomatic offensive to coincide with the request for the U.N. Security Council to recognize a Palestinian state , the kingdom has worked mostly behind the scenes . This month a senior Saudi prince wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times warning that Washington 's promised veto of the resolution would make its relationship with Riyadh `` toxic . '' Prince Turki al-Faisal , a former intelligence chief and ambassador to Washington and London , has no formal role , but his words were widely interpreted as a message from King Abdullah . Jordan , the former U.S. envoy , said the Saudis were unlikely to risk the basic relationship with the United States over any U.N vote , suggesting their leverage on that issue was limited . `` They recognize how closely vital Saudi interests are tied to vital U.S. interests on a whole range of issues from counter-terrorism to Iran and maintaining a balanced price of oil , '' he said . `` It would be almost unthinkable for there to be a major rupture such that the two countries fail to cooperate . '' Saudi policy on Yemen , where more than 100 people have been killed in a week of clashes between opponents and supporters of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , also lacks force , say analysts . Saleh spent three months in Riyadh recuperating from an assassination attempt before returning to Sanaa on Friday . Any expectation that Saleh would bow out to end the crisis roiling Yemen since protests erupted in January fell flat . He offered no concessions and no clear path to transfer power . Saudi princes have strong networks of influence throughout Yemen , which the kingdom regards as its top security risk , and have spent freely on their unruly neighbor in the past . However , while Riyadh has backed a Gulf-brokered plan for Saleh to step down , it has failed to pressure the veteran Yemeni leader to implement an orderly transfer of power . `` Yemen is a clear example of where the Saudi regime is unable to make a decision on what they want , '' said Nuseibeh , arguing that top Saudi figures supported rival Yemeni factions and did not know what to do with Saleh when he was in Riyadh . Saudi policy on Syria has also seemed half-hearted . In August , King Abdullah demanded an end to the bloodshed against protesters and withdrew his ambassador to Damascus , but has not followed through , for example by pushing for Arab League measures against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . -LRB- Editing by Reed Stevenson and Alistair Lyon -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "136", "dct": "2011-09-29", "dates": ["2011-09-29", "2011-09-29", "2012-02-01"], "text": "TAWARGHA , Libya | Thu Sep 29 , 2011 12:15 pm BST TAWARGHA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Cast out of his home and with nowhere left to flee , Aboulharef al-Tawarghy laughs when he thinks of the Libyan fighters who toppled Muammar Gaddafi calling for freedom and justice . `` Their words are just ink on paper . I have n't seen any action , '' the 29-year-old electronics dealer said as he sat near a mosque in the embattled city of Sirte , where scores of men , women and children who fled their home town of Tawargha have found a precarious refuge . The families could not go home , they said , out of fear of reprisal attacks by anti-Gaddafi fighters from nearby Misrata who have accused them of harbouring the ousted leader 's troops and committing atrocities during a brutal , months-long siege . Tawargha , once home to thousands of people , is now almost entirely deserted , its windows smashed , its stores looted and its walls speckled with gunfire . Its inhabitants have scattered across Libya , many to cities such as Benghazi and Tripoli . The fate of the town , about 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- from Misrata , has posed a disquieting challenge for Libya 's new leaders in the interim National Transitional Council NTC . L as they try to reunify the war-scarred country and impose the rule of law . Adding to the issue 's sensitivity , Tawargha 's residents are overwhelmingly black , a legacy of the town 's history as a transit point in the 19th-century slave trade , locals say . Many young fighters have treated dark-skinned people with suspicion during the revolt because of reports Gaddafi hired mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa , but the feud between Tawargha and Misrata appears to be about more than just race . The NTC 's handling of the crisis will test its ability to rein in Libya 's many largely independent militias and prevent reprisals that could fuel bloodshed and recrimination . `` Those who committed crimes should be brought to justice , but it 's important not to generalise , '' NTC spokesman Jalal al-Gallal said , adding that the council favored the return of Tawargha 's residents , but that this would take time . `` At the moment it 's a very , very sensitive topic , '' Gallal said . `` The Misratans are still simmering . '' The derogatory graffiti covering Tawargha 's walls makes it clear where many local fighters stand on the question of return . `` Tawargha , you dogs , 3,000 km this way , '' reads one message spray-painted on a road sign , beside an arrow pointing south into the Sahara desert . `` Formerly Tawargha , '' says another . Many of Tawargha 's erstwhile residents say they see little hope of returning home , partly because their dark skin makes them obvious targets for vengeful fighters in the area . `` It 's about the color of the skin . That 's why they have problems with Tawargha , '' Samia Taher , a light-skinned Libyan woman born in Illinois who married into a Tawargha family , said as she rested near the mosque where families sheltered , a couple of km -LRB- miles -RRB- from the heart of Sirte , besieged by NTC forces . She was interrupted by a burst of tank fire from a nearby hill . Women in brightly-coloured headscarves gasped and children flinched as the boom echoed through the lot , where mattresses and blankets were piled up and men rested in the shade . `` I just want to get the family out of here . We 're in the middle of a battle here in Sirte , '' Taher , speaking in American-accented English , said of the struggle for Gaddafi 's birthplace . Many NTC fighters deny their feud with Tawargha is about race . But they are openly hostile toward the town , which they say supported Gaddafi in return for money and services . Even before the war , Misrata residents disparaged Tawargha , calling its young people criminals and drug addicts , or accusing its menfolk of marrying often and working little . Scorn turned to outright hostility after Gaddafi 's forces assaulted Misrata with rockets , snipers and artillery to try to quash the uprising there in February , using Tawargha as a staging ground for a siege that killed more than 1,000 people . With the help of NATO air strikes , anti-Gaddafi rebels were able to break the siege and take control of Tawargha . The charred husks of tanks , unexploded rockets and bullet casings on the outskirts of the town testify to the battle 's ferocity . Many in Misrata accuse men from Tawargha of looting homes and raping women in Misrata during the siege , claims that are impossible to confirm , but display the depth of their enmity . As evidence , one resident offered a cell phone video he said was found on a slain Gaddafi soldier . It showed scores of black men in green military jackets with assault rifles marching down a tree-lined road he said led from Tawargha to Misrata . Tawarghy and other residents admit that support for Gaddafi ran strong in their town , but are quick to add that this does not justify demonising and punishing an entire community . Some of those who have taken refuge in cities along the Mediterranean coast say their homes in Tawargha have been burned and that relatives or neighbors have been abducted or attacked . The group of about 135 sheltering near Sirte ricocheted for months from town to town in search of a haven , only to end up in the crossfire of one of the civil war 's last battles . `` It 's all very tragic . We lack security and safety , and we have to worry about food , '' Tawarghy -- the name he gave meaning one from Tawargha -- said . `` All this and you 're calling for freedom ? What kind of freedom are you seeking ? '' Gallal , the NTC spokesman , said he expected residents who had not committed crimes to return to their homes eventually . `` The other solution would be mass relocation of people . That 's hardly an ideal solution . Things are tense at the moment , but I think in time they will fall into place , '' he said . Any such restitution is sure to be complicated . Much of Tawargha is in ruins . The charred skeletons of cars , busted electronics and garbage cover the streets between bullet-scarred apartment blocks . Goats and camels wander amid the wreckage . Green flags , a symbol of support for Gaddafi , still flutter over many buildings , more than a month after the deposed leader 's forces were pushed out of the capital , Tripoli . Despite NTC assurances , many in Misrata say it would only lead to more violence if Tawargha 's residents were allowed to return , even if some were innocent . The crimes against Misrata were just too many and too heinous , they say . `` To avoid the recurrence of any future problems , we should separate the two groups , '' said a Misrata man named Saleh as he stood near a Tawargha apartment block being used as temporary shelter for non-Tawargha families fleeing fighting in Sirte . `` They should be compensated for their land and houses , and they should find a new area to live elsewhere . '' A man standing nearby echoed that view . `` Even if someone did n't do anything , his nephew or his cousin might have . Maybe 95 percent of people in Tawargha supported Gaddafi , '' he said . `` It 's better if they find somewhere else , far from Misrata .

England are favorites to earn the two points they need from Saturday 's match to knock out their old rivals and progress to the quarter-finals as group winners . However , Scotland can qualify with a victory , depending on bonus points , on Saturday and with Argentina expected to easily beat Georgia on Sunday to go through , England could end up suffering an early group stage exit . `` It 's knockout rugby , let 's not worry about points differentials and all that , they 've got to win , we 've got to win . That 's what World Cups are all about , '' England manager Martin Johnson said after naming his team on Wednesday . The powerful Lawes , England 's enforcer on the field , comes into the side in place of Tom Palmer after serving a two-match ban for dropping his knee to the head of Argentine hooker Mario Ledesma in the opening 13-9 win . With rain expected to hamper running rugby on Saturday and Scotland having caused problems for them at the breakdown and in the scrum previously , the return of Lawes was a welcome boost for Johnson . `` Courtney has been playing well , and although he has n't played for two weeks , we 're comfortable about him coming back in and performing for us , '' Johnson said at the team 's hotel in central Auckland . Stevens returns after recovering from an ankle injury and faces a tough challenge in nullifying the threat of Scottish tighthead and renowned scrummager Euan Murray in one of the key battles on Saturday . The only other change to the side that routed Romania 67-3 in Dunedin on Saturday is in the backs , with Delon Armitage preferred on the wing to the experienced Mark Cueto , who scored a hat-trick of tries against the eastern Europeans on his return from injury . `` When Delon 's playing well and in good , top form he 's a test match player , '' Johnson said of his decision . `` Obviously the injury to Mark is a factor in that and he 's probably one game short of being right back to where he can be . `` We 're reasonably healthy , which is great at this point of the tournament , and , as ever , we thought this was the best team for this particular game . '' Scotland coach Andy Robinson named a side full of pace earlier on Thursday but admitted they would still be attacking England with forward grunt through the middle . For that reason , in-form number eight James Haskell , blindside Tom Croft and captain Lewis Moody will need to be at the best at the breakdown to counter the Scottish threat . Discipline will also be key for Johnson in what is expected to be a closely fought battle after England gave away a number of needless penalties in their opening three wins . Elsewhere in the side , Jonny Wilkinson will win his 90th cap after being named ahead of Toby Flood at flyhalf following an improved showing against Romania where he provided more of an attacking threat than in previous matches .

The existence and outline of the letter from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet and his designated successor , Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi , has been acknowledged but it has not so far been made public . In unusually clear and explicit language , Trichet and Draghi urged Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to make deep reforms including opening up public services , overhauling wage bargaining and hiring and firing rules and toughening up deficit cuts . It said the government should aim to bring the deficit down to one percent of gross domestic product by 2012 and balance the budget by 2013 , a year ahead of schedule , `` mainly via expenditure cuts . '' `` We trust the Government will take all the appropriate actions , '' it ends . After several weeks of wrangling , Berlusconi 's centre-right government passed a 60 billion euro austerity package earlier this month which contains some of the steps outlined in the letter although the erratic manner in which it was agreed drew widespread criticism . The government says it is on course to balance the budget by 2013 but expects a deficit of 1.6 percent by 2012 , well above the target in the letter , while much of the reduction has come through higher taxes . Other measures requested by the central bank , including pension reforms , cuts to public sector wages and new hiring and dismissal rules have either not been implemented or only partially addressed . Trichet has denied there was any direct deal between the ECB and the Italian government over the measures but just days after it was sent , the central bank began a controversial operation to buy Italian bonds in the market . Yields on Italy 's 10 year bonds have come down from the levels of more than 6 percent they reached before the ECB intervened but market concern has been growing and a bond auction on Thursday is expected to see 10 year yields as high as 5.9 percent . The letter said the ECB Governing Council had met on Aug 4 to discuss the sharp sell-off of Italian government bonds triggered by investor concern over the struggling government 's ability to tackle Italy 's mix of chronically weak growth and a mountainous public debt . `` The Governing Council considers that pressing action by the Italian authorities is essential to restore the confidence of investors , '' it said , adding that there was a need for `` significant measures to enhance potential growth . '' It called for full liberalisation of local public services and professional services , with `` large scale privatizations '' in the local services sector . It also urged further reforms to the collective bargaining system , allowing company-level wages and conditions agreements and a full review of hiring and firing rules in conjunction with the establishment of an unemployment insurance system . Turning to the fiscal side , the letter called on the government to bring forward measures already planned in a package of budget measures passed in July , with the aim of balancing the budget by 2013 , a year earlier than planned . It called for pension reforms , including changes to the eligibility of seniority pensions and bringing the retirement age for women in the private sector into line with the public sector with the aim of already making savings in 2012 . It also said the government should consider cutting the cost of public sector employees , by strengthening staff turnover rules and if necessary by wage cuts . It urged an automatic deficit reduction clause , ensuring any slippage from deficit targets would be automatically made up by horizontal cuts on spending and said borrowing , including by regional and local governments , should be tightly controlled . The government has announced plans for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution but the complicated rules governing the process mean it could take years to be implemented .

A statement issued in Istanbul on behalf of the newly formed National Council rejected foreign intervention that `` compromises Syria 's sovereignty '' but said the outside world had a humanitarian obligation to protect the Syrian people . `` The Council demands international governments and organizations meet their responsibility to support the Syrian people , protect them and stop the crimes and gross human rights violations being committed by the illegitimate current regime , '' the statement said . The declaration and support for the National Council was a significant show of unity from the Syrian opposition after six months of mostly non-violent protests against President Bashar al-Assad have begun to be overtaken by more violent resistance . Armed insurgents , mostly in the central Homs region and in the northwestern province of Idlib near Turkey , have been so far outgunned . The official Syrian news agency said Saturday government forces had regained control of the central town of Rastan , after the most prolonged fighting yet between the army and insurgents who are led , according to residents , by army defectors . But underlining the more violent turn , Syrian authorities said that the son of Syria 's Mufti , who is appointed by Assad , was assassinated Sunday . It was the first attack against the state-backed Sunni clergy who have been a base of support for Assad 's ruling Alawite elite for decades . In Istanbul , the National Council said that the uprising must remain peaceful but that military assaults on numerous towns and villages , torture and mass arrests were driving Syria `` to the edge of civil war and inviting foreign interference . '' It also said the Muslim Brotherhood , the Damascus Declaration - the main grouping of established opposition figures - and grassroots activists all had joined the National Council . While few expect a Libya-style intervention in Syria , the declaration was nonetheless a way for the opposition to shake off its image of in-fighting and lack of cohesive leadership . `` The fact that Islamists , secular figures and activists on the ground are now on one council is a significant , '' a diplomat in the Syrian capital Damascus said . `` But they still have to demonstrate that they could be politically savvy and able to fill any political vacuum . They need a detailed action plan beyond the generalities of wanting a democratic Syria . '' The United Nations says 2,700 people , including 100 children , have been killed in six months of protests against Assad , whose Alawite minority sect - a Shi'ite offshoot - dominates the mostly Sunni Muslim country of 20 million . The 46-year old president , who inherited power from his father in 2000 , blames the violence on armed gangs backed by foreign forces , while his officials say 700 police and soldiers have been killed , as well as 700 `` mutineers . '' The government has dismissed the opposition organizing outside Syria as a foreign conspiracy to sow sectarian strife . The state news agency said `` armed terrorist groups '' killed five members of the security police in the Ghab region west of the city of Hama and used explosives to derail a freight train in the province of Idlib Sunday . It also said that Sariya Hassoun , the son of Mufti Ahmad Hassaoun , who is officially considered the highest religious authority in Syria , was assassinated in Idlib . Idlib , together with the central region around the town of Rastan on the Orontes River , 110 miles north of Damascus , have seen some of the biggest protests against Assad , followed by a fierce crackdown and fighting between loyalist forces and defectors and other insurgents . The two regions are a main reservoir of Sunni recruits to the military , which is led by mostly Alawite officers . Local activists said troops backed by tanks raided villages and towns looking for army defectors around Rastan Sunday , with tens of villagers arrested in the Houla and Talbiseh region , and the villages of al-Zafaran and Deir al-Foul . One activist said security forces killed three civilians on Sunday in the town of Khan Sheikhoun north of Rastan . He said that among them was activist Mohammad Tellawi , 35 , whose brother Mukhles was also killed three months ago . ISLAMISTS , SECULARISTS , CHRISTIANS AND KURDS The Istanbul declaration was read out by Bourhan Ghalioun , a secular professor of politics living in France . He was flanked by Islamists , including Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammad Riad al-Shaqfa , Christian and Kurdish politicians and Samir Nashar , a member of the Damascus Declaration . Among those represented in the Damascus Declaration are former parliamentarian Riad Seif , seen as possibly playing a leadership role if Assad were to fall , and Riad al-Turk , Syria 's top dissident . Turk , 81 , but still operating underground , has moral authority over the diverse opposition , having spent 25 years in jail as a political prisoner , including almost 18 in solitary confinement . France has already publicly supported the National Council , but it has not yet won endorsement from the United States or Syria 's powerful neighbor Turkey , which has been enraged by what it describes as brutal killings south of its border . Assad has relied on Russia and China , which have major oil concessions in Syria and do not want to see Western influence in the Middle East spread , to block western proposals for United Nations Security Council sanctions on Damascus . The European members of the Security Council have been working in recent days to persuade Russia to accept a watered-down resolution on Syria that would threaten `` targeted measures '' against Damascus if it fails to end its crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators without explicitly threatening U.N. sanctions , Council diplomats said . European envoys say that they hope the Council will vote on the Syria resolution Tuesday . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

Today , it 's poised to do the same for corn . The world 's most populous nation is expected to triple corn purchases next crop year and , by its own admission , become a significant importer by 2015 , putting more strain on global food supplies at a time when inflation is gnawing away at economic growth and the population nears seven billion . China has become the dominant force in the global soybean market since emerging as a buyer in the early 1990s . It is now the world 's biggest importer and consumer , taking in some 55 million tonnes , or 60 percent of annual global trade . If the soybean scenario is a precedent for corn -- and traders say all the signs point in that direction -- benchmark corn prices in the United States , the biggest producer , could in the long term exceed the $ 8 a bushel record set in June . U.S. stockpiles are expected to fall to their lowest levels in 16 years in 2011\\/12 , an ominous sign of how China 's rising imports will squeeze supply . Demand for the grain , crucial to fatten the animals that feed the world 's growing hunger for meat , shows no sign of abating . Competition for supplies with Japan , the world 's biggest corn importer , will intensify and farmers from as far away as Argentina will start planting more acreage while the amount of corn used to make biofuels could shrink . Driving this seismic change in the corn industry is a fifth of the world 's population , which has developed a voracious appetite for pork , poultry and eggs that China 's government is striving to make affordable . For Beijing , high food prices are a potential trigger for social unrest it wants to avoid . `` There are shifting diet patterns with growing wealth and the middle class in China together with climate change , land degradation and water scarcity , '' said Monika Barthwal-Datta , who heads the food security program at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney . `` It means China is going to enter the market in a substantial manner and it is going to compete with other countries in the region that rely on U.S. corn . '' Grain stocks and demand are politically charged topics in the world 's second largest economy , and biggest pork consumer , which is particularly conscious about its food security . Last year , China returned to importing corn in earnest after years of blocking foreign grain , buying a record 1.57 million tonnes , up 18 times from the previous year , because domestic production just could n't keep up . China is likely to boost imports to four million tonnes in the 2011\\/12 crop year beginning October from an estimated 1.3 million this year , a Reuters poll showed . Imports could be even higher , with one analyst forecasting China could ask for as much as 9 million tonnes , which would put it on par with Mexico , the world 's second biggest importer . Corn , and to a lesser extent wheat , are mainly used as animal feed . But with strong domestic demand eating up what is forecast to be a bumper harvest , and state reserves running low , corn prices have shot up in China , stoking pork prices that in turn have helped propel overall inflation to a three-year high of 6.5 percent in July . An analyst with the China National Grain and Oils Information Centre , a state-run think-tank , said consumption would continue to dwarf domestic supply as the scope to increase production remained limited . A bad year for farmers could boost China 's growing dependence on international markets . `` If the weather is not good in some years , the deficit will be bigger , '' he said . Because of their market dominance , any changes to the food patterns in the United States or China will have big repercussions for the rest of the world , and grain prices . `` Imagine if China gets slightly lesser production , it could translate into additional imports and it is exactly the same situation for the United States , '' said Abdolreza Abbassian , grain analyst at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation . China is currently the world 's second biggest corn consumer . Significant Chinese imports would bolster prices , said Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney . After falling from their record high in June , prices remain largely unchanged this year , compared with almost 20 percent losses in wheat and a nearly 13 percent decline in soybeans . `` The explosion in Chinese imports from 1990 through today has certainly been a key driver in the oilseed market and we think a repeat of that in the corn market would certainly be a very supportive influence on world prices , '' Mathews said . Relentless demand has also driven China 's domestic corn prices to an all-time high this month , depleting reserves to less than one month 's supply and worrying a government desperate to control food prices , which on average jumped more than 13 percent in August . LARGE PIG FARMS , ETHANOL INDUSTRY Official fears about food inflation are largely behind China 's drive to transform the hog industry from backyard farms to large modern complexes that will require more corn to ensure steady pork supplies . `` When you are a backyard farm you can replace corn with some cheap feed input like waste but you take longer to rear pigs , '' said Jean-Yves Chow , a senior industry analyst at Rabobank in Hong Kong . `` When you turn to the industrialised model you have a feeding program which is more based on corn and soybean meal and it is pretty much fixed . '' Rabobank estimates that by 2015 , nearly three-quarters of the pigs in China will be reared in commercial farms compared with 63 percent in 2010 . In 2000 , farms with more than 50 pigs constituted just 26 percent of the output . Going beyond its borders , China 's large corn imports could also threaten feed grain supplies for the U.S. ethanol industry , which consumes 40 percent of the country 's corn output . In drawing up its balance sheet , the U.S. Department of Agriculture has already said that corn for ethanol would drop 100 million bushels in 2011\\/12 to 5 billion bushels from its August forecast . Tightening corn supplies will make for a more competitive environment and could put some plants at risk even though at this point production levels continue to run strong . `` If you see rising demand from food and feed sectors then subsidies on ethanol production in the U.S. do n't make sense at all , '' said Datta . `` Focus on biofuels from food grains is quite a dangerous one .

The October 5-13 `` mobilization '' exercise , announced on the military 's website on Tuesday , may coincide with a visit that Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan is expected to make to refugee camps in Hatay after he returns from South Africa this week . The army said the exercise would involve the 39th mechanized infantry brigade and 730 reserve soldiers . Turkey 's once-close relations with Syria have soured as Erdogan has fiercely criticized Assad 's crackdown on protesters , urging him to end the bloodshed and enact reforms . Syria has a longstanding territorial claim to Hatay province , but had put this on the back burner in recent years , when Erdogan and Assad cultivated close ties . Erdogan said last month that Assad would be ousted by his people `` sooner or later '' and warned that Syria could slide into a sectarian civil war between Alawites and Sunnis . Most Syrians , like most Turks , are Sunni Muslims , while Assad is from the minority Alawite Muslim sect . Ankara , which has already imposed an arms embargo , has said it is preparing further sanctions against the Syrian government . The Hatay exercise may revive speculation , denied by officials , that Turkey plans to create a buffer zone in Syria to protect civilians and prevent a flood of refugees to Turkey . Syrian refugee numbers have remained relatively low and Erdogan is under little public pressure to take decisive action . During the 1991 Gulf War , about half a million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey , returning only after Western powers , along with Turkish contingents , set up a safe haven across the border . Syria and Turkey almost went to war in the late 1990s when Damascus was sheltering Turkish Kurd guerrillas . Syria 's old claim to Hatay has bedeviled relations with Turkey . After the Ottoman Empire collapsed in World War One , the province passed to French mandate Syria . Syria gained independence in 1936 , but Hatay became part of Turkey in 1939 . Erdogan was reported to have reached an understanding with Assad in the mid-2000s whereby Syria would drop its claim on Hatay in return for enhanced trade and water rights from Turkey , but neither side has formally acknowledged any such agreement . With relations again chilly , Turkey has hosted several meetings of Syrian opposition groups , including one at the weekend where a broad-based Syrian National Council was formed . The council , grouping Assad 's secular and Islamist foes , said the world was obliged to protect the Syrian people , but it rejected foreign intervention that harmed Syrian sovereignty . -LRB- Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Alistair Lyon -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "291", "dct": "2011-10-04", "dates": ["2011-10-04", "2011-10-04", "2011-01-01", "1959-01-01", "1981-01-01", "1986-01-01", "2002-01-01", "2004-01-01", "1998-01-01", "1967-02-01", "1989-01-01", "1992-01-01", "1993-01-01", "1994-01-01", "1998-01-01", "1995-01-01", "2000-01-01", "1969-12-01", "1996-01-01", "1999-01-01", "1992-01-01", "1996-01-01", "1998-01-01", "2002-01-01", "2006-01-01"], "text": "Tue Oct 4 , 2011 6:30 pm BST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 was awarded `` for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae '' with one half to Saul Perlmutter and the other half jointly to Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess . For almost a century , the Universe has been known to be expanding as a consequence of the Big Bang about 14 billion years ago . However , the discovery that this expansion is accelerating is astounding . If the expansion continues to speed up , the Universe will end frozen , the prize committee said . Here are some details about the winners : -- Born in 1959 in the United States , Perlmutter is professor of Physics at the University of California , Berkeley , and senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . -- Perlmutter graduated from Harvard magna cum laude in 1981 , and received his PhD from the University of California , Berkeley , in 1986 . He was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2002 . -- He joined the University of California , Berkeley , Physics Department in 2004 . He is also an astrophysicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and leader of the international Supernova Cosmology Project , which first announced the results in 1998 indicating that the universe will last forever , with its expansion ever accelerating . -- The Supernova Cosmology Project -LRB- SCP -RRB- studies type Ia supernovae to map out the expansion history of the universe and measure cosmological parameters and the dark energy 's equation of state . -- Schmidt , born in February 1967 in Montana , is a Federation Fellow at the Australian National University 's Mount Stromlo Observatory , Canberra . -- He received undergraduate degrees in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Arizona in 1989 , and his Master 's degree -LRB- 1992 -RRB- and PhD -LRB- 1993 -RRB- in Astronomy from Harvard University . -- In 1994 he formed the HighZ SN Search team , a group of 20 astronomers on five continents who used distant exploding stars to trace the expansion of the Universe back in time . -- This group 's discovery of an accelerating Universe was named Science Magazine 's Breakthrough of the Year for 1998 . -- Schmidt joined the staff of the Australian National University in 1995 , and was awarded the Australian Government 's inaugural Malcolm McIntosh award for achievement in the Physical Sciences in 2000 . -- Schmidt has continued to work on using exploding stars to study the Universe , and is leading Mount Stromlo 's effort to build the SkyMapper telescope , a new facility that will provide a comprehensive digital map of the southern sky from ultraviolet through near infrared wavelengths . -- Riess , born in December 1969 in Washington , D.C. , is an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore . -- From 1996-1999 , Riess was a Miller Fellow at the University of California , Berkeley . Riess qualified in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992 where he was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society . -- He received his PhD from Harvard University in 1996 . -- In 1998 Riess led a study for the High-z Team which provided the first direct and published evidence that the expansion of the Universe was accelerating . -- He followed this work with a number of studies to test the susceptibility of this measurement to contamination by unexpected types of dust or evolution . To this aim , Riess led the Hubble Higher-z Team beginning in 2002 to find 25 of the most distant supernovae known with the Hubble Space Telescope . -- In 2006 Riess , together with Perlmutter and Schmidt , were awarded the $ 1 million Shaw Prize in astronomy , for their discovery of the mysterious `` dark energy '' that is causing the universe to expand at an ever-faster rate .

Subsidising the cost of fuel , mainly diesel , petrol and kerosene , costs the government 1.2 trillion naira -LRB- $ 7.5 billion -RRB- in lost revenues but removing the support will be unpopular with many Nigerians who see it as the only benefit they gain from living in an oil-rich country . Previous efforts to remove subsidies have resulted in nationwide strike action in Africa 's most populous nation , where most people live on less than $ 2 a day . There have been several protests this year in anticipation of deregulation . `` A major component of the policy of fiscal consolidation is the government 's intent to phase out the fuel subsidy beginning from 2012 fiscal year , '' said a 2012-2015 Medium Term Fiscal Framework -LRB- MTFF -RRB- and Medium Term Expenditure Framework -LRB- MTEF -RRB- paper . `` This will free up about 1.2 trillion naira in savings , part of which can be deployed into providing safety nets for poor segments of society to ameliorate the effects of the subsidy removal , '' the federal government document said . The document is with the national assembly . How quickly lawmakers pass the plans will give an indication of how soon and the next budget will be ready for implementation . The 2011 budget process was chaotic after lawmakers inflated spending plans before the president reduced them again , finally passing the budget in May . Finance Minister and Coordinator of the Economy , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , has pledged to avoid the problems of the 2011 budget by getting the spending plans organised earlier . The fiscal strategy paper hints that the government will forward a 4.8 trillion naira budget for 2012 to the national assembly later this month , up from around 4.5 trillion in this year 's budget passed in May . Nigeria only spends around a quarter of its budget on capital expenditure , meaning most of the billions of dollars it earns in oil revenues are spent keeping its government running . However , capital expenditure looks set to rise slightly to 1.32 trillion naira in 2012 as a component of the overall budget , while this should improve as overhead allocations are to be frozen until 2015 , the documents showed . `` Although aggregate expenditure is expected to increase from 4.8 trillion in 2012 to 5.18 trillion in 2015 , concerted efforts are being made to make savings from overheads as allocations will be frozen till 2015 , '' it said . Okonjo-Iweala will need to persuade lawmakers to get the budget passed when it arrives at the national assembly but they have previously fought hard to defend recurrent expenditure levels , some of which make up their large wages and expenses . The former World Bank chief has pledged to keep the fiscal deficit under 3 percent and if the MTFF is adhered to the deficit would be reduced to 2.69 percent next year . `` The Increase in capital expenditure is a welcome development , given the excesses of the recent past , in which recurrent spending was increased greatly , to the detriment of Nigeria 's oil savings and wider macroeconomic stability , '' said Razia Khan , Head of Africa Research at Standard Chartered . `` Even more positive is the proposal to remove the fuel subsidy put to national assembly . The subsidy was expensive , responsible for significant distortions and rent-seeking opportunities in the Nigerian economy , with little overall benefit . '' The 2012 budget will be based on the assumption of an ambitious average oil production of 2.48 million barrels per day and a benchmark price LCOc1 of $ 75 dollars per barrel . Nigeria 's current oil output is around 2.5 million bpd and the projections leave little room for maneuver should Nigeria suffer outages , common in the past , while global economic uncertainty by no means guarantees oil prices will stay high . -LRB- $ 1 = 159.300 Nigerian Nairas -RRB- -LRB- Additional reporting and writing by Joe Brock ; editing by Ron Askew -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "329", "dct": "2011-10-05", "dates": ["2011-10-05", "2011-10-05", "2011-10-05", "2011-10-04", "2011-03-01", "2011-01-01", "2011-10-02", "2011-09-01", "2011-10-04", "2010-01-01", "2011-10-05", "2011-09-01", "2011-07-01"], "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Oct 5 , 2011 7:49 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey said on Wednesday it would impose sanctions on Syria despite the blocking of any U.N. measures against President Bashar al-Assad for his crackdown on dissent . Russia and China handed Assad a diplomatic victory on Tuesday by vetoing a Western-backed U.N. resolution that could have led to U.N. sanctions on Damascus , but Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan promised action of his own . `` Naturally the veto ... can not prevent sanctions , '' Erdogan said . `` We will of necessity implement a package of sanctions . '' Erdogan , who is visiting South Africa , has said he will announce the package after he visits a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey in the next few days . The double veto by Moscow and Beijing infuriated Western powers which have already imposed their own sanctions on Syria and were trying to pave the way for a U.N. embargo , and will reinforce Assad 's hold on power -- at least in the short term . `` This is a sad day for the Syrian people . It 's a sad day for the Security Council , '' France 's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . Germany also expressed disappointment . A government spokesman said the draft resolution would have been an important signal of support for many Syrians `` who for months have been taking to the streets for political freedom . '' Syria 's state news agency SANA said Damascus welcomed the veto . `` It restores hope for a balanced world ... after a long time of American and European domination which turned the Security Council 's resolutions into a tool for punishing defenders of independence and liberation , '' SANA said . The draft resolution received nine votes in favor and four abstentions . U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Washington was outraged and called for `` tough targeted sanctions '' on Damascus . Russia 's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Moscow rejected the threat of sanctions on Syria and China 's envoy Li Baodong said Beijing opposed `` interference in -LRB- Syria 's -RRB- internal affairs . '' Russia has close ties with Assad 's government , which has been a client for arms sales , and has a naval maintenance facility on Syria 's Mediterranean coast . Beijing and Moscow , which had voiced concern that the draft could pave the way for Libya-style military intervention , also want to limit Western influence in the Middle East , while the United States and Europe have long sought to loosen Syria 's alliance with Iran . Assad has used tanks and troops to crush an uprising which erupted in March , inspired by regional revolts which toppled three North African leaders this year . The United Nations says 2,700 civilians have been killed . Damascus blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups which it says have killed at least 700 security personnel . Syria 's economy is reeling from the impact of the unrest and U.S. and European sanctions on the small but key oil sector . Assad faces a more united opposition after groups in exile came together in Istanbul on Sunday to call for his downfall , but the U.N. vote marks a setback to his opponents who had hoped for an escalation in international pressure on Damascus . `` We deeply regret the positions of Russia and China toward the resolution , '' said Omar Idlibi of the grassroots Local Coordination Committee in Beirut , adding he had `` not lost hope in the international community . '' Idlibi said the opposition was studying options including a general strike or civil disobedience campaign , but analysts said Assad did not look threatened in the immediate future . `` The mere fact that Assad can avoid international sanctions for the time being reinforces his position in the short term , '' said Ayham Kamel from the Eurasia thinktank . `` Assad is going to remain in power in the near term . I do n't think there are signs of imminent collapse but Syria faces challenges across the country -- the economy , insecurity across the country , and a more organized opposition . '' Syria banned most imports last month to try and conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves , but rescinded the measure on Tuesday after a spike in prices and disquiet among an influential merchant class that has been backing Assad . Turkish sanctions could also have a major impact . But Turkish officials have made clear that any measures will target Assad 's government and not the Syrian people . For this reason Turkey has ruled out cutting off electricity sales or reducing the flow of water in the Euphrates river into Syria . Bilateral trade between Turkey and Syria was worth $ 2.5 billion in 2010 , and Turkish firms had investments of $ 260 million in Syria One target of sanctions is likely to be Syria 's state banking system , which could effectively block purchases of Syrian crude oil . Other possible measures could freeze Turkish cooperation in oil and gas projects involving state-run firms . State television broadcast an interview on Wednesday with a young woman who denied reports by rights groups last month that she had been killed and mutilated , possibly in state custody . The mother of Zainab al-Hosni , 18 , from the city of Homs , confirmed that the woman on television was her daughter , who was reported to have killed after disappearing in July , Human Rights Watch said . `` We spoke to the family and they were able to confirm that the person who appeared on TV was Zainab , '' said Nadim Houry of HRW in Beirut . `` The mother said she was her daughter . '' Hosni became an icon for the Syrian revolt against Assad after the body of a badly burned , decapitated woman was found in a morgue by Hosni 's family , according to reports by HRW and Amnesty International . After months of peaceful protests , some army deserters and dissidents have taken up arms , prompting military operations against them , especially in areas bordering Turkey and Jordan . Colonel Riad al-Asaad , a Syrian officer who defected and fled to Turkey , said last week 10,000 soldiers had deserted , but authorities have denied any army defections , saying the military operations were a response to appeals by residents . Assad retains control of the military , whose mostly Sunni Muslim rank and file are largely commanded by officers of his minority Alawite sect . Syria has mostly closed its doors to independent media , making it hard to verify events , but a trickle of desertions appears to have gathered pace in the last several weeks .

Armstrong , whose London-based firm manages 251 million pounds in assets , said the telecoms , healthcare and utilities sectors had been hit by `` indiscriminate selling '' by index investors , and said he had added to telecoms holdings on Tuesday . `` Investors are destroying the real value of their wealth with bonds which yield significantly less than inflation , '' Armstrong , who is joint managing partner and head of investment selection at the firm , said in an interview late on Tuesday . `` We expect a rotation out of these bonds into high-yielding equities , which have stable earnings and cash flows , '' he said . According to Armstrong , Western economies are heading for stagflation -- an unhealthy mix of economic stagnation and inflation -- as governments and central banks continue to try to revive their flagging economies . This is set to make government bonds -- in which investors have taken refuge from this summer 's financial market woes -- less attractive , he said . German 10-year bond yields have dropped below 1.8 percent from above 3 percent at end-June , while 10-year Treasury yields have fallen to less than 1.9 percent from 3.2 percent .

ZURICH | Thu Oct 6 , 2011 3:22 pm BST ZURICH -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Stiff competition for top private bankers has kept a floor under pay even as low interest rates , flaccid client trading and tougher regulation squeeze industry profit margins . Sky-high pay and bonuses for investment bank counterparts may once have turned private bankers green with envy . But the drive to slash wage bills and rein in risk has made investment bankers expendable as many banks realign their business around more stable private banking . `` Pay was never extreme in private banking -- it 's not as subject to a correction as in investment banking , '' Deutsche Bank global head of private wealth management Pierre de Weck told the Reuters Wealth Summit this week . Stricter rules on capital have curbed profits in many areas of investment banking and a number of large integrated banks like UBS and Bank of America have pledged to cut back on capital guzzling businesses and shrink staff numbers , piling downward pressure on pay . But in private banking , competition remains hot for advisers who can bring in a good portfolio of clients , helping sustain pay , said James Fleming , head of international private banking at RBS unit Coutts & Co. `` The war for talent is not quite the 100 years war but certainly 15 years , '' Fleming said at the Reuters Summit . `` Experience shows high compensation is a key part of retention , but also tools to do the job properly , and working for a brand that 's forward thinking and progressive and providing good service for the client base . '' Remuneration is by far the biggest cost center , well ahead of premises and technology , said Alexandre Zeller , head of Private banking , EMEA at HSBC , adding that banks have to put time and effort into finding the right people to serve its clients . `` The value of staff in our business is actually extremely high , '' said de Weck . `` When we make a new hire it takes 2.5 to three years for them to become productive . But the penalty for making the wrong pay decision in our business is very high . '' Bankers at the Reuters summit generally confirmed their commitment to their businesses in Switzerland , although they said the strong Swiss franc was limiting profitability . As competition limits growth in developed markets , the fight for staff was intensifying in higher-growth areas like Singapore . De Weck said these factors have pushed the cost of Asian bankers higher than in Switzerland , while in London staff costs are about the same . The business remains centered around people and relationships and downward pressure on costs can have only a limited effect on pay scales , said Pablo Garnica , European head of JP Morgan 's private bank . `` You need to reward people to incentivize people to grow , '' Garnica said . `` At the end of the day you need to have the people capable of dealing with clients and complex situations .

Prime Minister Najib Razak also handed out cash payments to the poor , raised civil servants ' pay and opened up 17 service subsectors to foreign investors , with domestic demand targeted to be the key driver of the economy as a possible global recession clouds the outlook . `` Global developments would certainly have a direct impact on the Malaysian economy , '' Najib , who is also Finance Minister , said as he presented the 2012 budget in parliament . `` With these developments the government will put in place measures to stimulate domestic economic activities , in particular public and private investments . '' The government also allocated 2 billion ringgit of infrastructure projects for bumiputras , most of whom are ethnic Malays . It offered tax breaks for Islamic bond issuance , raised civil servant pensions and announced that it would list the global arm of its plantation group FELDA . Najib forecast that the economy would grow 5-6 percent in 2012 , while the fiscal deficit would fall further on the strength of robust domestic demand and commodities exports . Reflecting the downdraft on Asia from the slowdown in the United States and Europe , the government trimmed its 2011 economic growth target to 5.0-5 .5 percent from 5.0-6 .0 percent earlier . Its fiscal deficit will shrink further to 4.7 percent of gross domestic product next year from 5.4 percent in 2011 as it reduces development spending , confirming an earlier Reuters report . -LRB- ID : Analysts said the 2012 spending plan was tailored to woo voters , particularly the majority ethnic Malays whose support is split between Najib and the opposition . `` This a populist budget , he is trying to be popular with everyone , give goodies here and there so everyone wo n't do too badly , '' said James Chin , a political analyst at Monash University in Malaysia . `` What is surprising is the allocation to bumiputras . This was what Malay rights groups have been clamouring for but it 's a smaller allocation as they asked for 30 percent of the project . He is definitely trying to shore up ethnic Malay support .

Colonel Riad al-As ` aad , who is now living under Turkish government protection in Hatay province on the Syrian border , said some 15,000 soldiers , including officers , had already deserted , and he was waiting to move his command inside Syria . As ` aad , A slim , softly-spoken man dressed in civilian clothes and open-collared shirt , said rebel soldiers were forming brigades around the country who were setting up ambushes against government forces to prevent them entering villages . Morale in the Syrian army , he said , was low . `` Without a war , he will not fall . Whoever leads with force , can not be removed except by force , '' As ` aad told Reuters in a Syrian refugee camp in Hatay . `` The regime used a lot of oppressive and murderous tactics so I left , so that I will be the face outside for the command inside , because we have to be in a secure area and right now there is no safety in all of Syria , '' he said . As ` aad sat in the shade of a tree as Syrian refugee children laughed and played in the background . Music rang out from a nearby tent that served as a makeshift school . Like most of the military , al-As ` aad is Sunni Muslim ; but the command is in the hands of officers from Assad 's Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam that also dominates the security apparatus and the ruling elite in the majority Sunni country . As ` aad , who has been in Turkey for more than two months , is under constant guard by Turkey 's gendarmerie and his exact location is kept secret for his own security . `` We 're in contact with defectors on a daily basis . We coordinate on a daily basis with officers . Our plan is to move to Syria . We 're waiting to find a safe place which we can turn into a leadership base in Syria , '' he said . Damascus portrays the rebel soldiers as traitors serving the enemies of Syria . Some of the fighting has come close to the Turkish border and there has been speculation in Turkish media that if the flow of refugees became too great , Ankara could impose a ` buffer zone ' on the Syrian side of the frontier -- something it did in northern Iraq in the 1990s . Turkey denies any such plans . Turkey 's open harboring of As ` aad marks a further sharpening of its attitude toward President Bashar al-Assad , whom it had long seen as an ally . Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has called for Assad to go and is drawing up sanctions that could hit the Syrian economy hard . He is expected to fly down to the Syrian border soon to make a speech at a refugee camp for Syrians fleeing fighting . Graying and clean-shaven , except for a mustache , As ` aad reflected on the situation inside Syria , painting a picture of movement to and fro across the border . `` The army officer comes here only if he 's reached the stage of death or if he 's in very serious danger , so he is forced to enter Turkey . sometimes they do n't stay for too long and then re-enter Syria , depending on the security situation . '' `` Today there was an attack on Jabal al-Zawi and the Ghab region and military jets bombarded civilians who had escaped to the mountains . Until now three have been martyred , and 27 are missing . I have the names of the martyrs , '' he said , pulling out a folded piece of paper with three names scribbled in Arabic . The 50-year-old colonel , who served as an engineer in Syria 's air force for 31 years , said the Syrian government had started to harass him and other officers when pro-democracy protests first started in Tunisia . `` During the revolution in Tunisia , the regime started getting ready . It felt there will be a revolution in Syria . So it -LRB- stepped up security -RRB- , hired spies to harass us . We were always under surveillance , '' he said . As ` aad said he was summoned to the air force intelligence department in Aleppo where he was coerced into confessing there were armed groups among his relatives because there were demonstrations in his village . It was after this that he deserted . As ` aad says he commands the Syrian Free Army , which he helped form after his defection and that they had joined forces with another rebel force , the Free Officers movement , which activists have said is led by Lieutenant Abdelrahman Sheikh inside Syria . `` We 're all one group , we 're all one army . We 're all waiting , the defecting brothers are working inside , '' he said . As ` aad said 10-15 ,000 soldiers , out of the roughly 200,000-strong military , had defected all over the country and that desertions were continuing every day . `` The Syrian army 's morale is tired . Defections are happening daily . there are several units that have lost their function because of the defections , '' he said . `` The regime is weakening and the biggest proof , is that they 're using air support in addition to tanks and artillery , that proves their weakness . '' Some opponents of Assad argue resistance should remain peaceful and that armed action could only worsen the situation . `` WE WILL FIGHT WITH OUR NAILS '' There are fears , including in Turkey , that an escalation of violence in Syria , particularly with an armed opposition , may lead to a sectarian civil war . But As ` aad said while Assad 's rule was discriminatory , it would not lead to sectarian war . `` The regime depends on a sect ... and it is a sectarian and discriminatory regime . But our people are wiser than that . All Syrians are one people , whether Alawite , Druze or Christian or even the Kurds . We respect them we consider them our family , '' he said . There had so far been no defections from Syria 's political elite as happened in Libya , As ` aad said , because they were tied too closely through economic interests or positions . As ` aad said he did not want to see any foreign soldiers in Syria but that the international community should provide the rebels with weapons and enforce a no-fly zone . `` If they do n't give it to us , we will fight with our nails until the regime is toppled .

Turkey has shifted , in the space of six months , from being Syria 's new best friend forever to a center of gravity for opposition to President Bashar al-Assad outside the country . Having started out by advising Assad to exercise restraint and make reforms when pro-democracy unrest first erupted in March , Turkey is now on the verge of invoking sanctions against a government it once sat down with for joint cabinet meetings . Syrian dissidents abroad , and some who have managed to sneak out of the country , have flocked to Istanbul over the past few months to give the revolution a united political front . And Turkey has given sanctuary to the most senior Syrian military officer to defect , while this week it began maneuvers in a province over which Syria has had longstanding claims . `` Turkey is clearly taking sides now , '' said Cengiz Aktar , professor at Istanbul 's Bahcesehir University . `` Turkey expects this opposition and the upheaval in the country will eventually finish the job and the revolution will bring an end to the regime . '' But Turkey 's policy shift , which has aligned Ankara more closely with the West , comes with risks . `` Syrian intelligence might use every opportunity to instigate Kurdish violence , '' Aktar said , referring to Turkey 's restive minority population . Aktar said Turkey , whose clout in the Middle East has grown out of a combination of economic growth and secular democracy , could see goodwill evaporate if it is perceived to be meddling in Syria . `` At the end of the day , Turkey risks being told to mind its own business and to first put its house in order . The more it wants to be a soft power the more it is going to be told by the international community to apply the same standards with its Kurds minority . '' For all their closeness over the past decade , the two countries almost went to war in the late 1990s over Syria giving refuge to Kurdish militants fighting the Turkish state . Living under Turkish protection , Syrian Colonel Riad al-As ` aad exhorts his former comrades to desert to organize the armed struggle he believes is needed to drive Assad from power . `` We assure them -LRB- the Syrian people -RRB- they should be patient , and God willing , very soon , Bashar will be between their hands , '' As ` aad told Reuters in an interview on Thursday . -LRB- nL5E7L642X -RRB- `` We must be patient . We hope the Syrian people will be stronger and remain committed to continue to bring down the regime . '' Revolted by the killing of Syrian civilians , and seeing the tide of history turn with the `` Arab Spring '' of popular uprisings , Turkey has calculated that its long term interest lies in supporting the Syrian people 's struggle for democracy . That Syria , like Turkey , has a Sunni Muslim majority , while Assad and his clique belong to the Alawite minority , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , made that choice even simpler . The breakdown in their relationship leaves Iran as Syria 's closest backer , though the Russian and Chinese vetoes earlier this week of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution censuring Syria showed Assad retains some support elsewhere . Anti-Assad factions meeting in Istanbul -- ranging from Islamists through liberals , along with ethnic and tribal leaders -- have coalesced under a revolutionary Syrian National Council with a stated aim of ousting Assad within six months . Offering itself as a potential future interim government , this broad-based opposition group has helped instill some confidence among governments , like Turkey , who disapprove of Assad but had not known who to support . Hitherto , they have feared Assad 's fall would leave Syria without a central authority capable of stopping the country sliding into religious , sectarian and ethnic violence . One Western diplomat , asked about Turkey 's hesitation in the past to ditch Assad , said Ankara had come to see Assad as `` the devil we know . '' Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who had previously enjoyed a close rapport with Assad , is expected to visit a camp in the border province of Hatay sheltering some of the 7,500 Syrians who have fled the violence at home . Due to the death of his mother , Erdogan delayed a visit that had been set for Sunday , but he has already promised to announce sanctions against the Syrian government . Turkey is expected to freeze bank accounts held by members of Assad 's inner circle , cut ties with Syrian state banks , and halt deals between state-run companies , notably in oil and gas , while avoiding measures that could hurt the people . Erdogan predicted last month that Assad will be ousted `` sooner or later , '' but how far he is willing to go to make it happen is an open question . `` What we have at the moment ... is a war of words between Assad and Erdogan , '' said Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul-based security analyst . `` It 's a bit like two jilted lovers , because they were very , very close . There is a lot of personal spite . '' Compounding tensions this week , Turkey began military exercises in Hatay province , which Syria has had longstanding claims over since it was ceded to Turkey in 1939 when France controlled Syria and Lebanon . The exercises , relatively small-scale logistical drills involving a large contingent of less experienced reservist troops , are seen as a symbolic reminder to Damascus that the second largest army in NATO is just across the border . `` It is part of the Turkish government 's campaign to apply increased psychological pressure on the regime in Damascus because previous warnings have gone unheeded , '' said Fadi Hakura , analyst at Chatham House think-tank in London . Turkey has begun intercepting arms bound for Syria passing through its waters and air space . Some analysts say it is easy to foresee Turkey eventually helping to equip and organize Syrian rebels , like Colonel As ` aad , who want to wage an armed struggle against those units of Assad 's security forces leading the repression of protesters . Other analysts believe it would be a mistake for Turkey to go beyond support for peaceful protests by letting itself become a rear base for an armed opposition or being seen as a provocateur in Syria 's internal conflict , especially if it developed a stronger sectarian dimension . Turkey , after all , is vulnerable to mischief-making among ethnic Kurds and developments that could cause unease within its own Alevi minority community . Speculation keeps resurfacing that Turkey 's military could end up entering Syria to create a buffer zone for the protection of Syrians from Assad 's security forces . During the 1991 Gulf War , about half a million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey , returning only after Western powers , along with Turkish contingents , set up a safe haven across the border . But analysts see this option still as a last resort for Ankara , and one that is unlikely to be taken without first getting a U.N. mandate . As it has done in other Arab countries gripped by upheaval , Turkey has played on sentimental attachments to the Ottoman era , when Istanbul counted vast swathes of Arabia , North Africa and the Balkans among its dominions . Whereas Erdogan has earned admiration among Arabs for championing the Palestinian cause and leading democratic change in Turkey , analysts say Arabs would not like to see Turkish troops crossing into Syria . `` I do n't think Turkey ... would be stupid enough to intervene militarily , '' Jenkins said . `` The Arab world does n't want to see Turkish boots on the ground in an Arab country .

The funeral of Meshaal al-Tammo in the eastern Syrian city of Qamishli turned into a protest against President Bashar al-Assad , with mourners chanting anti-Assad slogans and calling on him to step down . British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least two people were killed and three wounded when the funeral came under fire . It said at least 50,000 people had turned out for the funeral . Security forces also opened fire on a funeral procession for three people who were killed on Friday in the Damascus suburb of Douma , killing one mourner and wounding 10 , the group said . At least eight people were killed in anti-Assad protests after Friday prayers . Activists said on Friday that four gunmen burst into a house in the city of Qamishli , shot dead Tammo and wounded his son . It was not clear who was behind the attack . The killing of Tammo , a respected opposition figure , angered Syrian Kurds who make up about 10 percent of Syria 's 20 million population and largely support the uprising against Assad . One activist said he feared the killing might encourage Syrian Kurds to take up arms against Assad forces , pushing the country closer to civil war . `` This is a terrorist attack , a terrorist assassination . The Kurds might feel they want to revenge . We are very angry , '' said a Kurdish activist who declined to be named . Tammo , a charismatic figure who was released from jail earlier this year , was a critic of Assad who had also angered powerful Kurdish parties because of his criticism of Kurdish rivals . The United States has condemned his killing . Video footage broadcast by al Jazeera television showed Tammo 's coffin being carried on people 's shoulders wrapped in a Kurdish flag and covered with flowers . `` Leave , Leave , '' the mourners chanted . Fares al-Tammo , Meshaal 's son , told al Jazeera from Erbil in northern Iraq that the Kurds were angry and blamed the Syrian authorities for his father 's death . `` This blood is precious to them -LRB- Kurds -RRB- , they will not give up until the regime is overthrown and the execution of Bashar al-Assad .

Assad has sent troops and tanks to crush protests against him since March but he has also promised reforms . He has ended a state of emergency and promised to hold a parliamentary election in February . He tried to pacify the Kurds by giving citizenship to tens of thousands of people , and casualties in Kurdish areas remained the lowest as anti-government protests swept the country .

MOSCOW | Sun Oct 9 , 2011 10:08 am BST MOSCOW -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Vladimir Putin visits China on Tuesday in his first foreign trip since revealing plans to reclaim Russia 's presidency , addressing a challenging relationship with a giant neighbor whose growth is both an opportunity and a potential threat for Moscow . For Putin , whose main focus has been domestic in nearly four years as prime minister , the trip sets in motion a return to forefront of Russian foreign policy ahead of a March election in which he is expected to win a six-year term as president . Beneath talk of strategic relations and shared stances on world affairs , wrangling over a gas pact worth a potential $ 1 trillion -LRB- 642 billion pound -RRB- points up the tough issues he will confront in dealing with Russia 's far more populous , faster growing neighbor . China , facing its own leadership transition next year , may try to gauge Putin 's plans for what could be 12 years at the helm of a country whose natural resources and nuclear arms make it a factor in Beijing 's economic and geopolitical strategies . `` The significance of this trip exceeds that of a normal prime minister-level visit , '' said Zhao Huasheng , director at the Centre for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Shanghai 's Fudan University . Putin will bring an army of executives including the CEOs of state-controlled energy firms Gazprom and Rosneft and aluminium producer UC RUSAL , all eager to exchange their wares for Chinese cash . His meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao will feature warm affirmations of friendship and solidarity on big global issues between two countries that often move in lockstep to counter the United States and Europe . Their double veto last week of a European-drafted , U.S.-backed U.N. Security Council resolution to condemn Syria 's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters was a warning against Western meddling in their own countries and others worldwide . Putin may use the trip to show the West an emphasis on China as Russia 's geopolitical partner and a customer for its energy . He did just that in a televised meeting with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller on October 3 , pointedly ordering him to prepare proposals on expansion into Asian markets , seen as a way to diversify Russian energy exports away from stagnant Europe . President Dmitry Medvedev has not been cool to China since Putin steered him into the Kremlin after his own 2000-2008 presidency , but his emphasis has been on presenting a friendlier face to the West and improving ties with the United States . Putin 's meeting with Miller followed European Commission raids on offices of Gazprom subsidiaries in Europe that underscored persistent tensions over the continent 's heavy reliance on Russian gas , which EU members want to reduce . But China 's friendly political ties with Russia , and their partnership in the loose BRIC grouping that also includes India and Brazil , do not make Beijing less of a tough customer when it comes to energy deals . Putin will likely seek to resolve the price disagreements that have prevented Russia nailing down a 30-year deal to supply China with up to 68 billion cubic metres of gas per year . But Gazprom 's export chief told Reuters last month that the five-year-old negotiations might not end this year , pushing back initial deliveries beyond the latest target of 2016 . Meanwhile , China is cultivating other sources of energy supplies , particularly in ex-Soviet Central Asia . A report this month by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute -LRB- SIPRI -RRB- said China was gaining the upper hand in the relationship as it becomes less reliant on Russia for advanced weapons and looks elsewhere for some of its energy . It said Russia 's significance to China would continue to diminish in the coming years , and that `` there are strategic planners in Beijing and Moscow who view the other side as the ultimate strategic threat in the long term . While Putin may use China as a foil against the West , the pragmatic former KGB officer is well aware of such concerns . As he prepares for what could be two six-year terms as president , `` the risks from China 's growth will be watched more closely than the opportunities , '' said Fyodor Lukyanov , editor of the journal Russia in Global Affairs . At an investor conference on Thursday , Putin used a joke to play down the challenge posed by China 's faster growth after TPG Capital co-founder David Bonderman outlined China 's path to becoming the world 's largest economy . `` He got me worried . He said that the United States is so far the world 's biggest economy but China will undoubtedly take over . So we now need to keep our foreign currency reserves in yuan while the Chinese will keep them in dollars , '' Putin said . `` That will be an interesting Russian doll .

The football club could still end up renting the facility under the new plan to keep the stadium in public ownership and the Olympic Park Legacy Company -LRB- OPLC -RRB- has been asked to start a new process to secure tenants . The move comes amid a protracted dispute with Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur and the plan is committed to safeguarding the legacy of the stadium 's athletics track which is central to a bid to host the 2017 world championships . `` The process to sell the stadium has become bogged down , '' Sports Minister Hugh Robertson said in a statement . `` We are acting today to end the legal paralysis that has put that legacy at risk . `` Ending the current sale process and looking for a leasehold solution will remove the current uncertainty and allows us to help secure the future use of the stadium with more confidence . '' Robertson added the government wanted to see the stadium re-open in 2014 , while West Ham were quick to express their desire to still become tenants at the venue which has cost around 500 million pounds to build . If West Ham were to win the bid again , any rental agreement is likely to save the club money compared to the original plan , which is likely to be welcome news for the outfit who were relegated from the Premier League last season . The 35 million pound cost of transforming the stadium after the Olympics is already budgeted for within the 9.3 billion pound public sector funding package for the Games . It will be downsized from its 80,000 Olympic capacity . `` I believe it will ... put us in the place where we always intended to be -- delivering a lasting sustainable legacy for the stadium backed up by a robust but flexible business plan that provides a very good return to the taxpayer , '' London mayor Boris Johnson said in a statement . West Ham were selected to inherit the stadium , the centrepiece of the July 27-August 12 Games , in February before Tottenham Hotspur sought a judicial review saying a 40 million pounds loan from Newham Council gave West Ham an unfair economic advantage and made the decision unlawful . Tottenham had been given a three-week ultimatum to accept a 17 million pounds package to stay in north London and drop the legal battle over the future of the stadium , which is in east London and nearer to West Ham 's current Upton Park home . Spurs , who have alternative plans for a new ground close to their White Hart Lane stadium , backed the OPLC decision but gave no clues as to whether they would join the race to rent . `` We firmly believe that the bid we put forward was , in fact , a realistic sporting solution for the stadium , along with a substantial return to the taxpayer , community programming and athletics provision , '' they said on their website -LRB- www.tottenhamhotspur.com -RRB- . A joint statement by the West Ham vice chairman Karren Brady and Kim Bromley-Derry , chief executive of the London Borough of Newham , also welcomed decision and was more clear-cut about future plans . `` West Ham will look to become a tenant of the stadium while Newham will aim to help deliver the legacy , '' it said . Keeping the stadium in public ownership is likely to safeguard the athletics track , which was one of the key legacy promises London gave when bidding for the 2012 Games . The track , which was laid earlier this month , is also vital to the capital 's bid to host the 2017 athletics world championships and the legal row with Spurs had threatened its existence given Tottenham are not in favor of keeping it . UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner said the government and OPLC had taken a `` bold , decisive move . '' `` I 'm absolutely delighted , '' he told Sky Sports News . `` It guarantees we are going to get this athletics stadium open , up and running , in the summer of 2014 and capable of hosting a world championships which is what we 've been after all along . '' Athletics world governing body the IAAF visited London last week to assess the 2017 bid in the wake of the Spurs row . Qatar 's capital Doha is also bidding for the championships . Another London football club , Leyton Orient , had also been part of a stadium legal challenge . The third-tier side , also based near the venue in east London , feared they could lose fans and said Tuesday 's decision vindicated their actions . `` Today is a fabulous day for Leyton Orient fans , it puts the whole thing back in the public domain , '' Orient chairman Barry Hearn said . `` Now they have to go back to the beginning and start again and we will be an interested party in that bidding process , '' he added without specifying in what capacity , admitting his club would be `` lost '' in a 60,000-seater stadium .

The family-run group , which owns the Radisson and Park Plaza brands , is spending $ 1 billion to develop new hotels in Asia . This includes in key cities Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Jakarta , Kuala Lumpur and Manila , where Carlson lacks presence . `` We are ready to use some of our own equity , partnering with local investors and developers to accelerate our development in these key cities , '' Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly told Reuters in an interview . The $ 1 billion will be spent over 5 years and will come from the company 's reserves and debt , Joly said . Funding for hotels in mid-scale markets in China , India and the Philippines as well as expanding its Radisson Blue hotel brand in both primary and secondary cities would all be aided by help from local partners , he said , without elaboration . The firm aims to open around 100 hotels over the next 4 years in Asia , more than doubling the number of hotels opened over the last 4 years , Joly said . Carlson , which owns most of its hotels through Rezidor Hotel Group -LRB- REZT . ST -RRB- , is forecasting a compounded growth rate of 20 percent in the region for its hotel business over the next 4 years . The group is planning to add 22,000 jobs in Asia Pacific in the period , with more than half of those in China . Minneapolis-based Carlson competes with U.S. brands Starwood -LRB- HOT . N -RRB- , Marriott -LRB- MAR. . N -RRB- and Hyatt Hotels Corp -LRB- H. N -RRB- in the increasingly competitive Asian hospitality sector . Carlson also owns restaurant chain T.G.I. Friday . and travel management company Carlson Wagonlit Travel -LRB- CWT -RRB- . While headwinds from Europe 's sovereign debt crisis and slowing economic growth prospects in much of the developed world could temporarily slow down travel , Joly said the firm 's targets were on track . `` Short term there are some clouds . But being a privately held company we have the luxury of being long-term focused , '' the French born Joly said . As expectations of Asian growth remain strong , major hotel chains have stepped up expansion plans in the region , trying to capture brand loyalty in some of the world 's fastest growing economies . Joly said while investors were receptive towards investing in new projects , a tightening of credit in the short term may delay the openings of some projects . `` There is tightening of the credit for sure , so that can slow down , that can delay some of the openings , '' he said , shrugging off the impact on overall investor sentiment . Short-term oversupply of hotels in China were an issue , he said , due to the abundance of new properties springing up in the world 's second-largest economy , pushing down the average daily rate below other countries . However , in the longer term , the number of hotel rooms in construction would not keep up pace with the economic growth rate of the region , giving the group ample opportunity , he said . `` Even if for one or two quarters you have some supply-demand imbalance with the growth rate , it does n't matter . Demand will catch up .

Paris-based Burhan Ghalioun , considered the group 's de facto leader , told France 24 television the newly formed SNC hoped to get recognition from European countries once its structure is in place . The European Union has welcomed the creation of the Syrian council and urged other countries to do the same , but stopped short of any call to recognize the body which is seeking international support for a six-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad . France , the first Western country to recognize Libya 's opposition , has been championing the cause of pro-democracy protesters in Syria , leading calls for a U.N. Security Council resolution to condemn the government 's bloody crackdown on them . In a symbolic display of support , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe met Ghalioun in Paris earlier this week . `` Juppe 's gesture was significant , '' Ghalioun said . `` The French will consult the other Europeans and we hope to have recognition from European countries later , but let 's wait a few days , weeks , '' he said . Ghalioun , an intellectual and political sociologist based at the Sorbonne university , was thrust into the limelight this year when peaceful protests against Assad 's government turned violent and demonstrators looked for somebody to help galvanize various strands of the opposition . The 66-year old said the West could be more `` aggressive '' in its approach to Russia , which has refused to join international condemnation of Syria 's long crackdown on protesters and used its veto along with China to reject a draft U.N. resolution . He also called for a conference bringing together the main stakeholders in the Syrian conflict . `` I think the European Union and Western countries have not done everything politically to convince Russia and other reticent countries , '' Ghalioun said . `` I do n't think there are strong enough positions and actions . '' Some figures inside Syria privately criticize the opposition in exile for being too ready to seek outside intervention . Other issues dividing the opposition include ethnic and sectarian differences , disagreement over the place of religion in the state and a generational gap between veteran opposition figures and youth activists . Michel Kilo , a member of the Syria-based National Committee for Democratic Change -LRB- NCDC -RRB- who has criticized the SNC for not including those in Syria , said on Tuesday he was ready to talk more to the council to avoid divisions that could play into the hands of Assad 's government . `` Today , there is the council and there are other opposition members and we will do everything to make sure there is just one voice , '' Ghalioun said . `` I do n't think the opposition is divided . I think the opposition is unanimous on one objective : the end of the regime and fall of Bashar al-Assad . '' Asked whether the SNC could take up arms if protests did not lead to the government 's collapse , Ghalioun dismissed the idea for now but said there was a risk of escalation . `` We are afraid of it ending up in civil war and anarchy so it 's up to show that a new Syria wo n't be one of vengeance and revenge , '' he said .

Security Council clashed with Russia and China on Friday by raising concerns about Syria and the looming specter of civil war during a closed-door meeting , council diplomats said . Speaking on condition of anonymity , several diplomats said the French , British , German and Portuguese envoys supported a statement issued on Friday by U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay , who called for international protection of civilians in Syria and warned of a possible civil war . Syrian forces shot dead at least six people protesting against President Bashar al-Assad on Friday , activists said , 10 days after Russia and China joined forces on a rare `` double veto '' to kill a European-drafted Security Council resolution that would have condemned Syria and hinted at possible future sanctions . Friday 's European push on Syria elicited an angry response from Russian deputy U.N. envoy Alexander Pankin , who complained that French Ambassador Gerard Araud was flouting normal procedure by introducing issues `` not on the agenda of the meeting , '' a diplomat present at the meeting told Reuters . The Chinese envoy told the council that since Pillay 's remarks on Syria had not been requested by the Security Council , it should not take them into consideration , envoys said . The closed-door council meeting followed the earlier adoption on Friday of two routine resolutions in public sessions . Its official agenda was a monthly review by the U.N. Department of Public Affairs on world affairs and conflicts . During the meeting , Araud told the council that `` the advocates of inaction on Syria should draw conclusions from the latest appalling developments , '' according to the French U.N. mission 's Twitter page . Araud was referring to Russia , China , Brazil , India and South Africa , the five `` BRICS '' emerging markets nations that have resisted the Western push for tough council action on Syria since the government crackdown against pro-democracy protesters began over half a year ago , diplomats said . Portuguese Ambassador Jose Filipe Moraes Cabral , one of the co-sponsors of last week 's failed resolution , confirmed he had said the council should revisit the idea of condemning Damascus . `` The situation -LRB- in Syria -RRB- is deteriorating fast , '' Cabral said . `` The council should come back to it . '' German Ambassador Peter Wittig echoed Cabral 's remarks , saying the council should not give up on Syria . `` Since the double veto was cast , the situation has continued to be extremely concerning , '' he told reporters , adding that he told the council Pillay 's report `` paints a very grim picture of the continuing repression . '' `` We said -LRB- to the Security Council -RRB- that if we let things slide , we will be at the brink of a civil war , '' he said . The British and Colombian envoys made similar remarks , though diplomats said U.S. Deputy Ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis did not touch on Syria during his remarks . Brazil , India and South Africa , which abstained from last week 's vote on the Syria resolution , did not mention the issue when they addressed the council , diplomats said .

A negative North Atlantic Oscillation -LRB- NAO -RRB- will continue to dominate the continent 's winter weather patterns , World Climate Service 's senior meteorologist Richard James said in an interview . Cold weather combined with low wind and precipitation levels in northern Europe would mean that the vast wind power generation capacity along the North and Baltic Sea coasts would generate below average electricity during the high-demand winter season . Large Scandinavian hydro-power reserves could freeze and fail to recover over the winter . Windy and wet weather in Spain and Portugal would mean ample wind and hydro power generation capacities on the Iberian Peninsula and in Italy . `` The NAO weather patterns will mean that hydro-power levels in northern Europe will be unlikely to re-charge this winter and that the North will see less wind than usual , '' James said . `` The South , by contrast , will be winder than usual , '' he added . The United States-based WCS said it expected the coming winter to be dominated by a negative phase of the NAO , resulting in colder , dryer , and less windy than average weather on the British Isles , in France , Germany , and the Nordic and Baltic countries , while Mediterranean countries should expect a mild , windy and wet winter . `` We expect another winter of unusual cold and occasionally disruptive snow from the British Isles and France across Germany and southern Scandinavia to the Baltic states , '' James said . He said that the winter was also likely to be `` front-heavy '' because the Pacific climate phenomenon La Nia had made an early appearance . `` The Pacific climate phenomenon 's El Nio and La Nia are connected to Europe , and La Nia has made an early appearance this season , leading to earlier cold weather in Europe , '' he said . `` The highest likelihood of unusual cold appears to be in early to mid-winter -LRB- late November to January -RRB- , with moderating conditions possible by February . Wet conditions will prevail in southern and southeastern Europe , but it will be generally dry in the north . '' James said the forecast had a high probability because nearly all indicators pointed in the same direction . `` Nearly all indicators point in the same direction and it is not usual to have everything lined up like that , and this also opens the possibility of even more extreme weather , '' he said . Prior to the past three years , the negative NAO weather pattern was last experienced in the 1960s , and usually occurs every 50 years but is not linked to climate change , James said , and added that the negative NAO could be a phenomenon that would dominate Europe 's winters for years to come . `` There are definitely decadal trends and there is a chance that there could be a long negative NAO phase , '' James said , and added : `` the last time we saw such a phase was in the 1950s and '60s , '' which was a period that dominated by cold winters in Europe . `` There definitely seems to be a correlation with low solar activity and a negative NAO , and it looks like the sun will be relatively inactive for a while , and that is bad news for European winters , '' he said .

Under pressure from street protests demanding the end to 41 years of Assad family rule , the president has lifted a state of emergency and promised `` multi-party '' parliamentary elections by February . But he has also deployed tanks and troops across the country to crush persistent demonstrations , casting doubt on the credibility of his reform gestures , pro-democracy activists say . `` President Assad issued today decree number 33 which stipulates forming a committee to prepare for a draft constitution , '' the state news agency SANA said . The constitution , which was changed by Assad 's late father , President Hafez al-Assad , in the 1970s , discourages any political pluralism by stipulating that the ruling Baath Party is `` leader of the state and society . '' The Syrian opposition has called for the clause to be scrapped , along with another that says the president can only be nominated by his Baath Party as well as numerous laws passed in the last 50 years which they say allow Assad and his security apparatus to practice repression and corruption with impunity . The Baath banned opposition when it took power in a 1963 coup . The party organization has lost power and status in the last decade to Assad family members , some selected cohorts and the secret police , a bloc now underpinning the power structure . New laws issued by Assad in the past three months permit `` parties committed to democratic principles '' and established an election commission . But they also preserved quotas that retain the majority of seats for farmers and workers , whose representatives are drawn from state-controlled unions . Syria 's current parliament , a rubber stamp body , does not have a single opposition figure . Human rights activists say that the official legal changes have not stopped repression on the ground that has killed 3,000 civilians or tackled extraordinary decrees that make the secret police , which rights activists say is responsible for most of the killings during the unrest , unanswerable to any law . They point to recent laws that toughened punishments for people demonstrating without a license and widened Assad 's scope to invoke nationwide military mobilization to include `` internal disturbances '' and to punish army deserters . Syrian troops and police shot dead at least eight people protesting against Assad in the last 48 hours , activists said . The United Nations called for international protection for civilians from a crackdown it said could lead to civil war between Syria 's majority Sunni Muslims and members of Assad 's minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . The shootings , near Aleppo and in Damascus and its suburbs , occurred as protesters took to the streets as they have done many times since Syria 's uprising began in March , inspired by popular revolts that have ousted three Arab leaders this year . -LRB- Reporting by Khaled Yacoub Oweis , Amman newsroom ; Editing by Mark Heinrich -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "140", "dct": "2011-10-15", "dates": ["2011-10-15", "2011-10-15", "2011-10-15", "1963-01-01", "2011-10-09", "2011-10-15", "2011-10-15", "2011-08-01", "2011-10-14", "2011-10-15", "2011-10-15", "2011-10-15"], "text": "AMMAN | Sat Oct 15 , 2011 5:35 pm EDT AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian security forces shot dead three mourners and injured 20 on Saturday when they fired on a protester funeral procession in central Damascus while troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad fought army defectors west of the capital , witnesses said . In his latest move to try and defuse discontent , part of a wave of popular unrest against repressive autocrats across the Arab world , Assad formed a committee to draft a new constitution within four months , the official news agency SANA said . The move raised the possibility that a clause designating his Baath Party , which seized power in a 1963 coup , as `` leader of the state and society '' could be scrapped . In a sign of growing regional pressure on Assad to undertake genuine reform after seven months of street protests , al Jazeera television said Arab foreign ministers would hold an emergency meeting on Sunday in Cairo to discuss the crisis in Syria . Gulf Arab states had earlier called for an immediate meeting of the Arab League to discuss the humanitarian situation in Syria and study ways to stop the bloodshed . Assad has sent troops and tanks into restive cities and towns to try put down the unrest but protests have persisted , spreading to suburbs and rural regions around cities as troops have occupied main squares in urban centres . The president blames the violence on foreign-backed `` armed terrorist groups '' who authorities say have killed 1,100 soldiers and police . The United Nations said the military crackdown on unrest has killed 3,000 people , including at least 187 children . With the deployment of thousands of police and militiamen loyal to Assad , whose family has ruled Syria for 41 years , central neighborhoods of Damascus have remained largely free of pro-democracy demonstrations . But at Saturday 's funeral for a ten-year-old boy , Ibrahim Sheiban , killed in a protest rally the day before , `` passions were running high , '' said one of the witnesses , a private sector employee who asked not to be identified for his own protection . `` The body was wrapped in white and thousands behind it were chanting ` the people want the execution of the president ' and ` we will be free despite you Bashar ' , '' he said . Some mourners began throwing stones at the security forces , who fired back with live ammunition , the witness told Reuters by phone from the scene in the Damascus district of Maidan . The killings in Maidan brought to at least nine the number of people killed while protesting against Assad in the last 48 hours , according to rights activists . A human rights organization said Assad 's forces on Saturday also shot dead a prominent activist in eastern Syria who helped organize peaceful demonstrations in the region after a military crackdown on unrest two months ago . Ziad al-Obeidi , 42 , was killed as he fled from security police who stormed his home in the provincial capital of Deir al-Zor , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . There was no comment from the Syrian authorities , who do issue statements on individual killings but deny assassinating their opponents . `` Ziad was adamant that non-violence was the only way to counter the regime 's bloodletting . He had three kids and barely enough money to put bread on the table , yet the authorities keep saying that this uprising is being lead by foreign-backed armed terrorists , '' Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told Reuters by telephone from Britain . The United Nations called on Friday for international protection for civilians from a crackdown it said could kindle civil war between Syria 's majority Sunni Muslims and members of Assad 's minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . Sunnis also comprise most of the army 's rank and file while the officer corps is comprised primarily of Alawites effectively under the command of Assad 's younger brother , Maher . The authorities have expelled most independent media from Syria , make it difficult to verify accounts of events . `` The onus is on all members of the international community to take protective action in a collective manner , before the continual ruthless repression and killings drive the country into a full-blown civil war , '' the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , said in a statement . `` As more members of the military refuse to attack civilians and change sides , the crisis is already showing worrying signs of descending into an armed struggle , '' she added . Assad was quoted by state media this week as saying Syria had `` passed the most difficult stage '' of the uprising . But opposition leaders say the mounting death toll will only turn more Syrians against the 46-year old president . In the Zabani Plain , around 35 km -LRB- 22 miles -RRB- west of Damascus on the fringes of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range , army defectors fought loyalist troops for several hours on Saturday , according to local residents . `` I saw army jeeps towing two -LRB- vehicles -RRB- belonging to State Security that were riddled with bullets . Blood was practically seeping from them , '' said a resident of the resort town , who gave his name as Mohammad . `` They ransacked houses in Zabadani overnight looking for deserters and activists . '' Sticking to a strategy of dismissing the protests as a foreign plot to divide Syria while touting `` reforms that safeguard Syria 's sovereignty , '' Assad formed a committee on Saturday to draft a new constitution within four months . `` President Assad issued today decree number 33 which stipulates forming a committee to prepare for a draft constitution , '' the official news agency SANA said .

Disappointed protesters began banging on the doors of the Arab League building as Qatar 's Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani read out the decision . `` The people demand the suspension of Syria 's membership at the Arab League ! '' Initial reaction from Syria was also negative . `` Syria has reservations on the call by the League for a comprehensive dialogue to take place at its headquarters and says it is capable of running its own affairs and security , '' Syrian state television said . Arab governments were silent for months while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's troops tried to put down the uprising with tanks and machineguns . But the country is now in danger of descending into a civil war that could destabilise its neighbors . Arab states have demanded an end to the bloodshed and called for political reform but do not agree on how to apply pressure . A permanent delegate to the League told Reuters earlier that the emergency meeting of the ministers would consider suspending Syria 's membership but that some states opposed such a move . The United Nations says 3,000 people have died in the crackdown including at least 187 children . Thousands of Syrian troops opened fire in the resort town of Zabadani on the border with Lebanon on Sunday , residents and activists said , a day after heavy fighting in the area between army defectors and loyalist forces . More than 100 civil society groups issued a collective appeal to the League 's Secretary General Nabil Elaraby to isolate Syria 's government and cooperate with United Nations investigations of alleged human rights abuses . `` I met with all parties of the opposition and they all said they were against suspending Syria 's membership as that would cut off all links between Syria and the Arab League , '' Elaraby told reporters . Assad has intensified his crackdown on protests demanding his resignation . Russia and China joined forces this month to veto a European-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Syria 's government over the crackdown , drawing condemnation from the United States and its Western allies . Syria 's ambassador to the League , Youssef Ahmed , told Arab ministers the timing of Sunday 's meeting was `` strange and suspicious . '' `` We hope it is not connected in one way or another to the failure of the United States and its European allies against Syria in the Security Council , although we believe that to be the case , '' he said . Qatar 's al-Thani denied the meeting , called by Arab Gulf states , was a response to diplomatic pressure . `` I assure you that the GCC -LRB- Gulf Cooperation Council -RRB- countries , when they asked for the meeting , did not ask for it under any agendas or dictates from outside but because they care for Syria and for the people of Syria , '' he said . Before the meeting , 121 civil society groups urged Arab leaders to protect Syrians from a government they accuse of trying to stir sectarian tension and provoke a civil war . `` The continued failure to respond to the mounting crisis in Syria will fundamentally delegitimise Arab leadership across the region , '' they said in the open letter to Elaraby . In a consultative session ahead of their main meeting at the League on Sunday , ministers agreed to call again for an end to the bloodshed but `` disagreed on the mechanism to achieve that , '' an unnamed diplomat told Egyptian state news agency MENA . `` They agreed on the refusal of any foreign intervention and the need to implement a clear road map for the required political reforms to guarantee a peaceful transition of power , '' MENA cited the source as saying . Assad , who inherited power from his late father 11 years ago , has championed Syria as the `` heart of Arabism '' and a self declared defender of the Palestinian cause while strengthening an unpopular alliance with Iran 's Shi'ite clerical rulers . A suspension from the League would have been a major diplomatic blow to Syria 's ruling elite , already struggling to cope with international isolation and Western sanctions since sending troops and tanks across the country to crush pro-democracy protests , killing and injuring thousands . Assad is also facing military defections that have increased in the last two months , as he intensified the military crackdown . Authorities have blamed the unrest on `` armed terrorist groups '' and say 1,100 troops and police have been killed . The authorities have denied in the past that army defections had occurred but Assad emphasised army unity in a letter to troops two months ago . Armoured vehicles fired machineguns and anti-aircraft guns as they entered Zabadani , in the foothills of the Anti Lebanon Mountains , 35 km -LRB- 22 miles -RRB- west of Damascus on Sunday . Local residents said army defectors fought loyalist troops for several hours the day before , and two vehicles belonging to the security police were seen riddled with bullets . Troops combed flat farmland near the town looking for defectors , ransacked homes , seized cars and arrested at least 100 people , including three female college students suspected of participating in pro-democracy protests , residents said . `` Soldiers accompanied by Military Intelligence have set up road blocks everywhere . Zabadani is now cut off from Damascus , '' said one resident who gave his name as Mohammad .

It was one of the highest daily death tolls in the large central Syrian city that has seen some of the most extensive protests in a tide of unrest where protesters are demanding an end to 41 years of repressive Assad family rule . The clashes on Monday followed the deployment of loyalist militiamen in Sunni Muslim districts , fanning tension between the city 's Sunni majority and members of Assad 's minority Alawite sect , residents told Reuters by telephone . Mindful of the threat of civil war in Syria , which straddles major fault lines of Middle East conflict , the Arab League offered on Sunday to host talks in Cairo between the opposition , who have formed a National Council , and the Damascus leadership . But Syria 's representative to the League said Syria had major reservations about the offer , while the opposition Syrian National Council said it could not engage in talks while Assad 's military continued to storm restive cities and towns . In Homs , 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north of Damascus , tanks firing heavy machineguns swept into Sunni districts of Bab Sbaa , Bab Dreib and Bab Amro where large protests demanding the removal of Assad have taken place regularly , residents and activists said . They said loyalist forces encountered rudimentary resistance , although army deserters were helping some inhabitants defend their neighborhoods and managed to hit several tanks with rocket-propelled grenades -LRB- RPGs -RRB- . `` Most residents of Bab Sbaa have fled . The troops are firing heavily from tanks and from the roadblocks in the area . The fire coming from the other direction is small and intermittent , '' a local resident said by phone . `` Roadblocks have cut off every neighborhood from another , and random firing by troops manning them is common , '' said another resident , who gave her name as Manal . Homs , the hometown of Assad 's wife Asma , lies amid fertile farmland on the main highway to Aleppo , Syria 's second city . Homs is close to the border with Lebanon , which has begun to serve as a supply line to insurgents in the city and its countryside , including army defectors who have increased in numbers since the crackdown intensified two months ago . Inspired by `` Arab Spring '' popular uprisings that have overthrown entrenched autocrats in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya , protests have spread across much of Syria calling for the Assad family 's ouster and more political freedoms . Syrian authorities blame the unrest on `` armed terrorist groups '' which they say have killed 1,100 army and police and are operating in Homs , killing civilians and prominent figures . SYRIA SAYS `` TERRORIST '' GROUP LEADER ARRESTED The official news agency said troops had arrested `` the head of one of the most leading terrorist groups '' in raids into the districts of Bab Sbaa and Mreijeh and confiscated weapons , including RPGs and gunpowder . Foreign reporters are largely banned from Syria , making independent confirmation of reported events difficult . The United Nations says Assad 's crackdown has killed 3,000 people across Syria since March including at least 187 children . The army defectors have been mostly Sunni Muslims , who comprise most of the army 's rank and file while the officer corps is composed mainly of members of the Alawite community under the command of Assad 's younger brother , Maher . The Alawites , who are an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , expanded their hold on the Syrian state , the military and secret police -- a bloc now underpinning the power structure -- after Assad 's father , the late Hafez al-Assad , took office in a 1970 coup . In Cairo , Arab League foreign ministers urged Syria 's rulers and opposition to negotiate and decided to create a committee to work for a halt to the bloodshed .

Ahmed Davutoglu 's discussion with the opposition Syrian National Council Monday night , reported by an unnamed Turkish foreign ministry official , followed a threat by Syria to deal firmly with any country which formally recognizes the council .

The formation of the council has been welcomed by Western countries including the United States and France . However , unlike the transitional council set up by Libyan rebels who overthrew Muammar Gaddafi , Western governments have not offered the SNC any formal recognition , fearing a civil war that could destabilize the region . Davutoglu 's talks with the opposition also followed fresh signs that the seven-month uprising against Assad 's rule has become more militant . One opposition group reported the assassination Tuesday of an intelligence officer in the northern province of Idlib . Davutoglu told the council `` the Syrian opposition ... should employ peaceful and legitimate means to express their just demands and in a peaceful manner work to maintain the unity of the opposition and for a democratic transformation .

But if I find something it will cover all my expenses , '' says Mohamed , who regularly camps out with friends to search for gold . Like tens of thousands of other Sudanese , Mohamed has been lured by a gold rush in the remote northeast of the vast country , where experts say large amounts of valuable minerals may lie buried . Some government officials estimate 200,000 people or more may have taken part in the rush since last year . Mohamed 's home village , Bir Ajam , is located some 30 kilometers -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- from the Hassai mine , Sudan 's biggest , in the mountainous desert hinterland of the Red Sea city of Port Sudan . The venture which runs the mine , Ariab Mining Co , in which the Sudanese government holds a majority stake and Canada 's La Mancha Resources LMA . TO owns 40 percent , is investing millions of dollars to expand gold output and look for other minerals such as copper . The gold fever is spreading some wealth to one of Sudan 's poorest regions , where nomadic life for much of the population has changed little from centuries ago . Lured by record international gold prices above $ 1,600 an ounce , villagers like Mohamed search for gold on the outskirts of the Hassai mine . Hundreds of others work in the mine itself . A mining industry conference this month in Port Sudan , the country 's first in decades , attracted dozens of foreign executives and experts -- a rare sight in a country shunned by most Western firms because of U.S. sanctions imposed over a decade ago amid charges that Sudan sponsored terrorism . `` Sudan represents one of the last remaining African countries that has significant gold potential and has not been subject of intense , systematic exploration in the modern era , '' Howard Bills of the British-based mining firm Toro Gold told the conference . The Nubian desert has been a source of gold since the time of the Egyptian pharaohs , but only in the past few years has the government stepped up exploration efforts . Sudan hopes an expansion of gold exports will bring in much-needed foreign currency and compensate for oil revenues lost with the secession of the south of the country in July this year . Before the split , the country produced about 500,000 barrels of oil a day and earned around $ 5 billion from oil exports annually ; secession meant the north lost some 75 percent of that . Annual inflation was 21 percent in September , partly because the loss of oil revenues has caused the Sudanese pound to depreciate in the black market , driving up the cost of food and other imported goods . The government has handed out almost 100 new gold exploration licences to foreign and local firms in the past 12 months , bringing the total number of outstanding licences to about 200 . `` Sudan is right now high on the list globally in terms of the likelihood of gold discoveries , '' said Tucker Barrie , a Canadian mining expert who regular visits Sudan 's industry . `` I see it as pretty positive ... There will be more discoveries . '' However , mining industry executives warn it will take years to build up gold output as only about three mining firms have started production -- the rest are still exploring . The government predicts gold output will reach as much as 70 tonnes this year and bring in $ 3 billion of revenue , potentially making Sudan the third largest gold producer in Africa , after South Africa and Ghana and before Mali . But the executives say that goal is well out of reach for now . `` I think if they make 20 to 30 percent of the $ 3 billion , that would be good , '' said a managing director of a Sudanese mining firm , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue . The official target is `` way too optimistic '' . Even the mining ministry admits that only 7 tonnes will be produced from mines such as Hassai ; the rest is projected to come from `` artisanal '' seekers like Mohamed , whose success is hard to track . A foreign mining expert working in Sudan said 4 tonnes of gold from mines would be a realistic target for 2011 . Another obstacle is the U.S. trade embargo , which deters many Western firms from getting involved , leaving the field mainly to local or Chinese companies which may lack experience . `` It 's a bit of a hit and miss business with Sudanese firms . Chinese firms are good at building mines but poor explorers , '' said a Western expert in exploration . Also , few of the small entrepreneurs are selling their gold to the central bank ; much of their output ends up with traders who smuggle it to Dubai or other major gold markets . As a result , Sudan made only $ 1.1 billion from gold exports in 2010 . This year might see a modest increase due to a higher gold price , but revenues will be way below $ 3 billion , experts say . The government is offering incentives to persuade unofficial seekers to sell their gold to the central bank , and plans to establish a refinery to enhance the value of gold products . `` You have to intervene to regulate the sector , '' said Abdelbagi Gailani , the minister of minerals . Despite the problems , Sudan 's gold output is likely to rise continuously over the next few years , experts say . Barrie estimated annual production could increase by a further 2.8 tonnes every three or four years as new mines came on stream . Meanwhile , a `` significant profit '' from the unofficial output would eventually end up in government coffers if regulation improved . Barrie said the gold rush had helped make the northeast one of the most stable regions in a country hit by insurgencies such as the rebellion in Darfur . `` We have benefited a lot from the gold mine . The company built a health center , which you rarely find here , '' said Mohammed Mahmoud , another resident of Bir Ajam . Under an expansion plan , the Hassai mine will build a pipeline from the Nile to obtain more water which engineers will use to drill deeper . As a byproduct , villages on the way will be connected to the pipeline .

But some said on Friday that Libya would have been better off if its former leader had been given a fair trial for abuses committed during his 42-year rule , which ended when rebels captured the capital Tripoli in August . `` The world now has one less dictator , '' said Ziad Khalil , a Beirut shopkeeper , a day after Gaddafi 's death . `` This is the end he deserves . '' In Cairo , Youssef Hammad , a 43-year-old business executive , said he was not surprised by Gaddafi 's gruesome demise . `` The way he was going to die , if caught , was sealed when he ignored his people 's calls for a more open and free society , '' Hammad said . `` Instead he vowed to hunt them down one by one , alleyway by alleyway , like rats . Ironically that 's how he met his maker . '' Gaddafi , a fugitive since August , was killed on Thursday after fighters for the National Transitional Council captured his last stronghold and hometown of Sirte . He tried to flee the city in a convoy , braving NATO airstrikes . His captors found him hiding in a drainage culvert , and cellphone video showed a bloodied Gaddafi being beaten . Libya 's Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said that Gaddafi was hit during `` crossfire '' while being taken to hospital , but most Libyans , including officials , seemed to have little doubt that he was probably killed by his captors . The Egyptian cabinet said after a meeting on Thursday it was looking forward to helping the Libyan people rebuild their country . But most Arab governments have yet to comment on Gaddafi 's death . Gaddafi was the third Arab head of state to be ousted this year , after Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak . But unlike Ben Ali and Mubarak , who were ousted by popular uprisings in January and February , Gaddafi was overthrown in a civil war that the new interim government says cost some 30,000 lives . Many Arabs said Gaddafi 's death was likely to scare Arab leaders still clinging to power in Syria and Yemen in the face of months of pro-democracy protests and crackdowns by security forces that have left thousands of people dead . In the Omani capital Muscat , banker Haji Ismail said Gaddafi 's death was a lesson to other Arab rulers . `` They will face such a fate if they keep oppressing their people . '' Cairo engineer Ibrahim Sabri said Arab leaders were afraid of meeting a similar fate . `` This was evident in the Syrian TV denial of Gaddafi 's news , they are afraid that they will share the same fate , '' he said . In Syria , where President Bashar al-Assad has faced seven months of popular protests opposing his rule , video footage of a demonstration on Thursday night in Homs province showed people chanting : `` Bashar , it is your turn next ! '' In the Syrian town of Houla , people carried placards saying : `` Syrian rebels congratulate the Libyan people for killing the rat Muammar Gaddafi , '' and `` Death is the fate of all oppressive rulers - first the rat Muammar Gaddafi , then the thug Bashar al-Assad . '' Some said the success of the Libyan uprising would have been more welcome had NATO forces not been involved . NATO deployed aircraft to protect Libyan civilians against Gaddafi forces in a U.N.-mandated operation . But the alliance took a visible role in the fighting that ousted Gaddafi . `` It would have been a triumph for all Arabs if Libyans themselves removed Gaddafi without NATO help , '' said Suleiman Al Sharji , an Omani political commentator . `` Now we have more questions on foreign interference as versus self-rule than ever before . '' Amr Moussa , a former Arab League Secretary General under whom the body asked for international intervention to help Libyan civilians , said he hoped that Libya will move forward quickly to achieve the goals of its people . `` I hope that Libya will transition after Gaddafi 's departure into a new phase toward the path of building a modern Libya and achieving stability and real democracy , '' the independent Egyptian daily al-Tahrir newspaper quoted Amr Moussa as saying . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Not that this development is n't great news to ordinary Libyans -LRB- at least those not part of Gaddafi 's patronage system -RRB- , but the notion that the real lesson here is to treat your populations well is patently absurd . Just ask the King of Bahrain , the latest recipient of a boatload of US military aid so he can viciously slaughter his own people . For nuanced coverage of the Libyan campaign , not just war cheerleading under the guise of promoting human rights , check out Democracy Now ! 's archive of reports . I 'd recommend American style television and media as an ideal way to spread mass ignorance . The Arab leaders could be afraid of NATO intervention and not of their people . The rebels in Libya alone could do nothing against the Mad Dog , and they could have been eliminated in a short of time , with out the NATO help . GADDAFI was about to erase the city of Benghazi and its people . Hopefully the NATO was there in the right time . We hope the NATO will do the same thing with the other tyrants and dictators every where in order to stop the phenomena of ruling the countries by tyranny . This discussion is now closed .

China controls about 95 percent of the market for the 17 elements in demand by manufacturers of everything from hybrid autos to wind power stations and has cut its export quota by about 40 percent in the past two years , sending prices soaring . Australian and U.S. firms have been quick to launch new mines and restart mothballed operations , with projects scheduled to go online as early as the end of this year . Russian deposits , while ranked third-largest globally , are largely undeveloped . Output remains limited to one Soviet-era plant in the Murmansk region . `` I would say if they start now you would see that at the end of this decade they could be producing , '' said Jack Lifton , founder of the industry consultancy Technology Metals Research . `` We are not looking for production to happen anytime soon . '' Estimates of the size of Russia 's deposits vary widely , with local geologists putting its share of the planet 's supply at almost 30 percent , while the U.S. Geological Survey -LRB- USGS -RRB- has reported that Russia and its former Soviet neighbors hold 19 million tonnes of reserves , or about 14 percent of the total . `` I think Russia certainly has potential . It has a number of rare earth occurrences . However , they have not been converted into reserves , '' said Colorado School of Mines professor of mineral economics Rod Eggert , explaining that the reserves are known to exist with a high degree of certainty and also commercially feasible to extract . German industry is eager to tap Russia 's resources . During a visit to Hanover in July , President Dmitry Medvedev said his country could become a key supplier to Europe 's largest economy . Alexander Rahr of Germany 's Council on Foreign Relations said the Federation of German Industry has since set up a research center on the issue , though no deals have been signed . Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp 's Kazakh joint-venture SARECO is also considering possible projects in Yakutia , a remote autonomous republic in the Russian Far East . No details were available from Sumitomo on the possible timeframe for projects in Russia as it has yet to commit to any specific developments . Excluding smaller quantities of rare earths produced as by-products by major miners such as Norilsk Nickel , Russia has only one active mine , Lovozersky GOK . Its loparite concentrate holds light rare earths such as lanthanum and cerium . According to the company 's website , it expects to mine 12,000 tonnes of concentrate this year , up from 11,000 tonnes last year . Lovozersky ships the concentrate to the Solikamsk Magnesium Plant in the Urals , which exported 1,466 tonnes of oxides last year to U.S. Molycorp 's plant in Silmet , Estonia and Kazakhstan 's Ulba Metallurgical Plant for processing . The Tomtor deposit in Yakutia is the highlight of Russia 's untapped reserves . `` It is a super giant , located on the territory of the Russian Federation , '' said Alexander Samonov of Russia 's Institute of Geology of Ore Deposits , Petrography , Mineralogy , and Geochemistry . He said the field holds 150 million tonnes of ores with a rare earth concentration of 12 percent and large amounts of the light rare earths cerium and samarium . In a recent report , analysts at Ernst & Young said experts consider concentrations above 10 percent to be very good . Unfortunately , the critical demand is for certain heavy rare earths used by the renewables sector in magnets , said Michael Nestour , metals and mining director at Ernst & Young . `` If you look at light rare earths , in 2013 there wo n't be any shortage in that market space , assuming the most advanced exploration projects start producing as planned , '' he said . `` And in 2016-2017 the heavy rare earth shortage ends . '' Still , prices for light rare earths such as lanthanum , used in petroleum-cracking catalysts and nickel metal hydride -LRB- NiMH -RRB- batteries , continue to soar . In a recent Reuters interview , Silmet Chief Executive David O'Brock said lanthanum spot prices were $ 130 - $ 140 per kilogram , up from $ 35 in 2010 and $ 0.85 in 1999 . Russia was one of many nations that stayed out of the market because until recently prices were low and demand from makers of products such as smart phones and wind power stations had yet to boom , said Ernst & Young 's Nestour . `` Demand was a thimble and supply was a bucket , '' he said . Analysts say that in order for Russia to increase rare earth exports , local firms would have to enter into partnerships with end-users to guarantee investment and demand . `` They need to link with companies manufacturing permanent magnets , windfarm companies , the automotive sector , '' Nestour said . `` There are also other sectors such as metallurgical alloys , defense or nuclear sectors , electric cars , low emission diodes , and there is potential in the magnetic refrigeration space . '' He also said that while no detailed cost estimates had been carried out for Tomtor , a processing facility alone would cost $ 100 million to $ 300 million . Lifton added that the cost of building the infrastructure will be considerable . `` I have heard very good things about Tomtor , the problem I have is that it gets to be 50-below there in winter , '' he said . `` Many mines in Canada get as cold as Tomtor , but they are much closer to rail and shipping links .

At a Brussels summit , the 27 EU states called on Iran to engage in `` constructive and substantial talks '' with Western powers to bring about a negotiated solution to the nuclear question `` to avoid possible future restrictive measures . '' EU leaders called in a statement for the preparation of new sanctions `` to be implemented at the appropriate moment in the case that Iran continues not to cooperate seriously nor to meet its obligations . '' They also warned Syria the European Union `` will impose further and more comprehensive measures against the regime as long as the repression of the civilian population continues . '' Washington and the European Union have already pushed four rounds of sanctions through the United Nations over Iran 's nuclear program as well as unilateral measures that have deterred Western investment in Iran 's oil sector and made it harder to move money in and out of the country . On Saturday , Iran dismissed a threat by Washington to impose sanctions on its central bank in response to an alleged assassination plot , saying the United Nations would block the plan and other central banks would not accept it . Imposing sanctions on the central bank would make it more difficult for Iran to receive payment for exports -- particularly oil , a vital source of hard currency for the world 's fifth biggest crude exporter . However , any new U.N. action would require need the assent of permanent Security Council members Russia and China , which backed previous rounds of sanctions but may be hard to persuade to go further on the basis of the allegations made so far . The European warning to Iran came after EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton responded last week to an Iranian offer to resume talks by saying there must be no repeat of the last round in January , which ended with no progress . Ashton has been leading efforts on behalf of the United States , Britain , France , Germany , as well as China and Russia , to negotiate with Tehran over its nuclear activities , which the West believes is aimed at building atomic bombs . Iran has said it is willing to resume discussions , but insists that other countries recognize its right to enrich uranium , which the West sees as an unacceptable precondition . Ashton said the six would be willing to resume talks in weeks if Iran was ready to discuss concrete confidence-building measures without pre-conditions . Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful production of energy . The European Union already tightened sanctions against Syria this month , adding the Commercial Bank of Syria to a list of entities sanctioned in protest against repression of dissent . The United Nations says 3,000 people have died in the unrest in Syria , including at least 187 children . The U.N. human rights chief has demanded that the world act to stop the carnage and warned of full-blown civil war in the country . The EU imposed an embargo on crude oil imports from Syria in September and banned EU firms from new investment in its oil industry . It also imposed sanctions on the main mobile phone firm , Syriatel , and the largest private company , Cham Holding . However , the effect of the EU sanctions has been blunted by the blocking by Russia and China of a U.N. resolution that could have led to broader imposition of such steps . The EU leaders urged `` all members of the U.N. Security Council to assume their responsibilities in relation to the situation in Syria .

With a crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Syria now seven months old , Western powers including France are relying on a combination of sanctions and diplomatic pressure to weaken Assad 's hold on power . The European Union widened sanctions against Assad and the Syrian state after China and Russia blocked an attempt by Western powers to bring about a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning violence against protesters . `` It 's true that in New York -LRB- at the United Nations -RRB- we were blocked , and that is a stain on the Security Council , which said almost nothing about this barbaric repression , '' Juppe said on France Inter radio . `` This will end with the fall of the regime , it is nearly unavoidable , but unfortunately it could take time because the situation is complex , because there is a risk of civil war between Syrian factions , because surrounding Arab countries do not want us to intervene . '' Assad , who says his government is serious about political reform , will meet an Arab League committee in Damascus on Wednesday . The six-nation committee includes Algeria , Oman , Sudan and Yemen -- countries seen as sympathetic to Syria . Juppe said that while most Arab nations opposed action against Syria , Turkey was moving closer to the Western position and had begun to exert pressure on the Syrian government to stop the crackdown . After months of clashes between protesters and security forces , which have killed 3,000 people , according to a U.N. estimate , Syrian army deserters have formed the beginnings of an armed insurgency against the state . Opposition abroad to the Syrian government has begun to coalesce under the Syrian National Transition Council . France has stopped short of recognizing the body , but signaled its support earlier this month when Juppe shook hands with its leader in Paris .

Nine soldiers were killed by armed rebels and 11 civilians were killed by army gunfire , residents and anti-Assad activists said , as little emerged from a closely watched meeting between Assad and members of an Arab League committee on Syria . The delegation leader , Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani , said the talks had been `` cordial and frank '' and that the ministers would meet Syrian officials again on October 30 in either Doha or Damascus . Down the hill from where the envoys met Assad at the `` Palace of the People , '' the authorities organized a rally to show support for the president , who inherited power from his late father 11 years ago . But with armored assaults on cities and towns failing to end seven months of protests against 41 years of Assad family rule , international pressure on the president continued to grow . The United Nations says his crackdown has killed 3,000 people , although Syria says hundreds of security personnel have been killed by armed groups trying to foment sectarian conflict . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu , who met Qatar 's Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani on Wednesday , said his country was consulting with Arab League members to push Syria to `` pull troops from cities and end its cruel treatment of its people . '' `` There are measures that have been taken and activated in this regard so that the Syrian government ends its aggression against its people , but these do not include any sanctions that could hurt the Syrian people , '' Davutoglu said after talks in Amman with King Abdullah and senior Jordanian officials . Turkish officials who spoke on condition of anonymity say the sanctions , which were announced last month without details , will affect military , banking and energy ties , among others . The United States and the European Union have already imposed sanctions on Syria 's small , but key , oil sector , which is linked to the Assad family and their friends . In the million-strong city of Homs , a hotbed of opposition to Assad , residents and activists said a general strike kept most workers at home and shops shut . One resident said armed opponents of Assad had enforced the strike . Firing by soldiers , which killed 11 people across Syria on Wednesday , also kept people indoors . In the town of Hamrat , north of Homs , suspected army deserters killed nine soldiers in an attack on a bus with a rocket-propelled grenade , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . It was the latest incident in an armed insurgency emerging alongside the campaign of street protests . `` This will end with the fall of the regime . It is nearly unavoidable , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . `` But unfortunately it could take time because the situation is complex , because there is a risk of civil war between Syrian factions , because surrounding Arab countries do not want us to intervene , '' he told French radio . In Umayyad Square in central Damascus , tens of thousands of people gathered for what has become a weekly show of support for Assad organized by authorities . State television showed them waving Syrian flags and portraits of the president , saying they were rallying under the slogan `` Long live the homeland and its leader . '' The rally took place before the envoys from six Arab nations arrived in Damascus for talks with Assad following a call on October 16 for the opposition and government to hold a dialogue within 15 days at the League headquarters in Cairo . `` What is hoped is that the violence will end , a dialogue will start and reforms will be achieved , '' Arab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby said . The delegation was led by Qatar and included Egypt , Algeria , Oman , Sudan and Yemen . Assad 's government says it is serious about political reform , and that militants are trying to wreck it . The opposition says Assad has no intention of relaxing his grip on power , pointing to an increase in killings , torture , arrests and assassinations . Human Rights Watch said the Arab mission should demand that Syria allow in independent civilian monitors . `` The only way to make sure civilians are protected is to have on-the-ground monitors whose presence would inhibit abuse by the security services , '' HRW Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said . Assad is from the minority Alawite sect in a mostly Sunni Muslim country . Sensitive to the reverberations if he were to fall , leaders of mostly Sunni nations across the Middle East have been cautious about criticizing him or taking action , as many struggle to deal with their own unrest . In Homs , residents said public employees took part in the strike for the first time , and only a few food shops were open . Video posted on the Internet showed shuttered shops on both sides of a main street in the nearby region of Houla . In Deraa the impact was reportedly even greater . `` There is total closure . The streets of Deraa are empty , even the few butcher 's shops and pharmacies that were open are now closed , '' said Jasem Masalmeh , a resident of the provincial capital . Syria has excluded most foreign media , making it difficult to verify accounts from activists and authorities .

THE HAGUE | Fri Oct 28 , 2011 7:48 pm BST THE HAGUE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - From deep in the Sahara , fearing that he will share his father 's bloody fate at the hands of vengeful Libyans and calling in old favors bought with oil from desert tribes and African strongmen , Saif al-Islam Gaddafi may be bartering a future . The International Criminal Court at The Hague confirmed on Friday that the 39-year-old heir-apparent to Libya 's slain former leader had been in touch . It urged him to turn himself in , warning it could order a mid-air interception if he and his mercenary guards tried to flee by plane for safe haven abroad . Though details remain sketchy of the whereabouts and state of mind of Saif al-Islam , the London-educated would-be reformer now indicted for crimes against humanity , the ICC offered some corroboration of reports from Tripoli 's new leaders and African neighbors that he has taken refuge with Tuareg nomads in the borderlands between Libya and Niger , seeking a way to safety . `` Through intermediaries , we have informal contact with Saif , '' ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said in a statement . `` We have learned through informal channels that there is a group of mercenaries who are offering to move Saif to an African -LRB- state -RRB- not party to ... the ICC . The Office of the Prosecutor is also exploring the possibility to intercept any plane within the air space of a state party in order to make an arrest . '' Officials with Libya 's National Transitional Council told Reuters earlier in the week that monitoring of satellite calls and other intelligence indicated Saif al-Islam was considering turning himself in to The Hague , and trying to arrange an aircraft to get him there and out of reach of NTC fighters , in whose hands Muammar Gaddafi was beaten and killed a week ago . However , surrender is only one option . The Gaddafis made friends with desert tribes in Niger , Mali and other poor former French colonies in West Africa , as well as farther afield in countries like Zimbabwe and Sudan , some of them also recipients of largesse during the 42-year rule of Colonel Gaddafi , a self-styled son of the desert and African `` king of kings '' . France , a key backer of Febuary 's revolt , reminded Africans of obligations to hand over the surviving ICC indictees - former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi and Saif al-Islam : `` We do n't care whether he goes on foot , by plane , by boat , by car or on a camel , the only thing that matters is that he belongs in the ICC , '' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero . `` We do n't have many details , but the sooner the better . '' Despite reduced circumstances since his father 's overthrow in August , the younger Gaddafi , whom some have described as a playboy in his days at the London School of Economics , may have access to portable wealth in the form of bundles of banknotes and gold bars , as well as to secret , unfrozen foreign accounts . Niger , Mali , Chad and Burkina Faso , a swathe of arid states to the south of Libya , are all signatories to the treaty that set up the ICC , established to give a permanent international tribunal for crimes against humanity after ad hoc bodies set up for Rwanda , the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone . `` If we reach agreement , logistical measures for his transfer will be taken , '' ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdallah said . `` There are different scenarios , depending on what country he is in . '' Without its own police force , the ICC depends on cooperation from member states -- which do not include world powers the United States , Russia and China . Its focus so far on Sudanese , Congolese and Kenyans has left some Africans disgruntled . Powers on the continent like South Africa and Nigeria are signatories . But Algeria , which took in Saif al-Islam 's mother , sister , brother Hannibal and half-brother Mohammed , is not . Nor are Sudan , Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe and a number of other nations where leaders might see advantage in giving him a haven . As well as enjoying protection from Tuareg allies who traditionally provided close security for the Gaddafis , Saif al-Islam may still be in the company of mercenaries from elsewhere in Africa , including possibly South Africa , NTC officials say . A South African newspaper , in an unconfirmed report , said South African mercenaries were working to fly him out . Living conditions in the desert are spartan , though the autumn climate is relatively temperate . Smugglers and others who make a living in the desert travel in 4x4s and trucks , watching fuel gauges closely , as well as by horse and camel , resting in tents as well as simple shacks scattered close to oases . Communications are provided by satellite phones powered by car engines and generators , but also networks of nomads . A bodyguard who saw Saif al-Islam as he fled last week from one of the Gaddafi clan 's last bastions near the capital told Reuters that Saif al-Islam , eldest son of Gaddafi 's second wife Safia , seemed `` nervous '' and `` confused '' . He escaped even though his motorcade was hit by a NATO air strike as it left Bani Walid on October 19 , the day before his father died at Sirte . Three of Saif al-Islam 's brothers were killed in the war . Another , Saadi , has found refuge in Niger . The arrest or surrender of Saif al-Islam would bring a new prominence for the nine-year-old ICC , whose highest profile suspect to date is Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir , who remains defiantly in office , defended by many fellow Africans . Following the killing of Muammar Gaddafi , most probably at the hands of the fighters who filmed themselves battering and abusing him , Western allies of Libya 's new leaders had urged them to impose respect for human rights , even for those accused of scorning the rights of others down the decades . NTC leaders would like to run their own trials , but acknowledge that their writ barely runs in the deep south . Their NATO allies , now winding up a mission that backed the revolt , have expressed little enthusiasm for hunting a few individuals across a vast tract of empty continent -- though French troops based in West Africa might be the best placed to step in with transport if Gaddafi did choose to surrender . Richard Dicker of the New York-based Human Rights Watch said the killing of his father made it all the more important that Saif al-Islam end up on trial in the Netherlands : `` The gruesome killing of Muammar Gaddafi last week underscores the urgency of ensuring that his son , Saif al-Islam , be promptly handed over to the International Criminal Court for fair trial in The Hague , '' Dicker said . `` This will best ensure that justice is done . '' The ICC 's Moreno-Ocampo said in his statement : `` If he surrenders to the ICC , he has the right to be heard in court , he is innocent until proven guilty . The judges will decide . `` If the judges decide that Saif is innocent , or has served his sentence , he can request the judges to send him to a different country as long as that country accepts him . '' Saif al-Islam was once seen as a liberal reformer , architect of a rapprochement with the oil-thirsty Western states on whom his father waged proxy guerrilla wars for decades . But he ran into opposition from hardliners among his brothers and had taken a lower profile before bursting back onto the world 's television screens with belligerent win-or-die rhetoric after the revolt . The ICC accuses him of hiring mercenaries to carry out a plan , worked out with his father and Senussi , to kill unarmed protesters inspired by Arab Spring uprisings elsewhere . However , even if arrested on charges relating to his role in attacks on protesters in February and March , Saif al-Islam could make defense arguments that might limit any sentence , lawyers said -- possibly a tempting alternative to death in Libya . For now , some of the few tens of thousands of people who eke out a living in the deepest Sahara , a borderless expanse roamed by smugglers and nomadic herders , say there would be a welcome for the younger Gaddafi , who in better times exhibited paintings he said were inspired by his love for the desert landscapes . `` We are ready to hide him wherever needed , '' said Mouddour Barka , a resident of Agadez in northern Niger . `` We are telling the international community to stay out of this business and our own authorities not to hand him over -- otherwise we are ready to go out onto the streets and they will have us to deal with . '' Niger 's government in the capital Niamey has vowed to meet its ICC commitments . But 750 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- north in a region where cross-border allegiances among Tuareg nomads often outweigh national ties , the picture looks different . `` I am ready to welcome him in . For me his case is quite simply a humanitarian one , '' said Mohamed Anako , president of Agadez region , itself the size of France . `` Libya and Niger are brother countries and cousins ... so we will welcome him in . '' Libya 's southern neighbors accepted Muammar Gaddafi 's largesse despite exasperation at his vision of a trans-Saharan people , which prompted concern over their territorial integrity . For northern communities in both Niger and Mali , the NATO-backed Libyan war that removed him has brought nothing but trouble , with thousands of African migrant workers and armed Tuaregs who fought for Gaddafi turning up at their door .

The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions -LRB- ICAHD -RRB- has presented the United Nations with its findings and demanded an inquiry , saying Israel targeted Palestinians by demolishing homes , revoking residency and eroding quality of life . `` We are witnessing a process of ethnic displacement , '' said Michael Sfard , a lawyer who helped draw up a 73-page report into the issue . `` Israel is manifestly and seriously violating international law ... and the motivation is demographic . '' Stephan Miller , a spokesman for Israel 's mayor of Jerusalem , Nir Barkat , dismissed the report . He said in a statement it was based on `` misleading facts , blatant lies and political spin about Jerusalem , so I 'm sure the UN will enjoy it . '' Israel seized East Jerusalem , including the Old City , in the 1967 Middle East war . It later annexed the area and surrounding West Bank villages into a Jerusalem municipality that it declared the united and eternal capital of Israel . Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and world powers have not recognized the annexation . There are some 300,000 Palestinians residents in East Jerusalem , representing about 35 percent of the city 's total population , but ICAHD said that since Israel took control of largely Arab areas it had systematically prevented their development . One third of land in East Jerusalem was taken for the construction of Jewish neighborhoods , while only nine percent of the remaining land is legally available for housing . This has all been built on , making expansion impossible . ICAHD said it was virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits to house their growing families . `` They have no other option than to leave East Jerusalem , build illegally or live in appalling , cramped conditions , '' said Emily Schaeffer , who authored the report . Those who leave lose residency rights if they are gone for seven or more years and can not return . Some 14,000 Palestinians lost their residency between 1967 and 2010 , with half of those revocations taking place after 2006 , ICAHD said . Residency entitles you to Israeli health care and national insurance benefits . Those who built houses illegally , lived in fear of having their property demolished and also faced hefty fines . Israel demolished more than 2,000 homes in East Jerusalem since 1967 , with 771 being pulled down between 2000-2011 . A further 1,500 demolition orders are pending execution . `` Palestinians will de facto be deported from East Jerusalem , not by using guns or trucks , but by not allowing them to live a decent , normal life , '' Sfard said . Because the annexation of East Jerusalem was not recognized , Palestinians living there should be considered as a people under occupation , ICAHD said . As such , Israel had no right to strip them of residency or demolish their homes . `` There is a suspicion that a war crime is taking place and that is why an investigation should take place , '' said Sfard . A statement from the Israeli mayor 's office which said that while East Jerusalem had suffered from a lack of investment in the past that had now changed . It said Barkat had `` invested an unprecedented amount of resources and efforts to improve the quality of life of Muslim residents of Jerusalem after decades of neglect by previous administrations . '' Miller , the mayor 's spokesman , added that Barkat was `` committed to improving the quality of life of Jerusalem 's Muslim residents and he will continue to do so . '' Supporters of the mayor pointed to a poll released this year by the Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion . Asked if they would prefer to be citizens of a future Palestinian state or of Israel , 35 percent of those questioned plumped for Israeli citizenship , 30 percent said they would choose Palestinian citizenship and 35 percent gave no answer . The vast majority of Palestinian East Jerusalemites rejected offers of Israeli citizenship following the 1967 war , fearing it would undermine Palestinian claims to the area , but most have Israeli residency status . -LRB- Created by Crispian Balmer ; Editing by Matthew Jones -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "95", "dct": "2011-11-02", "dates": ["2011-11-02", "2011-11-02", "2011-11-02", "2011-09-01", "2011-09-01", "2011-11-02", "2011-11-02", "2011-09-01"], "text": "GENEVA | Wed Nov 2 , 2011 5:48 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Red Cross is pressing Syrian authorities for wider access to thousands of detainees arrested in pro-democracy protests , while insisting that its own strict terms be met , its president said Wednesday . In an interview with Reuters , Jakob Kellenberger , president of the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- , said that the independent humanitarian agency would assess its role after an upcoming visit to a detention center in Aleppo . Syria opened its prisons for the first time in September , allowing ICRC officials to visit Damascus central prison which has 6,000 inmates , but that is the only facility the Red Cross has seen . Activists say 30,000 people have been arrested in the seven-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad 's rule . `` I have always made clear , also when I was -LRB- there -RRB- again in September with President Assad that yes , that this is the test phase , a first phase , but after that we want to go further , '' Kellenberger said in an interview in his Geneva office . `` I would like to see now how the next visit will go , that would be Aleppo , in order to see a little bit if we have understood each other well , '' he added . He declined to reveal specifics , but said that there were unresolved issues with Syrian authorities over the terms of ICRC visits . The agreed initial phase of visits was limited to Damascus and Aleppo , he said . `` We will certainly have a thorough examination internally after this first phase on the merits of our visits , '' Kellenberger said . `` I have to say that the first visit has shown still that we need to talk to each other in much more detail '' about the terms of the visits , he said . `` Nobody has such -LRB- high -RRB- standards as we have , '' he said . Under its standard terms worldwide , the ICRC demands full access to all detention centers , the right to interview prisoners of its choosing in private and to make follow-up visits . Syria has agreed to withdraw its military presence from cities and residential areas and to releasing prisoners as part of an Arab initiative to end violence , the Arab League said in a statement Wednesday . It was not immediately clear how many prisoners might be affected by the move or the timetable of the release . The United Nations says 3,000 people have been killed in what it calls `` ruthless repression '' of anti-government protesters that could drive the country into full-blown civil war . Syrian army deserters killed seven soldiers and eight members of the security forces and gunmen loyal to President Assad in an apparent response to the killing of 11 villagers earlier Wednesday , an activist group said . Activists say people have been rounded up and are being held in makeshift detention centers including schools . `` We have big concerns . But I meant the fact is we are the only ones who are in a position , who are accepted to do this work , '' Kellenberger said . `` The big challenge is to try to see these people . '' `` I am aware that there will be places where it would be even more urgent that we can go than the places where we go now , '' he added . Kellenberger also said that those wounded in the violence do not appear to have full access to medical treatment , as required under international humanitarian law . The ICRC has previously said it had reports of doctors , ambulance workers and other health-care workers being prevented from performing their life-saving tasks of evacuating the wounded and providing first aid and medical care . `` One of the main reasons I went in September to see President Assad was to make clear that every person is entitled to access to medical care . It was a major concern , in fact it was one of the elements triggering the visit , '' Kellenberger said . `` We have even talked about certain measures that have to be taken to make this access easier . `` But from the news I have , I do not have the impression that the problem is solved , unfortunately ... Everything indicates it remains a big problem , '' he said . -LRB- Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay ; Editing by Peter Graff -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "227", "dct": "2011-11-04", "dates": [null, null], "text": "\\* El Hatillo mine , reserve and Rio Cordoba port for sale \\* Traders seen as likely buyer By Jack Kimball and Jacqueline Cowhig BOGOTA\\/LONDON , Nov 4 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brazilian mining group Vale -LRB- VALE5 .

Vale , which bought the former El Hatillo mine and Cerro Largo reserve in April 2009 for $ 306 million , is selling these assets because they are relatively small and high-cost mines compared with the huge operations of Cerrejon , Drummond and Glencore in Colombia and they are not core assets for Vale 's business , they said .

At October 's Coaltrans conference , the biggest annual coal gathering , several of the big energy traders who recently entered the coal market said they were looking actively to buy mines because coal trading has changed in the past couple of years and it is getting much harder to turn a profit in an overcrowded space . -LRB- ID : L5E7LK3PN -RRB- Analysts at the conference predicted that 2012 would see coal M&A activity less driven by end-users seeking security of supply and more by traders and trading utilities .

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has signalled he is leaning towards joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership -LRB- TPP -RRB- negotiations despite fierce opposition from many in his own party and the politically powerful farming sector . For Noda , who became Japan 's sixth premier in five years in September , the pact is the first big test whether he can take tough decisions , preserve party unity and avoid alienating the opposition , whose cooperation he needs in a divided parliament . The TPP would in principle eliminate all tariffs within the zone , likely helping Japan 's auto and electronics exporters to better compete in the global market but hitting hard its agricultural industry , which has been protected by high tariffs on farm imports . `` This is a step that needs to be taken sooner or later if one thinks about Japan 's economic future , '' Mikitaka Masuyama , professor at National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies . `` But most noticeable effects in the short term will be negative ones such as damages to the farming sector . Few would praise him for his decision . '' Free trade is expected to top the agenda of the November 12-13 summit in Honolulu , where leaders will also discuss a green growth initiative , which would cut tariffs on environmental goods and services such as solar panels and wind turbines . In an effort to appease farmers , Noda 's government last month unveiled a plan to strengthen Japan 's agriculture by consolidating typically tiny patches of farmland into bigger farms that can withstand foreign competition . `` If we give the reform enough time , Japan 's agriculture can be stronger . A growing number of wealthy consumers in Asia will be buying Japan 's high-quality farm products , '' said Hisashi Yamada , chief economist at Japan Research Institute . The TPP was launched in 2006 as an free trade initiative among Singapore , New Zealand , Chile and Brunei . In addition to the four original members and the United States , talks have also been joined by Australia , Malaysia , Peru and Vietnam . If Tokyo joined the pact , Japan and the United States would account for more than 90 percent of the total GDP within the TPP countries . `` Some people may say this is going to be a U.S.-Japan free trade agreement in disguise . But Southeast Asian markets are the ones that will expand rapidly as we go forward , '' National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies ' Masuyama said . With its population shrinking and greying , Japan needs to look overseas for growth . But its society is split down the middle on the trade pact . A survey by Kyodo news agency earlier this month showed 38 percent backed Japan 's participation in the pact , while 36 percent opposed it . Its proponents say it is crucial to join the talks as soon as possible , so that Japan can better protect its interest , for example by seeking an exemption for rice , Japan 's staple diet . `` When it comes to rice , Japan can not easily open up its market 100 percent . Just like the United States is aiming to make sugar an exception , there is a good chance that Japan can make rice an exception , '' said Tomoaki Iwai , professor at Nihon University . Japan currently imposes 778 percent tariff on imported rice to protect typically small-scaled domestic rice farmers . -LRB- Editing by Tomasz Janowski and Jonathan Thatcher -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "301", "dct": "2011-11-08", "dates": ["2011-11-08", "2011-11-08", "2011-11-02", "2011-11-05", "2011-11-01", "2011-11-07", "2011-11-07", "2011-11-08"], "text": "Analysis : Syrian attack on rebel city mocks Arab peace plan LONDON | Tue Nov 8 , 2011 8:30 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syria 's assault on the recalcitrant city of Homs has shredded an Arab peace plan and exposed the failure of world outrage to force President Bashar al-Assad to halt a violent crackdown on an eight-month popular uprising . Tanks and snipers have battled to cow protesters and hunt army defectors in Homs , killing more than 100 , activists say , since the Arab League said on November 2 that Damascus had accepted a plan to pull the army out of cities and talk to its foes . `` The Arab peace plan died on arrival , '' said Murhaf Jouejati , a Syrian-born scholar in Washington . `` There has been no let-up in the violence . The Assad regime is in complete defiance mode . '' Arab foreign ministers will review the plan on Saturday , but Syrian opponents of Assad show no surprise at its fate . `` I do n't think anyone in his right mind was expecting Assad to pull his troops out of the streets and allow peaceful protests , '' Walid al-Bunni , a lawyer and often-jailed dissident who left Syria for Paris two weeks ago , told Reuters . `` Lack of even a threat of international intervention is viewed by the authorities as a license to kill , '' he said . Evident Arab impotence to deflect Assad from the path he has chosen for survival against what he calls Islamist militants and foreign-backed gangs throws the ball back to Western powers whose own rebukes the Syrian leader has ignored or denounced . Assad has played on fears that without him Syria could slide into civil war , Islamic militancy or Iraq-style sectarian carnage , causing what he has called a regional `` earthquake . '' Nadim Shehadi , of London 's Chatham House think-tank , said Assad had already lost power , in the sense of legitimacy , but argued that the outside world had effectively propped him up with unheeded calls for reform and dialogue . `` The people who are protesting in Syria seem to have crossed the barrier of fear , but the international community has n't . '' Many Syrians have defied a feared security apparatus to keep up demands for change , despite bloodshed which the United Nations says has cost more than 3,500 lives -- as well as those of 1,100 soldiers and police , according to the government . Armed with a U.N. Security Council mandate to protect civilians , Western powers lent air support to Libyan rebels who toppled Muammar Gaddafi , but have disavowed any intent to repeat the feat in Syria , in a far trickier area of the Middle East . Russia and China , stung by the robust Western reading of the U.N. resolution on Libya , oppose even U.N. criticism of Syria , whose uprising was inspired by others in the Arab world . The Arab League , which had suspended Libya 's membership and backed a no-fly zone there , has treated Syria more leniently . Assad 's own doom-laden warnings have reinforced the fears of Syria 's neighbors -- Israel , Lebanon , Iraq , Jordan and Turkey -- about the possibly seismic consequences of a power shift in a nation on the faultlines of several Middle Eastern conflicts . Instability in Syria , Iran 's only Arab ally , could spread to Lebanon or Iraq , which have volatile sectarian divides . Israel , long used to a calm border with Syria , frets that Assad 's fall could herald less predictable rulers . Syrian refugees have already spilled into Lebanon and Turkey , which is also wary of any revived Syrian support for rebel Kurds in its southeast . Assad still retains substantial support from his own Alawite minority , part of the business elite in Damascus and Aleppo , Christians and others who fear that Islamist radicals might come to the fore , and , crucially , army and security force commanders . `` Until now there are segments of the Syrian population on the sidelines , afraid for their lives if they go out in the streets , or betting that Assad will survive , '' said a leading dissident in Syria , who asked not to be named . He said the Arab League had embarrassed Assad with a plan he could not implement without inviting huge street protests . It could now suspend Syria and refer it to the United Nations , putting pressure on Russia and China to alter their stance . An Arab League source said a ministerial committee might return to Damascus with a reprimand and perhaps a new deadline for compliance , or dispatch Arab observers to identify violators of the deal . Sterner action , such as suspending Syria from the League or blaming it for the violence , was unlikely immediately . Waheed Abdel Maguid , at Cairo 's al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies , said the League was hamstrung by its own rifts , with Algeria , Lebanon and Yemen hostile to penalizing Syria , and Iraq , Sudan and Mauritania hesitant . `` This puts the League in an awkward situation , '' he said . `` It holds meetings but is unable to act . '' The big powers seem just as indecisive and divided , although seemingly agreed on ruling out military intervention . `` In these conditions , it is not unlikely that Turkey will take some kind of action , with implicit support from Washington and major European capitals , '' Jouejati said . But Turkey , now a bitter critic of its former friend , has yet to impose sanctions promised weeks ago , or to send clear signals on the idea of a safe haven or no-fly zone in Syria . `` We hope there will be no need for these type of measures , but of course humanitarian issues are important , '' Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the Financial Times this month . Western countries , preoccupied with global economic woes , have sharpened their rhetoric , but otherwise seem at a loss . `` Those leaders trying to hold back the future at the point of a gun should know their days are numbered , '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Monday , referring to Syria , while acknowledging the difficulty of any Libya-style `` liberation . '' The same day , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Syria 's behavior after the Arab peace plan was `` absolutely unacceptable '' and that it `` could no longer be trusted . '' But , like his British counterpart William Hague who deplored Syria 's policy , he offered no blueprint for action . The West has urged Assad 's foes to form a united , coherent front , but Chatham House 's Shehadi said this was absurd , given the diversity of opinion lurking beneath years of repression . `` This is not really an opposition , this is the whole of Syrian society , '' he said . Without decisive outside moves or the growth of a more powerful insurgency at home , Assad could survive for years , said Joshua Landis , a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma . `` Today , the opposition remains weak and the Syrian military has the upper hand . That could change if the opposition begins to construct a real insurgency , if Turkey goes to war against Syria by supporting some sort of insurgency , or if a foreign intervention is launched , such as happened in Libya , '' he said . `` None of these possibilities is on the horizon , '' Landis added , arguing that small guerrilla groups might begin to proliferate and harass the Syrian military and state . `` If they gain traction , foreign funding and arms , they could transform into a real insurgency over time .

Ulan Bator has restricted the Dalai Lama to just one lecture on Tuesday , Mongolian Transportation Minister Battulga Khaltmaa told reporters following a cabinet meeting . But the Nobel Peace Prize laureate 's planned talk on Tuesday at the Mongolian capital 's new 4,000-seat Buyant-Ukhaa sports complex , which was constructed using Chinese aid , went ahead despite government efforts to move the lecture to a less controversial location . Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing had made `` stern representations '' to the government in Ulan Bator about the Dalai Lama , who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule . `` We have always opposed any country providing a platform for the Dalai Lama to engage in activities to split China in any form , '' he told a regular press briefing on Tuesday . `` The Dalai Lama always uses the opportunity of furtive visits to publicise Tibetan independence , smear the Chinese government and play up issues related to Tibet . '' The Dalai Lama , fresh from a visit to Japan , arrived in the Mongolian capital on Monday for a three-day lecture tour at a invitation of a Buddhist group . He denies being a separatist , saying he only seeks autonomy for his homeland . Choijamtsa , the head monk at Mongolia 's Gandan-Tegchilen monastery , which is organising the visit , told Reuters that organisers remained determined to go ahead with the planned lectures . `` This is Mongolian territory and Mongolian property and we are going to do it even if others oppose it , '' he said . The Dalai Lama 's visit comes amid growing concern about China 's hardline rule in ethnically Tibetan parts of the country . At least 11 Tibetans have set themselves ablaze this year in the western Chinese province of Sichuan in protest against government controls on their religion and culture . Beijing has blamed the Dalai Lama for encouraging unrest , but the spiritual leader said the situation was caused by Chinese policies in the region , which amounted to `` cultural genocide . Mongolia , landlocked between China in the south and Russia in the north , has seen a rapid revival of Tibetan Buddhism since the collapse of the Soviet-backed Communist government in 1990 , and the Dalai Lama is recognized as one of the country 's spiritual leaders . China has been accused by human rights groups of using its growing economic clout to pressure trading partners into refusing visits by the Dalai Lama . His plans to visit South Africa earlier this year were canceled amid accusations that the government in Cape Town had refused to process his visa . Mongolia won its political independence from China in 1912 , but Beijing did not recognize its sovereignty until 1946 , and many in Mongolia are concerned about Beijing 's growing economic hegemony . Mongolia 's booming , mining-dependent economy is almost completely reliant on its southern neighbor , with 90 percent of its exports going to China in the first half of this year . During the Dalai Lama 's previous tour of Mongolia in 2002 , China retaliated by closing the border rail crossing for two days , leaving 500 passengers stranded and severing one of the country 's few links with the outside world . Mining companies based near the Chinese border said they were not aware of any disruptions to border transport so far .

Security Council . `` It happened in Libya , it may happen in Syria , '' she said during a debate on protecting civilians in armed conflict . `` More and more soldiers refuse to become complicit in international crimes and are changing sides . There is a serious risk of Syria descending into armed struggle . '' Illustrating Pillay 's point Syrian activists said that an armored government force stormed an area northwest of the city of Hama on Wednesday in pursuit of army defectors challenging President Bashar al-Assad 's rule . Pillay reiterated U.N. estimates that `` well over 3,500 '' people have been killed in Syria since anti-government demonstrations began in March . `` Tens of thousands of people , including doctors , nurses and wounded patients , have been arbitrarily arrested and many remain detained incommunicado , placing them at serious risk of torture , '' she said . Syria agreed to an Arab League plan on November 2 , pledging to pull its military from restive cities , set political prisoners free and start talks with the opposition , which wants to remove Assad and introduce more democratic freedoms . Pillay told the 15-nation Security Council she was `` concerned that the killing of civilians has not stopped . '' She urged Damascus to allow a human rights monitoring mission to help ensure that Syria complies with the Arab League agreement . Last month Russia and China joined forces to veto a European-drafted Security Council resolution that would have condemned the Syrian government 's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators and threatened possible sanctions .

Hours after the League 's decision , hundreds of Assad supporters armed with sticks and knives attacked the Saudi Arabian embassy in Damascus and Turkish and French consulates in the city of Latakia , residents said . U.S. President Barack Obama praised the League 's move and France said it was time for international bodies to take more action against Syria 's government . The Arab League will impose economic and political sanctions on Damascus and has appealed to member states to withdraw their ambassadors , said Qatar 's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani . It will also call a meeting of Syrian opposition parties , he said . `` We were criticised for taking a long time but this was out of our concern for Syria , '' Sheikh Hamad told reporters at the League 's headquarters in Cairo . `` We needed to have a majority to approve those decisions . '' Syria 's representative at the Arab League said the decision was `` not worth the ink it was written with . '' The League 's announcement was a sharp rebuke for Syria 's leadership which sees itself as a champion of Arab nationalism . Hopes among Western powers that Assad would be isolated by his Arab neighbors were repeatedly dashed until now . Some Arab leaders have been reluctant to turn against one of their peers given their own restive populations , Middle East diplomats say . But Assad has pressed ahead with the crackdown on protesters against his rule despite an Arab peace plan brokered on November 2 . The United Nations says more than 3,500 people have been killed in seven months of violence . Syria blames armed groups for the violence and says 1,200 members of the security forces have been killed . Assad , from the minority Alawite community which has held power for four decades in mainly Muslim Syria , has said he has used legitimate means to confront a foreign conspiracy to sow sectarian strife . Activists said six people were killed in Syria on Saturday . Sheikh Hamad said the suspension of Syria from the regional body would take effect on November 16 , but did not detail the sanctions . `` We ask the Arab Syrian Army to not be involved in the violent actions and killing of civilians , '' Sheikh Hamad said , quoting from an Arab League statement . Syria 's Arab League representative , Youssef Ahmed , said suspending Damascus violated the League 's charter because it could only be done by consensus at a summit of Arab leaders . It was clear that `` orders were issued to them from the United States and Europe to hasten a decision against Syria , '' Ahmed told Syrian state TV . As news of the suspension spread in Syria , hundreds of men shouting pro-Assad slogans broke into the Saudi embassy in the Syrian capital , residents told Reuters . Angry crowds also attacked the French and Turkish consulates in Latakia , 330 km -LRB- 210 miles -RRB- north of Damascus on the Mediterranean coast , locals said . The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement demonstrators `` gathered outside the embassy , threw stones at it , then stormed the building . '' It said Syrian security forces did not react fast enough and held the Syrian government responsible for protecting Saudi interests . A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said he was unaware of any attacks on French interests in Syria . There was no immediate confirmation from Ankara . A senior diplomat in Damascus confirmed the attacks . `` We do not have the full picture from Latakia , but the attacks there appear to have been really bad . '' Syrian TV reported a demonstration outside the Qatar embassy in Damascus . Assad 's opponents hailed the League 's new resolve . `` This gives a lot of strength to the position of the Syrian National Council . This is now an Arab position , '' said Basma Qadmani , a member of the executive committee of the Syrian National Council , the most prominent opposition group . Qadmani said that now that the Arab League had taken its decision `` we believe there is no justification for international reluctance '' to take tougher steps against Assad 's government . Obama praised the Arab League and said he would continue to pile pressure on the Syrian leadership . `` These significant steps expose the increasing diplomatic isolation of a regime that has systematically violated human rights and repressed peaceful protests , '' he said in a statement . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeated her call for Assad to step down . `` International pressure will continue to build until the brutal Assad regime heeds the calls of its own people and the world community , '' she said in a statement . German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the decision sent an important signal to those in the U.N. Security Council who had up to now prevented a clear resolution on Syria . `` We will urge this to be seen as a chance for a change of heart , '' he said . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said it was time for international bodies to take more action . `` France appeals to the international community to hear the message sent by the Arab states , to take its responsibilities and to thus act without further delay , '' he said in a statement . Freezing Syria out of the 22-member League of Arab States carries extra symbolism in the wake of events in Libya , where Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed in a rebellion that benefited from NATO air support . The NATO mission got U.N. Security Council approval after Libya was suspended by the Arab League . `` This step introduces a possibility of foreign intervention and opens the door for engaging the international community in the case , '' said Nabil Abdel Fattah , a political analyst at the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo . Sheikh Hamad held out the possibility that the League may ask the United Nations to help protect the rights of Syrians . `` If the violence and killing does n't stop , the Secretary General will call on international organizations dealing with human rights , including the United Nations , '' he said .

So I checked and the headline should have used `` laid '' instead . `` Laid '' is the past tense of `` lay '' and `` lain '' is the past tense of `` lie . '' Lie , Lay ... they are confusing . He is a butcher who appears to be nothing more than another self-destructive dictator . Syria 's representative to the Arab League said suspending Damascus violated the organization 's charter and showed it was `` serving a Western and American agenda .

For the leader of a country which , under 40 years of Assad family rule , has portrayed itself as the principal defender of Arab rights , the Arab League 's move on Saturday was a wounding blow . His military crackdown on the uprising , in which the United Nations estimates 3,500 people have been killed , had already alienated former ally Turkey and led Western nations to impose sanctions and call for him to step down . But the surprise decision by the Arab League to suspend Syria and announce political and economic sanctions marked a dramatic new low in Assad 's international standing , leaving him ever more dependent on a close alliance with non-Arab Iran . Assad 's determination to crush an uprising which he blames on Islamist militants backed by foreign powers , coupled with the resilience of street protests and the emergence of an armed insurgency , has made Syria 's uprising one of the most intractable conflicts of this year 's Arab revolts . His use of tanks to seize back control of the city of Hama in August revived memories of his father 's crushing of an uprising nearly 30 years ago , and led U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to accuse him of `` losing all sense of humanity . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe warned Assad last month that the `` barbaric repression '' in Syria would `` end with the fall of the regime , '' and even ally Russia said he risked a `` sad fate '' unless he ended the violence and implemented reforms . `` If he just defiantly continues to defy signals from the Arab world and international community it 's increasingly grim for him , '' said Rami Khouri , a Beirut-based Middle East analyst . Just weeks before the uprising erupted in March , the 46-year-old leader said Syria was immune from the rebellions which have overthrown the leaders of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya because its foreign policy was closely aligned with popular Arab sentiment . In a speech at Damascus University in June , one of just a handful of addresses he has made since the unrest began , Assad justified the crackdown and said he was overwhelmed with support from Syrians he had met to discuss the crisis . `` The love I felt from those people who represent most of the Syrian people is something I have never felt at any stage of my life , '' he said . In fact the unrest has polarized Syria . Many demonstrators now openly chant for Assad 's execution -- a scene unimaginable eight months ago -- but he is still able to rally huge crowds for state-organized demonstrations and retains a core of support particularly among minority Christians and his own Alawite sect . Alongside the military campaign against protests , Assad has lifted a state of emergency in place for nearly 50 years , approved laws to allow parties other than his ruling Baath Party to be established , and promised dialogue with the opposition . The characteristically ambiguous stance , mixing iron-fisted security while holding out the promise of change , helped to mute international criticism in the early stages of the uprising . But critics said his decision to send troops into several cities in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan four months ago showed he had chosen the `` security option '' to crush the protests rather than address their grievances . Tall and softly spoken Assad was thrust into the spotlight after the death of his elder brother Basel in a car crash in 1994 . Called back from medical studies in London , he gradually assumed a higher profile and six years later inherited the presidency when his father died after ruling Syria for 30 years . To allow the 34-year-old to assume power , Syria 's parliament met hastily to amend a constitutional clause requiring the president to be at least 40 years old . In office , he held out the prospect of reforming one of the Arab world 's most tightly controlled states and oversaw a short-lived move toward political freedoms before his `` Damascus Spring '' faded amid a wave of repression and arrests . Assad also strengthened his father 's strategic alliance with Iran and supported militant Islamist groups including the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah . He ended nearly three decades of Syrian military presence in neighboring Lebanon under international pressure following the 2005 assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri . But the collapse in January of Beirut 's pro-Western government , led by Hariri 's son , was the latest sign that Assad had clawed back influence in Lebanon , one of only two countries to oppose Saturday 's Arab League move . Although he backs anti-Israel militants , he also pursued indirect peace talks with Israel and , despite continued Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , ensured the front line usually remained quiet . At home he started liberalizing the economy , easing decades of central control and allowing limited foreign investment . But while those around him , including his cousin Rami Makhlouf , acquired great wealth , ordinary Syrians saw few benefits . He also maintained the grip on power held by his family and Alawite sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim state . His brother Maher commands the Republican Guard and is the second most powerful man in the country while brother-in-law Assef Shawkat is deputy chief-of-staff of the armed forces . Assad 's wife Asma , who grew up in London and worked at an investment bank , helped him try to project a softer , liberal and modern image to the outside world , countering Syria 's reputation as a repressive police state . He insists that he remains in touch with his people even after a decade in power and eight months of trying to crush a determined uprising . `` I live a normal life . I drive my own car , we have neighbors , I take my kids to school , '' he told the British Sunday Telegraph newspaper last month . `` That 's why I am popular .

Divided over their relationship to Syria , politicians previously trod carefully in statements for or against the Syrian government whose army has been struggling to crush eight months of protests against President Bashar al-Assad . But Saturday 's vote at the Arab League , in which Lebanon was one of only two countries to oppose Syria 's suspension , exposed the depths of divisions in a country where many are linked to Syria by religious , political and family ties , but others have bitter memories of three decades of Syrian military presence in Lebanon . The Lebanese talk show `` With Objectivity '' was abruptly taken off air on Monday evening when local politicians Mustafa Alloush and Fayez Shukr , seated on-set in business suits , started throwing glasses at one another and raising their chairs -- sending insults and papers flying . Shukr , from Lebanon 's pro-Syrian Baath Party , fumed as Alloush said Assad was `` a liar . '' Shukr and Alloush , from Lebanon 's anti-Syria opposition parties , then traded expletives . Prime Minister Najib Mikati 's government , which is backed by Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian parties , angered the opposition and surprised even some cabinet members by choosing to vote against Syria 's suspension , rather than abstaining as it has done at United Nations votes on Syria . `` We are seeing an escalation of political tensions . It is a sign Lebanon is split , '' said Minister of Public Works Ghazi Aridi . `` We should have taken a neutral stance ... What we saw on television last night is a direct result of these rising tensions . It 's not only unfortunate and embarrassing , it 's worrying , '' he told Reuters . Lebanon has maintained relative calm despite the bloodshed across its borders . Many Lebanese , haunted by the specter of their 1975-1990 civil war that divided the country along sectarian lines , have been tight-lipped about Syria 's conflict , which many also worry could spiral into sectarian war . Some politicians have posted increasingly heated comments on Twitter , which has grown in appeal as a platform for Lebanese political leaders from President Michel Suleiman to former prime minister and opposition leader Saad al-Hariri . On Sunday , after Lebanon 's vote against Syria 's suspension in the Arab League , Hariri posted a string of critiques on the social network . `` They will be judged by the Lebanese and the Arabs and by history for their immoral and subservient abandonment of all national and human dignity , '' he wrote , adding that the vote put Lebanon on `` The side of murder , dictatorship and anti-Arab identity . '' Mikati , who has also become a regular Twitter user , even hosting Twitter debates , defended the vote against Syria 's suspension . `` Leadership is not just about followership or giving people what they want to hear , '' he told Twitter followers , arguing the decision to vote was done in the national interest . The prime minister also said he was informed of the on-air political scuffle on Monday : `` Unfortunately , it happens on TV in many democracies ... but , not my style .

Prince Turki al-Faisal , the former chief of Saudi intelligence services , said Assad had made his position clear by failing to live up to commitments made under an Arab League initiative to stop the bloodshed and start political dialogue . `` Inevitably , I think , the lack of response of Mr. Assad to all the efforts made to end the fighting in Syria means that he 's taken the view of not accepting these matters , '' he told a Washington , D.C. , audience . `` In that context , there will be growing popular opposition to him , and killing every day .

'' The nephew of Saudi Arabia 's king is a former ambassador to Washington and London and remains an influential public voice of Saudi Arabia 's royal family although he has held no official government role since retiring in 2006 . The prince said the Arab League had given Assad a `` last chance '' to comply with its proposal to resolve the situation and would now be expected to take further steps -- citing Libya as a precedent . He said that Saudi Arabia and its partners in the Gulf first brought Libya to the Arab League in March `` and pushed the Arab League to take a decision to move the issue to the United Nations Security Council and bring about the resolution that allowed for intervention in Libya .

Further intensifying the international pressure on Assad to end his repression of protests , France withdrew its ambassador from Syria and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Paris was working with the Arab League on a draft U.N. resolution . Last month Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Damascus , but the Arab League 's decision last weekend to suspend Syria has given international moves new momentum . On the day the suspension came into force , the League 's foreign ministers met in the Moroccan capital with a Syrian flag next to an empty chair where the Syrian minister , who boycotted the meeting , would have sat . The League -- which normally shies away from decisive action against its own members -- decided at the meeting to ask its experts to draft recommendations on economic sanctions on Syria . The decision brought a plan announced at the weekend one step closer to implementation . At their meeting in Rabat , the Arab foreign ministers also gave Damascus three days to implement a road map agreed this month to end the bloodshed and allow in observers , though they did not say what would happen if Syria failed to comply . Asked if the ultimatum was a last attempt at diplomacy , Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim al-Thani told reporters : `` We do not want to talk about a last-ditch attempt because I do not want this to sound like a warning . `` What I can say is that we are close to the end of the road as far as the -LRB- League 's -RRB- efforts on this front are concerned . '' The Arab League has stopped short of calling for Assad 's departure or proposing any Libya-style military intervention , but its ostracism of Syria is a blow to a country whose ruling Baath party puts Arab nationalism at the center of its credo . In Damascus , Assad supporters threw stones at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates , in one of the most secure districts of the city , and smeared its walls with graffiti , witnesses said . Speaking earlier in Rabat , Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu compared Syria with Libya , where rebels captured , humiliated and killed Muammar Gaddafi last month . `` The regime should meet the demands of its people , '' he said . `` The collective massacres in Syria and ... the bloodshed can not continue like this . '' Turkey has spent years courting its neighbor , but is now leading regional efforts to pit pressure on Assad . In Tehran , Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi criticized the Arab League for `` acting in a way that will hurt the security of the region . '' He told the official news agency IRNA that Syria , an ally of Iran since 1980 , had repeatedly pledged to meet legitimate popular demands and enact reforms . `` Unfortunately , some countries believe that they are outside the crisis ... but they are mistaken because if a crisis happens they will be entangled by its consequences . '' Western countries have tightened sanctions on Syria and on Monday Jordan 's King Abdullah became the first Arab head of state to urge Assad to quit . In the early months of the uprising , attempts by security forces to crush mainly peaceful protests accounted for most of the violence . But since August there have been growing reports of army defectors and armed civilians fighting back . Activists said Free Syrian Army fighters fired machineguns and rockets at a large Air Force Intelligence complex on the northern edge of the capital at about 2:30 a.m. -LRB- 0030 GMT -RRB- . A gunfight ensued and helicopters circled over the complex , on the Damascus-Aleppo highway . There were no immediate reports of casualties . Syrian state media did not mention the attack . Washington said it had few details and no confirmation of the incident , but that Assad was courting trouble . `` It 's not surprising that we are now seeing this kind of violence , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . `` We do n't condone it in any way , shape or form . But let 's be very clear that it is the brutal tactics of Assad and his regime in dealing with what began as a non-violent movement -LRB- that -RRB- is now taking Syria down a very dangerous path . '' A Western diplomat in Damascus described the assault as `` hugely symbolic and tactically new , '' saying that if the reported details were true it would be `` much , much more coordinated than anything we have seen before . '' `` To actually attack a base like this is something else , and so close to Damascus as well , '' said the diplomat , adding that fighting in recent weeks involving army deserters in the town of Rastan and the city of Homs resembled a localized civil war . `` It 's not a nationwide civil war , but in very specific locations , it is looking like that , '' said the diplomat . The Free Syrian Army was set up by deserters and is led by Colonel Riad al-Asaad , who is based in southern Turkey . It announced this week that it had formed a `` temporary military council '' of nine rebel officers , led by Asaad . The statement said the Free Syrian Army aimed to `` bring down the regime and protect citizens from the repression ... and prevent chaos as soon as the regime falls , '' adding that it would form a military court to try `` members of the regime who are proven to have been involved in killing operations . '' Syrian television showed thousands of Assad 's supporters rallying in Damascus and Latakia to mark the day his father Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970 . It said the crowds were also voicing their rejection of the Arab League 's decision . `` God , Syria , Bashar , nothing else ! '' shouted demonstrators in central Damascus , who turned out in heavy rain to wave flags and posters of the president . Two large posters of Assad and his father hung from a building . `` Neither rain nor sanctions will stop us expressing our nationalism , '' the television said . Syrian authorities have banned most independent media . They blame the unrest on `` armed terrorist gangs '' and foreign-backed militants who they say have killed 1,100 soldiers and police . Hundreds of people have been killed this month , one of the bloodiest periods of the revolt . Syria says it remains committed to the Arab peace plan , which calls for the withdrawal of troops from urban areas , the release of prisoners and a dialogue with the opposition .

The Arab League has suspended Syria and given it until the end of the week to comply with an Arab peace plan to end bloodshed that has cost more than 3,500 lives , by a U.N. count . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , whose country is one of Syria 's few remaining foreign friends , said demands for Assad 's removal would destroy the initiative , which calls for dialogue between the Syrian government and its foes . `` If some opposition representatives , with support from some foreign countries , declare that dialogue can begin only after President Assad goes , then the Arab League initiative becomes worthless and meaningless , '' Lavrov said . He was speaking after talks with European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton , who said the world must bring all the influence it could to bear on Syria to change course . Lavrov said a raid on Wednesday by the Free Syrian Army on an Airforce Intelligence complex on the outskirts of Damascus was `` already completely similar to real civil war '' . Opposition sources said Syrian army defectors had killed or wounded 20 security police in the early-morning attack , the first of its kind in an eight-month revolt against Assad . It was not possible to verify the casualty toll . The authorities have not mentioned the attack . Syria has barred most foreign media since unrest began in March . `` The attack itself was significant because of the target and the ability to pull it off . It 's much too soon to tell if this is the beginning of a trend of armed opposition to the regime , '' a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity . State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States did not have any contact with the Syrian Free Army but did not condone any use of violence . He rejected the suggestion that Syria was virtually in civil war , saying : `` We believe it 's very much the Assad regime carrying out a campaign of violence , intimidation , and repression against innocent protesters . '' Residents of Harasta , the suburb where the Airforce Intelligence compound is located , said army deserters had fired rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns for 10 minutes , provoking a security sweep that netted about 70 people . Together with Military Intelligence , Airforce Intelligence is in charge of preventing dissent within the armed forces . Syria blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups who it says have killed more than 1,100 soldiers and police . Hundreds of people have been killed this month , one of the bloodiest periods in the revolt that began in March . Catherine Altalli , of the opposition Syrian National Council , said Wednesday 's assault was understandable after the violence , detention and torture used on peaceful protesters . `` I am not saying this is right . There have to be limits , '' she said . `` But what is unacceptable is that every day bodies come out with marks of torture from Air Force Intelligence buildings and other secret police dungeons across Syria '' . Syria 's pervasive security apparatus , dominated by Assad 's minority Alawite sect , underpins the power structure that has enabled Assad and his father before him to rule for 41 years . The bloodshed in Syria has angered other Arab and Western nations , whose criticism of Assad led to several attacks on diplomatic missions in Damascus and other cities this week . Syrian state media said the authorities had vowed to prosecute anyone who carried out such attacks . France , which withdrew its ambassador from Damascus on Wednesday , said it was encouraging Syrian opposition groups , which include the Paris-based Syrian National Council , but remained opposed to outside military intervention . `` We have had contacts with them ... in any case we are helping them , we are encouraging them to get organised , '' Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French BFM radio . France was the first Western nation to recognize Libyan rebels in March , but has yet to endorse any Syrian group . While the West appears to have no appetite for military intervention in Syria , a leader of Syria 's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood said Turkish military action might be acceptable . `` If other interventions are required , such as air protection , because of the regime 's intransigence , then the people will accept Turkish intervention . They do not want Western intervention , '' Mohammad Riad Shaqfa , who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia , told a news conference in Istanbul . Ankara is considering imposing sanctions on Syria , has hosted opponents of Assad and is working with the Arab League to increase pressure on Damascus , but denies any plan to intervene militarily in its southern neighbor . No U.N. sanctions against Syria seem likely given opposition from Russia and China , which last month vetoed a draft Security Council resolution condemning Damascus . Now France , Britain and Germany plan to ask the U.N. General Assembly 's human rights committee to approve a resolution condemning the violence in Syria , before putting the non-binding measure to a vote in an Assembly plenary session . Burhan Ghalioun , head of the Syrian National Council , called for a calming of sectarian tensions between Alawites and majority Sunni Muslims , especially in the restive city of Homs . `` We have seen in the last few weeks kidnappings , assassination and score-settling among members of the same people , even from within the sons of the revolution , which poses a dangerous threat to the gains of the revolution and offers a big service to the regime , '' he said in a statement .

Under the rule , a bank holding sovereign bonds denominated in the currency it operates in can treat them as having a zero risk weighting when calculating the size of its capital buffer . Financial experts say such zero risk weighting is untenable now that the bonds of countries like Greece , Portugal and Ireland , all rescued by EU funds , have been sharply downgraded . `` We will be working on that in the next months , '' the EU 's financial services chief , Michel Barnier said during a visit to the German capital on Thursday . The rule is long enshrined in global bank standards authored by the Basel Committee and remains in their new version , Basel III , which comes into force from 2013 . Insurers have a similar rule and are also major holders of sovereign debt . Past attempts to revisit the rule were rebuffed amid fears that a two-tier sovereign debt market would emerge in regions like the euro zone . The issue will become even more acute under Basel III as banks will have to build liquidity buffers that must include a large chunk of highly rated government debt , which would be hard for Greek banks at the moment . Euro zone debt worries are also spreading . Spain and France struggled on Thursday with government bond auctions , with Madrid forced to pay the highest borrowing costs since 1997 as investors prefer what they perceive to be less risky German Bunds . Barnier said the zero-risk weighting issue should first be tackled at the level of the Group of 20 -LRB- G20 -RRB- top economies , who endorsed Basel III a year ago . `` We 'd like to have a common approach , '' Barnier said . There should be a coherent approach to banks and insurers but there is no precise timeline at this stage , he added . Barnier 's is the latest influential voice in the debate after Germany 's deputy finance minister Joerg Asmussen , who joins the European Central Bank 's Executive Board at the end of this year , said on Monday the rule should be reviewed once the euro zone crisis has passed . Gabriel Bernardino , chairman of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority said on Wednesday he wanted a review of the rule in the wake of the euro zone debt crisis as a two-tier debt market has already emerged . `` The change in perception in relation to the risk of sovereign exposures is out there , '' Bernardino said . European Banking Authority Chairman Andrea Enria has said supervisors will have to consider risks from sovereign debt holdings when checking if banks hold enough capital . Barnier has already proposed a draft law to turn Basel III into EU law . Sharon Bowles , the UK Liberal Democrat chairman of parliament 's lead economic affairs committee is also drawing up amendments to end zero risk weighting . `` I will do something in the capital requirements directive . There is a lot of parliamentary support , '' Bowles said on Thursday . She is considering deleting the reference to zero risk in the draft EU law , giving powers to the European Systemic Risk Board to recommend that banks with risky government debt increase their buffers , or cap bank exposures to debt . -LRB- Reporting By Gernot Heller in Berlin and Huw Jones in London -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "298", "dct": "2011-11-17", "dates": ["2011-11-16", "2011-10-01", "2011-10-01", "1980-01-01", "2011-11-14", "2011-08-01", "2011-11-14", "2011-11-14", "1970-01-01", "2011-11-01", "2011-11-15"], "text": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South .

As the country apparently slides further toward civil war , analysts say Assad will seek to deny nascent armed opposition groups sufficient territory to organize a guerrilla campaign . His task will be the easier if the former soldiers are unable to obtain sustained expert help from abroad in organizing their logistics and training recruits . It is not yet clear if the defectors have forged such a network , either from the Syrian diaspora or foreign powers . `` If they get help from Turkey or certain Arab countries it could take maybe 5 , 6 or 8 months to win against the regime , '' British-based opposition activist Samer Afndi told Reuters . `` If no help will come , it will take a longer time , '' said Afndi , a former Syrian state security official . He said morale among many in the opposition was boosted by a raid by army defectors on an airforce intelligence complex in Harasta near Damascus on Wednesday that had killed or wounded 20 policemen . It was the first of its kind in an eight-month revolt against Assad 's rule by protesters inspired by uprisings which toppled the leaders of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . But Afndi said the guerrillas , estimated by some analysts at several thousand , needed safe liberated areas in which to train and obtain logistical support . `` In truth , the armed insurgency is not strong enough to significantly threaten the regime at present , '' Alan Fraser , Middle East analyst for risk consultancy AKE , told Reuters . `` However , with support from elsewhere , it may become more organized and capable of inflicting damage . '' `` The turning point will come when it has the ability to control ground in the face of an regime counter-offensive . '' The exact strength of the dissident soldiers is not known and Syria 's ban on most foreign media makes it hard to verify events on the ground . Colonel Riad al-As ` aad of the Free Syrian Army told Reuters in Turkey last month that 10-15 ,000 soldiers , out of the roughly 200,000-strong military , had defected all over the country and that desertions were continuing every day . Syria 's military is controlled by the president 's brother Maher and members of their minority Alawite sect , while the army is comprised mostly of Sunni Muslims , who also form the majority of Syria 's population . Diplomatically Assad looks increasingly isolated , a factor that may eventually affect the military equation on the ground . The Arab League agreed on Saturday to start talks with Syrian dissidents after a majority of its 22 members voted to suspend Syria 's membership of the pan-Arab body from Wednesday over its violent response to protests . REGIONAL POWERS MAY GET SUCKED IN The rebellion has been met by a military crackdown that has killed more than 3,500 people , according to a U.N. count . Syria blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups who it says have killed more than 1,100 soldiers and police . In a note to clients , London 's Exclusive Analysis consultancy said the attack in Harasta had likely dealt a psychological blow to the political elite around Assad . `` Further attacks of this kind would likely encourage further defections in the Syrian Army , sensing that it might be on a losing side . `` Along with implied Turkish support for armed opposition , this suggests that the Assad government will struggle to contain protests in major cities in the 3-6 month outlook and increases the risk of a civil war beyond that timeframe . A Syria expert at Exclusive Analysis who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic said he expected `` a steady erosion of the power of the Syrian army and a steady limiting of the territory that it can access . '' `` The way it 's heading is more toward full scale civil war which draws in the intervention of regional actors . '' But Shashank Joshi , an associate fellow at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute , told Reuters `` the army has a lot left in it . It still has enough elite units and has enough size and capability to still mount severe violence . '' `` The question is , the bits that it ca n't hold , are they ever going to be retaken by the government ? And my suspicion is , they are not , '' he said , referring to areas around the southern city of Deraa and the central city of Homs . Joshi expects `` a stalemate '' between the two sides where the government can not retake land it has lost but the insurgents can not challenge the army in areas they would like to take . -LRB- Reporting by William Maclean ; Editing by Jon Hemming -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "200", "dct": "2011-11-18", "dates": ["2011-11-18", "2011-11-18", "2011-11-18", "2011-10-01", "2011-11-12", "2011-11-18", "2011-11-18"], "text": "WASHINGTON | Fri Nov 18 , 2011 5:34 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Friday Syria could slide into civil war but she did not foresee the global community intervening in the same way it did in Libya . `` I think there could be a civil war with a very determined and well-armed and eventually well-financed opposition that is , if not directed by , certainly influenced by defectors from the army , '' Clinton told NBC news in an interview in Indonesia , where she was attending a regional summit . `` We 're already seeing that , something that we hate to see because we are in favor of a peaceful protest and a nonviolent opposition , '' she said . Clinton said , however , that she saw no prospect for the kind of coordinated international intervention that occurred in Libya , where a NATO-led coalition won a U.N. mandate to mount air strikes in support of rebels fighting Muammar Gaddafi . `` There is no appetite for that kind of action vis-a-vis Syria , '' Clinton said , pointing to regional moves by the Arab League and Turkey as key to persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to halt the violence against civilians . The United States and the European Union have both imposed a series of targeted sanctions against Damascus . But U.N. sanctions are seen as unlikely given opposition from Russia and China , which last month vetoed a draft Security Council resolution condemning Syria . The Arab League has suspended Syria and set a Saturday deadline for it to comply with the Arab peace plan , which entails a military pullout from around restive cities and towns , threatening sanctions unless Assad acts to halt the violence . Clinton told CBS in a separate interview that it was clear Assad 's days were numbered . `` Look , Assad 's going to be gone ; it 's just a question of time .

AMMAN | Fri Nov 18 , 2011 6:11 pm EST AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syria is seeking changes to a planned mission to monitor its implementation of an Arab League peace initiative , the group 's chief said on Friday , on the eve of a deadline for Damascus to take steps to end months of bloodshed . Activists said security forces killed 11 people after weekly prayers , in the latest violence in the crackdown on protests against President Bashar al-Assad , which the United Nations says has killed at least 3,500 people since March . The Arab League has suspended Syria and set the Saturday deadline for it to comply with the Arab peace plan , which entails a military pullout from around restive areas , threatening sanctions unless Assad acts to halt the violence . Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby said the organization was studying a letter from Syria which `` included amendments to the draft protocol regarding the legal status and duties of the monitoring mission of the Arab League to Syria . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said he doubted Syria would respond positively to the Arab League initiative . But he said any international intervention must not be unilateral and should be mandated by the United Nations . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton feared the country could slide into civil war . `` I think there could be a civil war with a very determined and well-armed and eventually well-financed opposition that is , if not directed by , certainly influenced by defectors from the army , '' she told NBC news in Indonesia , where she was attending a regional summit . However , she did not foresee the global community intervening in the same way as it did in Libya . `` There is no appetite for that kind of action vis-a-vis Syria , '' she said , pointing to moves by the Arab League and Turkey . Juppe , speaking alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmed Davutoglu , said France was ready to work with the Syrian opposition and that tougher sanctions were needed on Damascus . British Foreign Secretary William Hague will meet Syrian opposition representatives in London next week in what officials characterized as an intensification of contact with Assad opponents . A Foreign Office source said Britain was `` a long way off '' from recognizing the Syrian National Council or Syrian opposition groups as a government-in-waiting or as the legitimate alternative to Assad . `` What they have to do is come together and form a coherent unified vision of the Syria they want of the future , particularly around the transition period and how to get there , '' the source said . Sanctions already imposed by the European Union and the United States are starting to bite : On Friday , French oil major Total said Syria had halted payments for its oil production activities . Syria 's oil exports , worth $ 400 million a month , a vital source of government earnings , have come to a standstill . But , at the end of a week in which army deserters attacked an intelligence building near Damascus and waged a deadly battle with Assad 's forces , Juppe appeared to call on the opposition not to use army defectors to mount attacks . `` We are making a call to the Syrian opposition . To avoid a civil war , we hope that the army will not be mobilized . This would be a catastrophe , '' Juppe said . Hundreds of people have been killed in Syria , including civilians , army deserters and forces loyal to Assad , since it agreed on November 2 to withdraw troops from urban areas and release political prisoners under an Arab League initiative . Syria says it is trying to implement the deal but has called on neighboring countries to do more to stem a flow of arms to the opposition and end what it says is a media campaign of incitement against Syrian authorities . On Friday activists said security forces shot dead at least 11 people and wounded dozens when they fired to disperse protests in the cities of Deraa , Homs , Hama and the Damascus suburb of Erbin . Syria 's state news agency said two members of the security forces were killed and a third was seriously wounded when a bomb exploded in the province of Hama . Two others were wounded by gunfire in Deraa , it said . Syria has barred most independent journalists from the country , making it difficult to verify reports from activists or officials . Authorities blame the violence on foreign-backed armed groups who they say have killed 1,100 soldiers and police . Protesters called on foreign countries to expel Syrian ambassadors in support of the opposition . `` Whoever fears God should expel the Syrian ambassador '' read a banner at a demonstration in the southern province of Deraa , where the uprising erupted in March . In the eastern province of Hasaka , protesters shouted , `` Why are you afraid ? God is with us ! '' In Homs and Hama , young men dancing arm in arm chanted `` The Free Army is our army , '' referring to army deserters who have waged an escalating campaign of attacks on state targets . Opposition sources said on Wednesday the Free Syrian Army had killed or wounded 20 security police in an assault on an Air Force Intelligence complex on the outskirts of Damascus , the first of its kind in the revolt against Assad . Russia , which opposed Western efforts to secure a Security Council resolution condemning Syria which could have led to U.N. sanctions on Damascus , said the raid showed that the conflict in Syria was `` similar to real civil war . '' France , Britain and Germany plan to ask the U.N. General Assembly 's human rights committee to approve a resolution condemning the violence in Syria , before putting the non-binding measure to a vote in an assembly plenary session . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called on Friday for a cautious response from the international community . `` We are ready to work with the international community but we call for restraint and caution , '' Putin told reporters , asked whether Russia will support calls for Assad to resign or back a U.N. resolution condemning his actions . Meeting his French counterpart Francois Fillon in Moscow , Putin chided France for meddling in the affairs of other nations and reiterated a warning against military intervention . Fillon said that faced with an increasingly `` dramatic '' situation in Syria , France was `` more than ever determined to take action '' against a president `` who has lost all legitimacy in our eyes by firing on his own people . '' Iran 's ambassador to Lebanon said growing international pressure would not topple Syria 's government . `` These threats will not yield any results , '' Ghadanfar Roken Abadi said on Friday . `` Intensifying these threats ... only increases our enthusiasm for popular unity with Syria . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . More frequently than not the Western media campaign against the government of President Bashar Al-Assad quotes various opposition groups regarding the number of people killed and that the army killed them . There is a very radical element in the opposition that will kill their fellow citizens and members of the police and army charged with protecting the citizens of Syria . Why should the government of Syria give in to a small radical minority who is calling for its overthrow when the majority wants to keep the government and are willing to give it time to implement reforms ? This scant radical minority is being armed , funded and egged on by extreme Islamic groups and Gulf Arabs as well as Western governments -LRB- Turkey included -RRB- , who want to see the Arab opposition to Israel and the tyrannical attitude to the Palestinians and neighboring Arab countries diluted . Those vehemently opposed to the Assad government -LRB- I reject calling them a `` regime '' -RRB- both in the West and Arab Gulf have never forced the opposition to meet with the government for discussions . Instead they have allowed opposition exile groups to meet in Turkey to plan against the Government . How would the Turkish government react if Syria permitted the PKK to convene a resistance group in Syria ? What gives France the right to interfere in Syrian domestic politics and demand Assad 's ouster ? They are no longer the colonial power of the land . It appears to me that the West is attempting to compartmentalize the world and in the Middle East that means appointing Turkey as the overlord to return the region to Ottoman style rule . This will be a tragedy for democratic principles and freedoms for Syrians . This will especially affect the Christian population who has been allowed to witness freely in the country free from oppression and limit on their role in civil society . The opposition can not expect to win through violence and destruction . Why is not President Bashar Al Assad given a chance to institute constitutional and civil reform ? Bahrain has committed atrocities in greater proportion to Syria but is allowed to slide because of its alliance with the West and Saudi Arabia . Where is the West to be so vehement and vocal in its reaction to the situation in Yemen ? Where is the West to question why free elections in Qatar will take 2-years while they expect the Syrian Government to turn things around in a matter of months ? Where is the mighty , righteous and `` principled '' West to decry the repression in Saudi Arabia ? Because of its relationship with Iran ? I am attempting to find one truth in the Post by RJNYC . It is the Arab Nations that are reporting the atrocities of the Al-Assad Government , not just the West . Are you calling them Liars ? Everyday we see the Army continuing their assault on a majority-led democratic reform bloodbath on their own people . I sympathize with those who do not know what Freedom means and ask them to give it a chance in Syria . Arab Nations have asked Al-Assad to put away the guns used on the population . His resistance will keep him in power . A power oppressing the majority of Syrian citizens . Their own Army is in a contradiction of right . Not Syria , Al-Assad 's country . SOOO reminiscent of Nazi Germany ! It 's mind boggling that people -LRB- troops -RRB- will BLINDLY follow the orders of a despot ! `` Somethings rotten in Denmark '' ... ... . .

Poor rains earlier this year destroyed 80 percent of wheat crops in the country 's north , northeast and west , leaving impoverished farming communities with little food to eat , said the nine charities which included Oxfam and Save the Children . With food prices almost doubling since last year , families are being forced to skip meals , borrow money or migrate . Access to life-saving aid is now in jeopardy as heavy snowfall will , within weeks , block roads and risk avalanches . `` Villagers are telling us that this year the drought has destroyed everything . Their food stocks are already low , and they are worried about how they will get through the coming months , '' Oxfam 's country director Manohar Shenoy said in a statement . `` Time is running out to be able to provide communities with the help they most desperately need before a harsh winter makes many areas inaccessible . Snow is already falling and many mountainous areas are likely to be cut off within weeks . '' Afghanistan 's harsh winter which lasts from November to March often results in heavy snowfall of up to 13 feet deep , blocking remote mountain passes and leaving hundreds of thousands of villagers isolated for months . As winter sets in , people are feeling the effects of the drought by cutting down on meals , moving across the border to Pakistan and Iran or taking loans to buy food , driving them into debt . Schools have closed as children are being put to work . Despite 14 of Afghanistan 's 34 provinces -- including Faryab and Badakhshan -- being hit by the drought , an October emergency appeal by the United Nations for $ 142 million has only so far only been 7 percent funded by international donors . Aid workers warned that if the international community does not respond and aid supplies are not stockpiled in affected areas in the coming weeks , children are at risk of dying . `` Families are facing being cut off for winter without enough food and clean water , '' said David Skinner , Save the Children 's Afghanistan country director . `` We know children are going hungry , and with malnutrition levels already high in Afghanistan , unless aid efforts are ramped up , children could die because they do not get enough to eat .

Turkey opposes unilateral steps or intervention aimed at `` regime change '' in Syria , the reports said , but it has not ruled out the possibility of more extensive military action if security forces began committing large-scale massacres . The reports , based on a briefing by Turkish officials to selected journalists , came on the day of an Arab League deadline for President Bashar al-Assad 's government to end its repression of anti-government unrest and comply with a peace plan . `` It 's almost certain that Bashar al-Assad 's regime is going down , all the assessments are made based on this assumption . Foreign Ministry sources say that the sooner the regime goes down , the better for Turkey , '' columnist Sedat Ergin wrote in Hurriyet newspaper . `` It is out of the question that Turkey carries out a military intervention to change the regime . However , it takes a flexible stance on opposition groups running activities in Turkey . '' Several thousand Syrians have fled to Turkey in the wake of the repression launched after pro-democracy protests erupted in March . Among them were soldiers who say they deserted rather than shoot their own people , and are now part of the armed resistance against Assad 's forces . Turkey , along with other powers , fear that if Syria slips into civil war it would ignite sectarian and ethnic conflict that could spread elsewhere in the region . Ruled by the Assad family for more than 40 years , Syria 's power circle is based around the Baath party and members of the minority Alawite sect to which the Assad family belong . The Radikal newspaper 's columnist Murat Yetkin quoted one of the Turkish officials saying : `` We believe that with each day that passes under the Assad regime , the threat to stability increases . We believe stability in Syria and in the region will only be possible again under a democratic government . '' The Arab League , and non-Arab Turkey , have threatened economic sanctions unless bloodshed stops . And Turkish officials told the journalists they expected Assad 's government to implode under popular pressure . Turkey wants to avoid a massive influx of people across the border , having been inundated by 500,000 people from Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War . Radikal 's Yetkin said the Turkish military could establish a buffer zone if the Syrian army advanced on a city , like Aleppo , close to the Turkish border . Columnist Asli Aydintasbas of Milliyet newspaper wrote : `` Foreign ministry sources added that Turkey could set up a no-fly buffer zone within Syria if Syrians fleeing the army create a mass wave of migration to Turkey . `` A more extensive military intervention could come on the table only if Syrian regime starts a large-scale massacre in a big city such as Aleppo or Damascus , '' Aydintasbas added . `` Ankara could take a role in a military intervention against Syria only with the international community and following a U.N. Security Council decision . '' Having once cultivated Assad 's friendship , Turkey turned sharply critical during the eight-month-old uprising , as Damascus repeatedly ignored advice to end the violence and make reforms demanded by the people . Attacks on their diplomatic missions in Damascus last weekend , prompted non-Arab Turkey and Arab governments to escalate pressure on Assad . Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Syria was responsible for the breakdown in the relationship . `` Unfortunately , the Syrian regime was reluctant and insincere in carrying out reforms it had promised to . Furthermore , they wanted to quash the opposition through inhumane methods , by shedding blood , '' he told a business forum . `` If there 's a policy change , it 's not Turkey 's but Syria 's change of policy . Syria has not kept the promises it made , neither to the Arab League nor the world , '' he said . `` Its actions have not been sincere and trustworthy .

AMMAN | Sun Nov 20 , 2011 11:54 am EST AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Arab League said on Sunday it had rebuffed a request by Damascus to amend plans for a 500-strong monitoring mission to Syria , after President Bashar al-Assad vowed to continue his crackdown and said he would not surrender to outside pressure . Within hours of Assad ignoring a deadline to halt repression of protesters , residents said two rocket-propelled grenades hit a major ruling party building in Damascus on Sunday , the first such reported attack by insurgents inside the capital . Confronted since March by street demonstrations against 41 years of rule by his family , Assad said he had no choice but to pursue his crackdown on unrest because his foes were armed . `` The conflict will continue and the pressure to subjugate Syria will continue . Syria will not bow down , '' he told Britain 's Sunday Times newspaper . Arab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby rejected Syria 's request to alter a plan for the fact-finding mission -- which would include military personnel and human rights experts -- in a letter to Syria 's foreign minister . `` The additions requested by the Syrian counterpart affect the heart of the protocol and fundamentally change the nature of the mission , '' said the letter , released by the Arab League . Syria 's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the plan as it stood compromised the country 's sovereignty but Damascus had not rejected the mission Moualem said the proposed mission has `` pervasive jurisdiction that reaches the level of ... violating Syrian sovereignty '' and said he would send the Arab League a letter with questions about its role . `` We will reply to the Arab League secretary general by responsibly presenting a number of queries , '' he told a televised news conference in the Syrian capital . The Cairo-based League had given Damascus three days from a meeting on November 16 to abide by a deal to withdraw military forces from restive cities , start talks between the government and opposition and pave the way for an observer team . It was not immediately clear what action the Arab League would take after the deadline passed unheeded by Damascus . The pan-Arab body had threatened sanctions for non-compliance , and it suspended Syria 's membership in a surprise move last week . NO NEW TALKS IN SIGHT `` Although the time-frame has ended , there have been no meetings or calls for meetings except at the level of delegations -LRB- to the League -RRB- , '' a representative of one Arab state at the League told Reuters . In a statement , the League said it remained committed to a peaceful , Arab-engineered solution to the Syrian upheaval , touched off by other Arab popular revolts that have overthrown the autocratic leaders of Egypt , Tunisia and Libya this year . Syrian authorities blame the violence on foreign-backed armed groups which they say have killed some 1,100 soldiers and police . By a United Nations account , more than 3,500 people , mostly civilians , have been killed in the unrest . Assad signaled no retreat from his iron fist policy in a video released after his forces killed 17 more protesters on Saturday . `` The only way is to search for the armed people , chase the armed gangs , prevent the entry of arms and weapons from neighboring countries , prevent sabotage and enforce law and order , '' he said in footage published on the Sunday Times website . On Sunday , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops manning roadblocks in Homs fired on residential areas and wounded three protesters . In the nearby town of Talbiseh , security forces delivered the bodies of two men arrested last month and in Idlib another two civilians were killed in military operations , the British-based group said . Assad said there would be elections in February or March when Syrians would vote for a parliament to create a new constitution and that would include provision for a presidential ballot . The Syrian Free Army , comprising army defectors and based in neighboring Turkey , claimed responsibility for the attack on the Baath Party building in Damascus . There was no independent verification of the claim and Moualem denied that any attack had taken place . But a witness said security police blocked off the square where the building is located and reported seeing smoke rising from it and fire trucks in the area . `` The attack was just before dawn and the building was mostly empty . It seems to have been intended as a message to the regime , '' he said . Syrian authorities have barred most independent journalists from entering the country during the revolt , making it difficult to verify accounts from activists and officials . It was the second reported hit on a high profile target in a week , underscoring a growing opposition challenge to Assad - who blames `` armed terrorist acts '' for the unrest - from a nascent insurgency alongside mostly peaceful protests that have persisted despite the intensifying crackdown . Assad , who inherited power from his father in 2000 , is a member of the Alawite minority community , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam that dominates the state , the army and security apparatus in the majority Sunni Muslim country of 20 million . The Syrian Free Army said the grenade attack was a response to the refusal of Damascus to release tens of thousands of political prisoners and return troops to barracks , as called for by the plan agreed between the Arab League and Damascus . Non-Arab Turkey , once an ally of Assad , is also taking an increasingly tough attitude to Damascus . Turkish newspapers said on Saturday Ankara had contingency plans to create no-fly or buffer zones to protect civilians in neighboring Syria if the bloodshed worsens . `` It 's almost certain that Bashar al-Assad 's regime is going down , all the assessments are made based on this assumption . Foreign Ministry sources say that the sooner the regime goes down , the better for Turkey , '' one Turkish paper reported . Activists in the central city of Homs said the body of Farzat Jarban , an activist who had been filming and broadcasting pro-democracy rallies there , was found dumped near a private hospital on Saturday with two bullet wounds . `` Security police are no longer just shooting protesters , they are targeting activists when they least suspect it , such as when they take their children to school , '' said a doctor from Homs who has fled to Jordan . Tanks and troops deployed in Homs after large anti-Assad protests six months ago . The authorities say they have since arrested tens of `` terrorists '' in the city who have been killing civilians and planting bombs in public places . Moualem said the West and some Arab countries were ignoring the actions of armed gangs in Syria who had been killing people `` according to their identity cards , '' referring to growing reports of sectarian killings between majority Sunni Muslims and Assad 's Alawite community in Homs . But he dismissed fears that the country might be heading toward civil conflict . `` There will not be a civil war , however hard they try to ignite it . '' Dissident colonel Riad al-Asaad , organizing defectors in Syria from his new base in southern Turkey , denied government allegations that adjacent states were allowing arms smuggling into Syria . `` Not a single bullet '' had been smuggled from abroad , he told al Jazeera television . Weapons were brought by defectors , obtained in raids on the regular army or bought from arms dealers inside Syria , he said . Asaad said no foreign military intervention was needed other than providing a no-fly zone and weapons supplies , and that more deserters would swell his Free Syrian Army 's ranks if there were protected zones to which they could flee . `` Soldiers and officers in the army are waiting for the right opportunity , '' he told al Jazeera .
