Some 1,000 barrels -LRB- 42,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day have been gushing from the well since a drilling rig exploded and sank off the Louisiana coast last week . British oil company BP , which leased the rig , said the `` first-of-its-kind '' attempt would take 24 to 36 hours . A nearby oil platform has been evacuated as a precaution . Workers on the rig , the Ocean Endeavour , were taken away because the oil slick was coming dangerously close , said the US Minerals Management Service . Conservation experts say the oil has the potential to damage beaches , barrier islands , wetlands and wildlife reserves along hundreds of miles of coastline in four US states . Whales have been spotted near the spill but they did not appear to be in distress . For now , the weather conditions are keeping the oil away from the shore and it is hoped the waves will break up the heavy crude oil , allowing it to harden and sink back to the ocean floor . The oil is not expected to reach land for at least another three days . Officials are monitoring the environmental effects by boat and plane . BP - which is responsible under federal law for the clean-up - said it was using four submersible vehicles , equipped with cameras and remote-controlled arms , to try to activate a blow-out preventer - a series of pipes and valves that could stop the leak . 1991 : 520m gallons were deliberately released from Iraqi oil tankers during the first Gulf War to impede the US invasion 1979 : 140m gallons were spilt over nine months after a well blow-out in the Bay of Campeche off Mexico 's coast 1979 : 90m gallons leaked from a Greek oil tanker after it collided with another ship off the coast of Trinidad 1983 : 80m gallons leaked into the Gulf over several months after a tanker collided with a drilling platform 1989 : 11m gallons were spilt into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in the Exxon Valdez disaster However , this was a `` highly complex task '' and `` it may not be successful '' , said chief operating officer of BP 's exploration and production unit , Doug Suttles . If the blow-out preventer does not seal off the well , the company intends to place a large dome directly over the leaks to catch the oil and send it up to the surface , where it could be collected by ships . This has been done before , but only in shallow waters , Mr Suttles said . Another alternative is to drill a `` relief well '' intersecting the original well , but he warned that this might take two to three months to stop the flow . BP has brought in more than 30 clean-up vessels and several aircraft to spray dispersant on the oil floating on the surface . Bad weather forced the operation to be suspended at the weekend . In that time , the oil slick was estimated to have grown to about 600 sq miles -LRB- 1,550 sq km -RRB- , officials said . The US Coast Guard has described it as a `` very serious spill '' . Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell said 32 vessels were waiting for conditions to improve to resume the clean-up . She could not say when they would be back at work , but said 23,000 ft -LRB- 7km -RRB- of containment booms had been deployed , 70,000 ft more were ready to go when the effort resumed , and another 50,000 ft were on order .

Five times as much oil as previously thought could be leaking from the well beneath where a rig exploded and sank last week , the US Coast Guard says . Rear Admiral Mary Landry said 5,000 barrels a day were thought to be gushing into the sea off Louisiana . The Department of Homeland Security has designated the spill as one of `` national significance '' . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who is to go to Louisiana to oversee operations , told reporters in Washington that this designation would allow resources to be ordered in from other areas of the US . At the same briefing , a coastguard official said the oil slick was expected to wash ashore on the Gulf Coast on Friday . And Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior David Hayes said the US government had ordered inspections of all deep-water oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico to see if anti-spill regulations were being followed . Andy Gallacher , BBC News , Venice , Louisiana The newly-discovered leak and the news that up to five times as much oil is now leaking from the sunken rig have given a new sense of urgency to the situation here on the Gulf Coast . The huge slick is now close to reaching land and if the weather turns as forecasters predict , the oil may reach the coastline sooner than thought . Attempts at controlled burns may be inevitable but Louisiana is now asking for outside help to try to stem the flow of oil . There is some dispute as to how much oil is now spewing from the sunken rig but all along this delicate coastline , officials are preparing themselves for what could be a huge environmental disaster . The oil slick caused by the leak is 45 miles by 105 miles and is heading towards the coast . If the coastguard estimate is correct , within two months the spill could match the 11 million gallons spilt from the Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska in 1989 . Oil giant BP operated the Deepwater Horizon rig . Its chief operating officer of exploration and production , Doug Suttles , welcomed the US military 's offer of help . He said the company was using remote operative vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- to try to find out how much oil was leaking into the sea . `` This is very , very difficult to estimate , '' Mr Suttles told reporters . `` Down below the surface we actually ca n't meter this oil so we can just observe it ... what our ROV pictures show to us on the sea floor has n't changed since we first saw the leak ... but what we can say based on what we 're picking up on the surface it looks like it is more . '' Mr Suttles estimated something between 1,000 and 5,000 barrels a day was leaking . Meanwhile , a firefighting expert said the disaster may become the biggest oil spill ever . Mike Miller , head of Canadian oil well firefighting company Safety Boss , told the BBC World Service : `` Probably the only thing comparable to this is the Kuwait fires -LRB- following the Gulf War in 1991 -RRB- . `` The Exxon Valdez is going to pale in comparison to this as it goes on . '' Scientists say only a quarter of local marine wildlife survived the Exxon Valdez disaster . The scale of the operation to contain the oil spill and protect both the US coastline and wildlife is unprecedented , with the military and other government agencies collaborating with BP - which had hired the sunken rig - and industry leaders . How the oil has spread Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May Efforts to stem the flow are being complicated by the depth of the leak at the underwater well , which is about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,525 m -RRB- beneath the surface . A coastguard crew has set fire to part of the oil slick in an attempt to save environmentally-fragile wetlands . A `` controlled burn '' of surface oil took place in an area about 30 miles -LRB- 50km -RRB- east of the Mississippi River delta . But Mr Miller warned that burning off leaking oil was not a long-term solution . `` The object of this game is to shut off the flow , '' he said . Engineers are working on a dome-like device to cover oil rising to the surface and pump it to container vessels , but it may be weeks before this is in place . 1991 : 520m gallons were deliberately released from Iraqi oil tankers during the first Gulf War to impede the US invasion 1979 : 140m gallons were spilt over nine months after a well blow-out in the Bay of Campeche off Mexico 's coast 1979 : 90m gallons leaked from a Greek oil tanker after it collided with another ship off the coast of Trinidad 1983 : 80m gallons leaked into the Gulf over several months after a tanker collided with a drilling platform 1989 : 11m gallons were spilt into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in the Exxon Valdez disaster It is feared that work on sealing the leaking well using robotic submersibles might take months . BP is also working on a `` relief well '' to intersect the original well , but this is experimental and could take two to three months to stop the flow . Seventy vessels - oil skimmers , tugboats barges and special recovery boats that separate oil from water - as well as five aeroplanes , were working to spray dispersants and round up oil , BP said . Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the worst oil rig disaster in almost a decade . Louisiana 's coast contains some 40 % of the nation 's wetlands and spawning grounds for countless fish and birds .

The company also faces a massive clean-up bill , plus legal action from those affected and possible damage to its global brand . It is not the first time BP has faced controversy and anger in the US . An explosion at a refinery in south Houston in 2005 killed 15 people and injured 170 , the worst US industrial accident since 1990 . BP was fined a record $ 87m -LRB- # 53m -RRB- after US health and safety experts cited 270 violations at the refinery . It was also fined $ 50m by the Department of Justice in 2007 to settle criminal charges stemming from the explosion . BP leases the Deepwater Horizon rig that suffered a huge explosion on 20 April and later sank . Eleven workers are still missing , presumed dead . As a huge slick heads for the US coastline , the company is now braced for what could be the oil industry 's biggest disaster in history . The oil spill was found to be far worse than initially feared The British-owned firm will be hit by the cost of building a dome-like device that could be lowered over the leaking pipe while a $ 100m relief well is drilled . It is also footing the bill for efforts to stem the leak using robotic submarines . While some legal experts say that Transocean , which owns the rig , was responsible for safety on Deepwater Horizon , BP also faces costly litigation over the accident . A lawsuit has already been filed against BP and Transocean on behalf of the 11 missing rig workers . Two Louisiana shrimpers have also filed a lawsuit for damages against all those operating the rig , including BP . Others named in the action include Transocean and Cameron International , a Houston-based oil well services company . As alarm spread through US coastal communities most at threat from the giant spill , White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said on Thursday that the cost of cleaning up the spill would fall on BP . Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was quick to grasp the gravity of the situation , flying to the US shortly after the accident , and saying his company was being `` very aggressive '' in its approach to the problem . `` This is the biggest response by anyone in the industry ever , and we 're able to do it because we planned for it , '' he said . `` We will be judged by our response . '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer of exploration and production , said the company was spending $ 6m a day trying to clean up the spill and stop the leak . It is more likely to prompt a gut feeling -LRB- in the markets -RRB- that the crisis will be expensive and damaging for the company Russell Corn , corporate analysis firm Diligence But he said it was n't clear what had caused the spillage . He told US broadcaster ABC : `` The company that owned the drilling rig and that owned the blowout preventer was Transocean and they were actually operating the rig . `` At the time the accident happened , the safety devices , we would have believed would have stopped the flow of oil , they did n't do that . We do n't know why they did n't do that and ultimately we will find out . '' BP 's share price has already taken a big hit - dropping by 6.5 % on Thursday after the US Coast Guard said five times as much oil as previously estimated was pouring into the gulf . Oil industry expert Michael Lynch , writing on the website of Gerson Lehrman Group , said containment and remedial costs could easily exceed $ 500m - and a wave of litigation seems sure to follow . `` Control of the well is without question the responsibility of BP , '' he said . `` Should an investigation reveal some fault on the part of Transocean , it is possible they could be held jointly responsible . But all of the indications are that the explosion was the result of a ` kick ' - abnormal pressure from the crude oil reservoir at the bottom of the well driving a volume of natural gas to the surface . `` In any event , the total cost to BP is likely to exceed $ 1bn and could rise to double that . With crude oil prices at their present levels , BP could earn perhaps $ 20bn for 2010 before the disaster charges , '' he added . BP and Transocean officials are working with the US Coast Guard Russell Corn , Deputy CEO of corporate analysis company Diligence , told the BBC the disaster `` will be preoccupying senior management to an increasing degree '' . `` It is more likely to prompt a gut feeling -LRB- in the markets -RRB- that the crisis will be expensive and damaging for the company and will therefore result in some form of negative sentiment around the stock , '' he said . Stephen Cheliotis , of The Centre for Brand Analysis in London , told the BBC that environmental disasters can badly affect the image of oil industry giants . `` It can have a major impact on a brand , and it can damage a brand in the long term , '' he said . `` A lot of people would link , for instance , Exxon with the Exxon Valdez disaster . '' He added that the oil spill had come at a bad time for BP , in a week when it was announcing substantial profits . `` In the eyes of the public this might be seen as crass and might affect their opinion of the company , '' he said . Tom Zara , of brand consultancy Interbrand in New York , said BP had worked to be associated with alternative energy and this incident will remind the world of the `` negative associations '' of fossil fuels . There could therefore be an erosion of the goodwill of the brand overall , he said . How BP responds will be crucial , he added . `` If the brand responds in the wrong way , it may be that long-term damage will be done to their ability to influence governments , NGOs and regulators . But people wo n't stop buying from BP gas stations , '' he said . Although BP has emphasised its speedy response to the disaster - and its co-operation with US investigations into the accident - its reputation in the US has suffered following previous incidents . In December 2009 a Texan jury awarded $ 100m -LRB- # 62m -RRB- in damages to 10 workers at a BP oil refinery who said a leak in 2007 had made them ill . BP maintained that any toxic substance had come from outside the refinery - the same plant that had suffered the explosion in 2005 - and the source of the leak was never identified . But lawyers for the workers described BP as `` a serial polluter '' - and the jury backed their case .

That is five times as much crude than was thought to be spilling from under the Deepwater Horizon rig when it exploded last week . BP said the clean-up operation was costing it millions of dollars a day , but this figure could rise dramatically if the oil hits land .

The US government has designated the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as an `` incident of national significance '' . And the Louisiana has declared a state of emergency .

'' US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said she wanted the `` strongest possible response '' from BP . Weather forecasters have warned that changing winds could drive the oil slick ashore on Friday , and the US Defense Department has called in more military resources to help . President Obama 's press secretary Robert Gibbs said no one was blaming BP , but added : `` Under the Oil Pollution Act , BP pays for all this '' . In an email to BP staff , the company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , called the explosion , in which 11 rig workers are missing and presumed dead , `` a tragic disaster '' .

White House adviser David Axelrod told ABC TV it wanted to know exactly what led to last week 's explosion on the BP-operated rig in the Gulf of Mexico . As many as 5,000 barrels of oil a day are thought to be spilling into the water , threatening US coastal areas . Florida Governor Charlie Crist declared a state of emergency on Friday . The order , which covers Escambia , Santa Rosa , Okaloosa , Walton , Bay and Gulf counties , says the oil slick `` is generally moving in a northerly direction and threatens Florida 's coast '' . Paul Adams , BBC News , Washington Even as frantic efforts continue to minimize the consequences of last week 's oil rig explosion , the political fallout is becoming clear . A month ago , the administration said it was willing to lift a decades-old ban on offshore drilling . It was seen as a gesture to Republican opponents of President Obama 's wider energy policy and his efforts to tackle climate change . But environmentalists were aghast . Now their worst fears are being realized and so the president 's senior adviser has said on TV that there will be no new drilling until there has been what he calls `` an adequate review '' of what 's happened in the Gulf of Mexico . Whether his comments herald a complete rethink on offshore drilling , it is still too early to say . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has already declared a state of emergency . The slick from the wreck of the rig has begun to reach the Louisiana shore and on Friday the state 's National Guard was mobilised . Heavy seas on Friday were pushing the slick towards the coast and over the booms meant to contain it . The US National Weather Service said strong winds , high tides and waves could push the oil into inlets , ponds and lakes in south-east Louisiana over the weekend . Rescuers poised to treat affected wildlife had their first patient on Friday - a young gannett found offshore covered in thick , black oil . It was taken to a treatment center at Fort Jackson , south-east of New Orleans . Mr Axelrod announced the ban on drilling in new areas on ABC 's Good Morning America program . He also defended the administration 's response to the 20 April explosion that destroyed the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon rig saying : `` We had the coast guard in almost immediately . '' Last month President Barack Obama eased a moratorium on new offshore drilling . In a statement outside the White House on Friday , President Obama said he believed oil exploration was an important part of the US economy but it had to be done responsibly . `` BP is ultimately responsible ... for paying the costs of response and clean-up operations but we are fully prepared to meet our responsibilities in all affected communities , '' he said . He said five staging areas had been set up to protect sensitive shorelines and about 1,900 emergency workers and more than 300 ships and aircraft were on the scene . We 're putting everything forth in plans for a worst-case scenario He added that he had ordered a `` thorough review '' of what might be required `` to prevent accidents like this from happening again '' . A BP spokesman in London , Toby Odone , told the BBC his company would face up to its obligations but did not bear sole responsibility for the oil spill . `` We ... take responsibility for the environmental consequences of that accident and we are obviously fully committed to taking all possible steps to contain the spread of the oil spill , '' he said . `` The rig was owned and was the responsibility of Transocean , which is a drilling company which operates all over the world . '' He said BP would continue to prospect for new sources of oil . `` We are responsible to our shareholders to continue to do the thing which we do best , which is to explore for and to produce oil and gas , '' he said . The US government has designated the oil spill an `` incident of national significance '' which allows it to draw on resources from across the country . The wetlands off the Louisiana coast sustain hundreds of wildlife species and a big seafood and fishing industry . The US Coast Guard said it had sent investigators to confirm whether crude oil had begun to wash up on parts of the Louisiana shoreline .

Up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day are thought to be spilling into the water after last week 's explosion on a BP-operated rig , which then sank . President Barack Obama has pledged `` every single available resource '' to help . The US navy has been deployed to help avert a looming environmental disaster . The Coast Guard said it had sent investigators to confirm whether crude oil had begun to wash up on parts of the Louisiana shoreline . President Obama 's administration has banned oil drilling in new areas of the US coast pending investigations into the cause of the oil spill off Louisiana . `` No additional drilling has been authorised and none will until we find out what happened , '' White House adviser David Axelrod told ABC television . Last month President Barack Obama eased a moratorium on new offshore drilling . David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration described the oil spill as a very , very big thing . '' He told the Associated Press news agency that the clean-up efforts could be `` mind-boggling '' . An emergency shrimping season was opened on Thursday to allow fishermen to bring in their catch before it was fouled by the advancing oil . How the oil has spread Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May The US government has designated the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as an `` incident of national significance '' . This allows it to draw on resources from across the country . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency and asked for federal funds to deploy 6,000 National Guard soldiers to help with the clean-up . The Louisiana coastline , with its rich shrimp and oyster beds , is the most threatened by the spill . There are also fears of severe damage to fisheries and wildlife in Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . Navy vessels are helping to deploy booms to contain the spill . President Obama has dispatched high-level administration officials , including Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , to the area . He said they would `` ensure that BP and the entire US government is doing everything possible , not just to respond to this incident , but also to determine its cause '' . Speaking at the White House , Mr Obama also said : `` While BP is ultimately responsible for funding the cost of response and clean-up operations , my administration will continue to use every single available resource at our disposal , including potentially the Department of Defense , to address the incident . '' Meanwhile , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said there was no reason so far to reconsider the president 's recent decision to support plans for increased offshore drilling . `` Our focus right now is : one , the area , the spill ; and two , also to ultimately determine the cause of it and see the impact that that ultimately may or may not have , '' Mr Gibbs said . Eleven workers are still missing , presumed dead , after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April . The US Coast Guard said earlier that up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day - five times the previous estimate - might now be leaking into the water . BP 's chief operating officer of exploration and production , Doug Suttles , said the company was using remote operative vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- to try to find out how much oil was leaking into the sea . April 2010 : Blast at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig causes crude to spill at rate of up to 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 US gallons -RRB- a day 1991 : 520m gallons deliberately released from Iraqi oil tankers to impede US invasion 1989 : 11m gallons spilt into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in the Exxon Valdez disaster 1983 : 80m gallons split off Iran over months after a tanker collides with drilling platform 1979 : 140m gallons leak over nine months after a well explosion off Mexico 's coast 1979 : 90m gallons leak from a Greek oil tanker after collision with another ship off Trinidad `` This is very , very difficult to estimate , '' Mr Suttles told reporters . `` Down below the surface we actually ca n't meter this oil so we can just observe it ... what our ROV pictures show to us on the sea floor has n't changed since we first saw the leak ... but what we can say based on what we 're picking up on the surface it looks like it is more . '' Mr Suttles estimated something between 1,000 and 5,000 barrels a day were leaking . A resident of Bay Saint Louis in Mississippi , John Gerger , told the BBC the smell of oil was becoming stronger along the Gulf Coast . `` It 's as though a diesel truck is parked in the front yard , '' he said . `` The potential impact of the slick could be devastating on an area that has just recovered from -LRB- Hurricane -RRB- Katrina . `` Fishing and shrimping is such an important industry here , and could take a massive hit . Local fishermen have been advised to go out and try to recover as much as they can before the slick approaches land . '' Efforts to stem the flow are being complicated by the depth of the leak at the underwater well , which is about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,525 m -RRB- beneath the surface . Wednesday saw a US Coast Guard crew set fire to part of the oil slick in an attempt to save environmentally-sensitive wetlands . A `` controlled burn '' of surface oil took place in an area about 30 miles -LRB- 50km -RRB- east of the Mississippi River delta . Engineers are working on a dome-like device to cover oil rising to the surface and pump it to container vessels , but it may be weeks before this is in place . It is feared that work on sealing the leaking well using robotic submersibles might take months . BP is also working on a `` relief well '' to intersect the original well , but this is experimental and could take two to three months to stop the flow . Under US law , BP will be expected to meet all the costs of the spill clean-up operation .

At the moment , the only completely accurate answer would appear to be : we do not know . For David Kennedy from the US National Ocean Service , it is `` a very very significant event , and of great concern '' . But Clifford Jones , an oil and gas engineering specialist from the UK 's Aberdeen University , suggests it should not be considered in the same category as the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 , with which it is regularly being compared . It is a threat to the ecosystem , he allows , but says the Exxon Valdez leaked significantly more oil than is likely to flow from the stricken Deepwater Horizons drillsite before pressure in the well drops and stops forcing the oil out . We have to hope for the best , but prepare for the worst , including a true catastrophe for birds '' End Quote Melanie Driscoll National Audubon Society There is no doubt that the oil is coming out much more slowly than is normal from a tanker spill . In principle , this allows the authorities greater time to deal with it - although clearly in this case their efforts have met with mixed success . Oil breaks down naturally in seawater , and in the warm Gulf of Mexico water , this would proceed much faster than in Alaska 's Prince William Sound , where the Exxon Valdez ran aground . In oil spills , as in medicine , prevention is always better than cure . And the first priority for authorities in Louisiana and elsewhere along the Gulf coast is to stop oil washing up on shore . Booms are being deployed , dispersants sprayed , and some patches of oil are being burned . The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority is increasing the flow of water through two inland water channels in an attempt to wash oil-tainted seawater out of ecologically important wetlands . `` Home not only to a thriving fishing industry but also a substantial nature reserve , the potential for damage is enormous , '' says Simon Coxall from the UK 's National Oceanography Centre in Southampton . The coastline sees land interlacing delicately with the sea -LRB- oil slick bottom right -RRB- `` Booming the area off with floating dams to protect these areas is the best option ; but the size of the spill will exhaust the world 's supply of oil booms very quickly . '' What makes this region ecologically special is the unusual patterns of land and sea conjured into existence by the lazy and variegated exit of the mighty Mississippi into the Gulf . Here lie about 25 % of US wetlands - areas rich with life , where human occupancy is low , and birds and other animals can thrive . `` For birds , the timing could not be worse ; they are breeding , nesting and especially vulnerable in many of the places where the oil could come ashore , '' warns Melanie Driscoll , a Louisiana-based bird conservation director with the National Audubon Society , the leading US bird conservation group . `` We have to hope for the best , but prepare for the worst , including a true catastrophe for birds . '' The society 's list of species potentially affected includes resident seabirds , waders and waterfowl , including heron , brown pelicans and oystercatchers , and migratory birds such as plovers , swallows and buntings that use the Gulf wetlands as a stopover . The society points out that for some species , this is the now only home they have , with human development further inland having fenced them into these extremities . Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May The oil slick changes shape and direction rapidly , so predicting where it will make landfall and with what frequency is a hazardous business . Clearly , the longer it takes BP to stem the flow , the greater the chance that its impacts will be felt further around the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , and indeed in its open water . If the oil flows east , it will encounter the seagrass beds that form a key habitat for manatees , among other species . `` If you 've got seagrass beds badly contaminated , clearly the manatees could be seriously affected , '' says Carl-Gustaf Lundin , head of the Marine Programme at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature -LRB- IUCN -RRB- . Here again is a species that is already under severe stress . Fewer than 2,500 adults remain , and the IUCN Red List says the Florida subspecies is expected to decline by at least 20 % over the next 40 years , with various factors implicated , including climate change and impacts from boats . Spawning of bluefin tuna takes place in the oil-affected waters The Gulf waters are already affected annually by fertilisers washing down from southern US farmlands , resulting in a `` dead zone '' where algae have consumed most of the dissolved oxygen and nothing else can grow . The Atlantic bluefin tuna is another possible victim . Over the next six weeks , the western population of this heavily depleted species will spawn in the Gulf of Mexico - principally in the northern portion where the slick is growing . `` The oil would have an impact - it might be toxic to eggs or to the young fry , '' says Dr Lundin . `` Also , the young hide in sargassum -LRB- floating marine plants -RRB- - they 're very vulnerable at this stage - and this could also be affected by oil . '' Each of these possible impacts on wildlife translates into human consequences . For tuna and shrimp , you can read jobs in the fishing industry and food supplies for US consumers . For birds and manatees , you can read tourist income . No two oil spills are alike ; and given the vagaries of winds and sea currents , predicting the likely impact of this one is very difficult . But you can see why local authorities and conservation groups are beginning to be seriously concerned . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

UK markets were closed on Monday , but BP 's Frankfurt-listed shares opened 8 % lower before clawing back some of the losses . Analysts say the costs associated with the slick are uncertain , meaning that the share price was likely to remain volatile while the leak continues . In California , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger withdrew his support for a plan to expand oil exploration off the state 's coast . He said seeing TV images of the spill in the Gulf had changed his mind about the safety of offshore oil platforms in the Pacific Ocean . He had supported more drilling as a way to ease the state 's budget deficit .

It has refused to accept blame for the accident , however , as the failed equipment that caused the explosion was owned and operated by drilling firm Transocean . By mid-afternoon , BP shares closed down 3 % lower at 558.5 p. Transocean shares also continued to fall , down 3.7 % at $ 70.11 in early trading in New York . Its shares have fallen more than 20 % since the explosion . BP said the cost of containing the spill and securing the original well is running at about $ 6m -LRB- # 3.9 m -RRB- a day . `` This figure is rising as activity increases . '' it said in a statement . `` It is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident . '' Experts have warned that the total cost of clearing up the spill , including compensation claims , could run into billions of dollars . Some estimates are as high as $ 15bn . Under US law it is the oilfield operator that has financial responsibility , even if fault lies with a contractor . BP has already said it will pay the costs of the clean-up , though observers suggest it could pursue Transocean at a later stage to try to get some money back . The British oil giant has a two-thirds stake in the field , so its minority partners will also be liable for some of the cost , too . BP said it had begun to drill a relief well to try to isolate the one that is spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico and permanently seal it . It added the drilling is estimated to take three months . `` At the same time , we are continuing with our efforts to stop the leak and control the oil at the seabed , to tackle the oil offshore , and to protect the shoreline through a massive effort together with government agencies and local communities , '' said BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward . Thousands of barrels of oil have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico every day since the Deepwater Horizon rig sank , two days after the initial explosion . The oil is already having a devastating effect on the area 's fishing industry , and officials fear much wider environmental damage if the full slick hits land . BP insures itself through its own insurance company , so there 's little scope to pass the cost on to outside insurers , says BBC World Service business reporter Mark Gregory . `` But even in the worst case scenario , the direct financial burden of the clean-up and paying compensation is unlikely to be a crippling burden for a firm as gigantic as BP , which last year made profits of over $ 40bn , '' our reporter says . Analysts say the main damage could be to the company 's reputation in the US , which has yet to recover from a refinery accident in Texas and pipeline problems in Alaska . The fall in BP 's shares is largely to do with investors ' fears that the reputational damage may undermine BP 's ability to do business in the US , its most important market .

BP has never deployed such a structure at a depth of 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- and difficulties may occur , it says . `` There 's no guarantees , '' BP boss Tony Hayward told AP news agency . `` We 'll undoubtedly encounter some issues as we go through that process . `` But if that was a good outcome , then you would have the principal leak contained by the early part of next week , '' Mr Hayward said . BP has accepted it is `` absolutely responsible '' for cleaning up the spill caused by a blast on a drilling rig . Its shares have plunged more than 15 % since the 22 April explosion . It is estimated that the clean-up could cost BP up to $ 15bn -LRB- # 10bn -RRB- . BP insists that the rig 's contractor , Transocean , was to blame for the accident but , under US law , it has to bear the cost of the clean-up as the operator of the oilfield . Arnold Schwarzenegger : `` It will not happen here '' Both companies are expecting lawsuits over the slick , which US President Barack Obama described as a `` potentially unprecedented '' environmental disaster . Californian Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has withdrawn his support for a plan to expand oil exploration off that state 's coast , saying he has changed his mind about the safety of oil platforms in the Pacific Ocean . After seeing television pictures of the Gulf of Mexico spill , he asked : `` Why would we want to take that kind of risk ? '' Meanwhile , weather conditions have improved considerably , allowing some 3,000 personnel involved in the clean-up operation to get back to work , the BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Louisiana reports . He adds that winds and tides are now forcing the oil slick towards the coast of Florida , where Governor Charlie Crist has added 13 more counties to the six that are already under state of emergency . The slick may not come ashore for at least three days , according to a Coast Guard official . The 40ft -LRB- 12m -RRB- funnel resembles a primitive space rocket with a hole on top to channel oil through a pipe from the sea floor to the surface where it can be collected on a barge , Reuters news agency reports . HOW THE OIL FUNNEL WORKS The funnel is a 40ft tall iron box , weighing 98 tonnes It will be placed over the leak , 5,000 ft down on the seabed BP hopes it will collect 85 % of the leaking oil and pipe it to the surface It is being built at Golden Meadow , near Port Fourchon in southern Louisiana , by Wild Well Control , a company that specialises in controlling oil fires . A team of 25 people is working around the clock on the funnel , marine engineer Jason Holvey told the agency . In theory , the system should collect 85 % of the oil rising from the sea floor . While the precise location of the leak is known , work will have to be carried out in the face of severe technical challenges , not least because of the softness of the sea floor . Asked by Reuters if he was confident it would work , BP spokesman John Curry said : `` We sure hope so . `` If not , we will keep trying other options until something does work . I think we have some great engineers and they have worked very hard . '' The funnel will have to be tested before it can be shipped to the spill site . A back-up funnel is also under construction , AP said . Mr Holvey said similar containment devices had been used in the Gulf before , but in shallow waters . They were used , for instance , after Hurricane Katrina to channel oil to the surface that had spilled from platforms . The US government has been putting pressure on BP to act quickly . In a BBC interview , Hayward dismissed talk of a rift between BP and US officials , saying an `` incredible co-operative relationship '' had been established with the federal authorities . Thousands of barrels of oil have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico every day since the rig sank . Some oil has washed ashore , but officials say the bulk of the slick remains a few miles from the Louisiana coastline . The oil is already having a devastating effect on the area 's fishing industry , and officials fear much wider environmental damage if the full slick hits land . Other efforts being made by BP , according to Mr Hayward , include using undersea robots to work on the safety valve which failed , allowing the oil to escape , and drilling a new well to help relieve the pressure and stem the flow from the rupture .

Oil giant BP says it hopes the 90-tonne device will help to contain the oil . The US is to carry out a controlled burn of some of the leaked oil . But the oil reached a beach for the first time on Thursday , officials confirmed . The spill was set off by an explosion that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig off Louisiana last month . Eleven rig workers died in the explosion , and the ensuing oil leak has since been threatening several southern US states . Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell said teams from the operation Unified Command in Robert , Louisiana , had confirmed oil on the beach , at the south end of the Chandeleur Islands , at Freemason Island . `` This is the first confirmation that Unified Command has received of oil on a shoreline , '' Ms Terrell said . `` It 's largely just sheen , there is no evidence of medium or heavy oil , '' she said . Remote-controlled submarines will now be used to lower the containment device over the leak .

Workers on the rig described hearing `` screaming and hollering '' and said people leapt into the sea to escape . The accounts came from a BP report into last month 's blast , which has led to thousands of barrels of oil leaking . Eye-witnesses also said that safety mechanisms did not function and that workers were taken by surprise . The fresh details about the blast were revealed in interviews with oil rig workers carried out by BP during an internal investigation , Associated Press reports . The revelations came as a giant funnel was lowered over the oil well in a bid to contain oil leaking from it . BP said it might take up to 12 hours for the steel-and-concrete containment device to settle in place , but that everything appeared to be going as planned . It is hoped it will be able to collect as much as 85 % of the leaking oil and begin funnelling it to ships above by Monday . Oil from a slick caused by the leak has washed ashore on islands off Louisiana . Fresh details about the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig emerged on Friday . One worker rescued from the rig , Micah Sandell , reportedly said : `` There was people screaming and hollering . There was people jumping off the side . I 've never seen nothing like that . Another , Dwayne Martinez , said : `` Everybody was scared to death . Nothing went as planned like it was supposed to . '' Mr Martinez continued : `` No kind of alarms . We did n't hear any kind of alarms until there was one explosion . '' The accounts , from BP 's own investigations into the blast last month , describe how the blow-out was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , AP reports . It rapidly expanded as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding , the documents say . Details of the documents were revealed by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , who has worked for BP as a risk assessment consultant . BP spokesman John Curry would not comment on the events described in the internal documents . `` We anticipate all the facts will come out in a full investigation , '' he said . US officials announced on Friday that they had closed Breton National Wildlife Refuge to the public after a silver sheen of oil reached the shoreline . `` The refuge closure is important to keep the public safe , to minimize disturbance to nesting colonial sea birds , and to allow personnel conducting cleanup operations and recovery efforts to work safely and efficiently , '' the US Fish and Wildlife Service said on Friday . The BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani , on Dauphin Island , an inhabited barrier island three miles -LRB- 5km -RRB- off the coast of Alabama , says there is a faint but distinct smell of oil in the air . Some scientists say the oil may be spread more widely . Small , black particles have been found in samples taken from below the surface , away from the visible slick , our correspondent adds . An estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day has been leaking for 18 days from the well , 50 miles off Louisiana , since an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig last month , killing 11 workers . Although the rig was operated by Transocean , it was leased by BP , which is responsible for cleaning the 3 million gallons that have so far leaked , creating a slick covering about 2,000 sq miles -LRB- 5,200 sq km -RRB- . The company hopes the 98-tonne containment device , once operational , will allow it to collect oil leaking out of the well while it attempts to stop the leak altogether by drilling relief wells nearby . HOW THE OIL FUNNEL WORKS The funnel is a 40ft tall iron box , weighing 98 tonnes It will be placed over the leak , 5,000 ft down on the seabed BP hopes it will collect 85 % of the leaking oil and pipe it to the surface Earlier , remote-controlled submersibles guided the 40ft -LRB- 12m -RRB- funnel above the wellhead , some 5,000 ft below the surface . The technology has only ever been used in shallow waters . `` It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin told the Associated Press . `` Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . '' Now that the containment device is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it is stable before the submersibles can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker . `` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 ft and setting it on the head of a pin , '' Mr Salvin added . If the box works , another will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak . Experts warn that there is still a risk that any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . It is also possible for the pipe to the surface to become clogged with ice , and for the subsequent separation of the oil , gas and water to cause an explosion . Fears are growing for the safety of the area 's manifest wildlife In the meantime , residents of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida await news of when the oil will reach their shores . BP said emergency teams had been sent to Freemason Island , a favorite fishing spot for recreational anglers some 30 miles off Louisiana 's coast , to deploy inflatable booms to protect its prime marshland . Fears are growing that sea life may have been severely affected in the area , which includes vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs . The attempt by BP to lower the funnel comes as Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar called for a halt to permits for new exploratory drilling in the US , pending a 30-day investigation into the cause of the oil spill .

We believe that it 'll probably take the next two days to look for opportunities to overcome this challenge .

Doug Suttles , BP , explains the problem with the ` funnel ' `` I would n't say it 's failed yet , '' Mr Suttles added . `` What I would say is what we attempted to do last night did n't work .

More than 160 miles -LRB- 257 km -RRB- of booms had been put out and crews had used nearly 275,000 gallons of dispersants , they added .

A containment device lowered over the well to funnel oil to the surface had to be moved on Saturday after ice-like crystals began accumulating inside it . Some 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day has been flowing into the sea since an explosion on a rig last month . Balls of tar have meanwhile begun washing up on an island off Alabama . Bundles of absorbent material have been laid along the shore of Dauphin Island in an attempt to protect the resort area . Samples of the tar will be analyzed to ascertain whether they come from the massive oil spill off the coast of neighbouring Louisiana . A massive effort to contain what threatens to become an environmental catastrophe has been under way since 20 April , when an explosion killed 11 workers and led to the eventual sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig , 50 miles -LRB- 80km -RRB- off Louisiana . I would n't say it 's failed yet . What I would say is what we attempted to do last night did n't work A sheen of oil began washing ashore on the Chandeleur Islands chain last week , and crews have been laying inflatable booms , spraying chemical dispersants and setting fire to the slick to try to protect local wildlife . Although the Deepwater Horizon was operated by Transocean , it was leased by BP , which is responsible for cleaning the 3.5 million gallons that have so far leaked out of the well below , creating a slick covering about 2,000 sq miles -LRB- 5,200 sq km -RRB- . The 98-tonne concrete-and-steel funnel lowered 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- to the seabed had been BP 's best hope to contain the main leak while it attempted to stop it altogether by drilling relief wells nearby . But a build-up of gas hydrates - crystalline water-based solids resembling ice - inside the device blocked the exit at the top , and it had to be put aside until engineers could decide what to do . HOW THE OIL FUNNEL WORKS The funnel is a 40ft tall iron box , weighing 98 tonnes It will be placed over the leak , 5,000 ft down on the seabed BP hopes it will collect 85 % of the leaking oil and pipe it to the surface `` What we 're working on now is we 're gathering some data to help us with two things . One is another way to do containment , and the second is other ways to actually stop the flow , '' BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told the Reuters news agency on Sunday . `` On the containment side , we 're working two options . One is a smaller dome - we call it the ` top hat ' , and the second is to try to find a way to tap into the riser , the piece of pipe the oil is flowing through , and take it directly from that pipe up to the ship on the surface . '' BP 's Doug Suttles explains hitch The smaller containment dome would theoretically be less likely to get blocked by hydrates because it would contain less water . It could be ready to deploy on Tuesday or Wednesday . Tapping into the riser would be difficult , experts say . Another solution might be to plug up the blow-out preventer at the well-head , which failed to cut the flow after the explosion on the rig last month , with a `` junk shot '' of rubber and another material , Mr Suttles said . Meanwhile , a relief well is being drilled - considered a more permanent solution to the leak - but that is weeks from completion .

The graphic above shows the scene 1,524 m -LRB- 5,000 feet -RRB- beneath the waves where oil is leaking out of the damaged remnants of the oil well apparatus . Below we explain the various attempts to stem the leak from the damaged oil lines on the sea bed . Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125-tonne , 18-metre -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor . However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice-like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy . Instead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site . Dubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak . To prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas . The top hat is 1.5 m -LRB- 5 feet -RRB- high and 1.2 m in diameter . Two special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe . This should prevent the build-up of hydrates . Once in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface . BP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface . This time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build-up of hydrates . BACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Meanwhile , four robotic submersibles have been trying to activate the blow-out preventer , a set of huge valves designed to seal the well . Experts believe the blow-out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- must have partially triggered otherwise the flow of oil to the surface would be more extreme than it is . In an unusual move , BP , the British oil giant which contracted another company to drill the well , has also started using dispersant chemicals down at the leak site as well as on the surface . A long-term solution is also in progress - drilling a relief well which can tap into the leaking well and take the pressure off the broken well . However , it could be three months before this is operational . Up to five thousand barrels a day are thought to be leaking from the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig which sank on 22 April after an explosion in which 11 workers lost their lives . The delicate eco-system of the gulf coastline is rich in wildlife including the brown pelican , many species of duck , turtles , and whales . There are fears that the disaster could reach the scale of the 11m gallon Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska in 1989 . How the oil has spread Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May Emergency teams are using several methods in attempts to deal with the oil at the surface , which has created a slick covering about 2,000 sq miles -LRB- 5,200 sq km -RRB- . More than 275 vessels , including skimmers , tugs , barges and recovery vessels , are being used . Skimmers , which skate over the water , brushing up the oil are also being employed and more than 90,000 barrels of oil-water mix have been removed . Around 190 miles of floating boom are being used as part of the efforts to stop oil reaching the coast . A US charity is even making booms out of nylon tights , animal fur and human hair . Hair donations have been sent from around the world to help make the special booms , which will be laid on beaches to soak up any oil that washes ashore . Dispersant chemicals , rather like soap , are being sprayed from ships and aircraft in an effort to help break down the oil - which is also degraded by wind and waves . Burning is another method used to tackle oil spills - although it can be tricky to carry out and has associated environmental risks such as toxic smoke . So far emergency crews have had little success in containing the spill using those methods . New underwater technology aimed at stopping crude oil rising to the surface at the site of the leak has had some success .

BP spokesman Mark Proegler said engineers began pumping dispersant on the site on Monday morning .

Lamar McKay , head of BP America , focused on a critical safety device , the 450-tonne blowout protector -LRB- BOP -RRB- . It was supposed to shut off oil flow on the ocean floor in the event of a well blowout , but he said it had `` failed to operate '' . He noted that BP had not owned the rig and so `` responsibility for the safety of drilling operations '' belonged to Transocean . But Transocean chief executive Steven Newman said there was no reason to believe the BOP had been at fault . `` Offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' he said . He also pinned blame on the failure of a cement oil-well casing built by BP contractor Halliburton . However , Halliburton executive Tim Probert argued his firm had followed all requirements set out by BP and industry practices . Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman said the oil rig explosion had probably been due to a `` cascade of errors , technical , human and regulatory '' . The BBC 's North America editor says the details of the engineering may be obscure , but the motivation is clear enough : no-one wants to say the loss of lives , the environmental impact or the economic effect was their fault . Accepting blame will have huge financial consequences .

Critics say the MMS - a branch of Mr Salazar 's Department of the Interior - has been riddled with conflicts of interest . They argue that the two core responsibilities of the MMS are diametrically opposed - making money off the industry by collecting royalties , while cracking down on it in ways that may affect the industry 's bottom line . A 2008 internal investigation found some MMS employees had taken drugs and had sex with energy company representatives . Some staff had also accepted gifts and free holidays amid `` a culture of ethical failure '' , according to the investigation . The interior secretary has been conducting a 30-day review of offshore drilling at the request of President Obama .

The hairy booms wo n't plug leaks on the seabed , but will be floated off beaches to mop up oil washing towards shore . Making one of the oil spill hair booms How 's your hair - shower-fresh , or a bit greasy around the roots ? We wash our hair because it collects the oils our bodies produce . And it 's this property of hair - and fur and wool - that means it will be used to help tackling the oil spewing from BP 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico . It 's adsorbent rather than absorbent , meaning oil clings to the many tiny scales on each strand of hair . `` Each follicle -LRB- strand -RRB- of hair has an enormous amount of surface area . It 's not soaking up the oil , it 's not blowing up like a sponge - the oil is coating the outside , '' says Lisa Gautier , founder of the ecological charity Matter of Trust , which runs an international Hair for Oil Spills program to collect off-cuts from hair salons and pet groomers , sheep farmers and individuals . The donated hair and fur is then stuffed into nylon tights to make sausage-shaped booms to string out along beaches , as officials have said there are not enough manufactured booms to protect the coastline from the looming oil slick . Oil coats surface of each strand of hair or fur This is because hair is adsorbent , not absorbent like a sponge `` Hair is an extremely efficient material for taking in all kinds of oils including petroleum - it clings to the hair because it 's spiky , '' says Ms Gautier . The technique has been tested and approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency . It was used in past disasters , such as 2007 's Cosco Busan oil spill in San Francisco Bay and in the Philippines in 2006 , when prisoners shaved their heads and chests to donate hair to the clean-up effort . And in the first Iraq war in 1991 , when retreating Iraqi soldiers released million tonnes of oil into the Persian Gulf , New Zealand sent booms filled with sheep 's wool that could soak up 40 times their weight in oil to help with the clean-up . At the time , Malcolm Fox , a chemist and visiting professor at Leeds University , studied the use of low-grade wool in oil spill clean-ups . `` An oil company sent me a drum of the crude oil\\/water emulsion and we tried soaking it up with mats of the wool . It was reasonably successful and we recycled the wool mats by putting them through an old washing mangle to recover the oil , which could also be used again . '' Human hair , however , proved more effective - in part because the wool had been processed and so lost its lanolin coating , which naturally repels water and holds grease to keep sheep warm . `` Human hair grease acts as a spreading agent , to help the oil form a film on the surface . '' The idea of using human hair to mop up oil spills dates from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 . Watching the unfolding disaster on television , Alabama hair stylist Phil McCory noticed how hard it was for volunteers to clean oil from otters ' fur , and thought to himself : `` If animal fur can trap and hold spilled oil , why ca n't human hair ? '' Prisoners in Manila bagged up their hair for a 2006 oil spill So he staged a home oil spill to test this theory , pouring a gallon of used motor oil into his son 's paddling pool . He then dunked in a pair of his wife 's pantyhose stuffed with clippings from his salon . Within two minutes , the DIY boom had sucked up all the oil . He then parlayed this brainwave into a business making oil spill mats from hair purchased in China . For the past 10 years , his company has worked with the Matter of Trust charity to establish a hair recycling system to find a use for the all the hair and fur cut off by stylists and pet groomers each day . The charity 's figures suggest this amounts to 370,000 pounds of hair , and 300,000 pounds of fur , a day in the US alone . While fur , horse hair and feathers are also used in the booms , the charity says human hair seems to be most effective as it has less natural oil and so more capacity to catch spilled oil . A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines To make a hair boom , first cut the legs off a pair of tights , and fit the open end over a wide plastic pipe - this makes it easier to feed the hair and fur into the stocking . Once it 's full , tie off the end and cover the resulting sausage in a strong mesh . While the charity welcomes all donations , there are a few caveats - it prefers freshly-washed hair and fur , and hair to be from the head only . This is because each boom is hand-made , and its volunteers are unlikely to want to handle filthy - or intimate - off-cuts . But what happens to all the oil-soaked hair ? Among the options tried by the charity include feeding the whole mess to worms to break down into fertiliser .

Samples from the carcasses found in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama since 2 May have been sent for testing . A National Marine Fisheries Service official said none of them had obvious signs of oil and it was common for dead dolphins to wash up at this time of year , when they are in shallow waters to calve . The dome is meant to funnel some of the escaping oil to a waiting tanker on the surface . It is unclear what killed six dolphins on the Gulf Coast this month `` The ` top hat ' was lowered to the seabed floor last night and is presently ... in the immediate area of the leak and the plan is to have that positioned over the leak and functioning by the end of the week , '' BP 's Bryan Ferguson told AFP news agency . Containment chambers like this have been used to tackle well and pipeline leaks in the past but not at such a depth - 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,525 m -RRB- . At 4ft -LRB- 1.2 m -RRB- in diameter and 5ft -LRB- 1.5 m -RRB- in height , it is much smaller than the first , 40ft dome . BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said engineers also hoped to link a second pipe to the end of the pipe supposed to pump oil from the sea floor before the explosion . This pipe would funnel away oil that had collected in the original piping , or riser . He said the pipe could arrive on Wednesday and be usable by Thursday or Friday . National Guard soldiers have been dropping sandbags from helicopters into a channel near Grand Isle , Louisiana , in a desperate bid to keep the slick out of wetlands . The area 's ecosystem is home to pelicans , gulls and sea creatures vital to the local fishing economy . Unemployment assistance , help for fishermen and money for food stamps are all foreseen in the legislation submitted to Congress on Wednesday . If this is like other catastrophic failures of technological systems in modern history , whether it was the sinking of the Titanic , Three Mile Island , or the loss of the Challenger , we will likely discover that there was a cascade of failures and technical and human and regulatory errors The legislation calls for oil companies to pay a 1 % per barrel tax increase to the existing Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , a senior administration official said in Washington . Jeff Liebman , acting deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget , said the administration hoped to get it passed in the next few weeks . US House of Representatives investigators say they have uncovered significant problems with one of the well 's crucial safety devices , its blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- , which may have contributed to the explosion . The BOP , built by Cameron International , had a leak in its hydraulic system and lacked the power to cut through joints to seal the drill pipe , Representative Henry Waxman told a hearing on the spill . Just hours before the explosion , the well failed a negative pressure test , he said , citing BP documents received by the Energy and Commerce Committee . The hearing was also told that the BOP had been modified , which made it difficult to operate after the accident , and its emergency back-up controls may have failed because the explosion that destroyed the rig also disabled communications preventing workers from sending signals underwater . On Tuesday , BP and other oil industry executives traded blame in Congress .

Earlier , the British oil giant said it hoped the `` top hat '' , which is now on the seabed , would be deployed by Thursday at the broken pipeline . An attempt to use a larger containment dome failed on Sunday when it became clogged with ice and gas . The well is spewing out some 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day . The `` top hat '' is meant to siphon oil into container ships but there is no guarantee that the plan will work , the BBC 's Andy Gallacher reports . The first of two relief wells being drilled is not expected to be ready for some three months . Emergency teams are using several methods in their attempts to deal with the oil at the surface . Thousands of clean-up crews , soldiers and volunteers have all been deployed to keep the expanding oil slick from damaging the coastlines of four states . Around 1.5 m ft of floating booms are being used as part of the efforts to stop oil reaching the coast , Reuters reports . A US charity is even making booms out of nylon tights , animal fur and human hair . Hair donations have been sent from around the world to help make the special booms , which will be laid on beaches to soak up any oil that washes ashore . Eleven people died when an explosion - thought to have occurred after a surge of methane gas from deep within the well - destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . The huge oil spill has so far cost BP - which is in charge of the clean-up operation - $ 450m -LRB- # 300m -RRB- . The total bill could be as high as $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.6 bn -RRB- , analysts say . `` Estimates run from between $ 3bn to $ 20bn . Certainly , there 's the clean-up costs . `` And the associated lawsuits , which at this stage looks like it could be one of the largest class actions in US history '' , oil analyst Greg Smith of stock market research house Fat Prophets told the BBC . `` From our point of view , we would think somewhere mid-range - around the $ 10bn mark , '' he adds . Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125-tonne , 18-metre -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor . However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice-like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy . Instead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site . Dubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak . To prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas . The top hat is 1.5 m -LRB- 5 feet -RRB- high and 1.2 m in diameter . Two special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe . This should prevent the build-up of hydrates . Once in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface . BP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface . This time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build-up of hydrates .

The attempt to divert the oil flow came as workers readied a so-called `` top hat '' containment dome to be lowered over the leak . Some scientists have significantly raised their estimate of the rate of oil flow , as the surface slick has grown to 3,650 sq miles -LRB- 9,500 sq km -RRB- . Several US senators have proposed a ban on drilling off the Pacific coast . Five thousand feet -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- below the surface on Friday , remote-controlled robots were attempting to thread a six-inch -LRB- 15cm -RRB- tube surrounded by a stopper into the 21-inch pipe spewing crude oil and natural gas at a high rate into the water . If the attempt is successful , the tube could siphon leaking oil and gas into a tanker on the surface , allowing oil workers to concentrate on cleaning up the already-spilled crude . In addition , BP was preparing to deploy a metal box , or top hat , to cap the leak . A previous attempt to lower a bigger box on to the well site failed . President Barack Obama has stressed that BP must pay for the clean-up from the disaster . Senators from coastal states have proposed a ban on oil drilling on the Pacific coast . On Friday , Mr Obama was due to meet advisers to discuss the spill response , and he is expected to discuss the latest efforts to plug the leak in remarks later . As of late Thursday , more than 500 vessels and 13,000 people were involved in the spill containment and clean-up effort . Workers had deployed more than 1.4 million feet of boom to arrest the spread , and had dumped more than 475,000 gallons of chemical dispersant into the gulf waters . Meanwhile , oil has begun washing ashore on the barrier islands in the gulf in the form of tar balls and patties . US officials forecast the slick could make landfall on Saturday in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama . The spill is poised to become the worst environmental disaster in US history . Some scientists have begun to cast doubt on official estimates of the rate of oil flow , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels of oil per day dramatically understates the amount . Florida State University oceanographer Ian MacDonald has estimated the rate is four or five times the government figure , the New York Times reported . Other researchers who have analyzed underwater video of the leak released by BP told US news media outlets the leak was spewing about 70,000 barrels per day , with a margin of error of plus or minus 20 % . The spill began on 20 April , when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , leased by BP from Swiss drilling giant Transocean , exploded into flames and sank two days later , killing 11 workers . In testimony before US House and Senate committees this week , BP , Transocean and US oil services company Halliburton each pointed the finger of blame at the others .

Crude has already contaminated beaches in Louisiana and Alabama since a drilling rig blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers . US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano noted in a letter on Saturday to BP chief executive Tony Hayward that the firm had repeatedly pledged to assume all costs for the spill . BP 's battle with oil leak continues `` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur , '' the letter continued . `` Therefore , in the event that our understanding is inaccurate , we request immediate public clarification of BP 's true intentions . '' The officials said they hoped BP would not seek to rely on a statutory cap on how much oil companies must pay for such leaks . It is not clear what prompted the letter as BP said last week the $ 75m cap was irrelevant and the firm would pay for all costs and legitimate claims . President Obama is doing his best to make sure the wave of blame that is bound to follow does not lap against the doors of the White House On Friday , President Barack Obama suggested BP and other firms were trying to duck responsibility , as he condemned a `` ridiculous spectacle '' of oil executives shifting blame in US congressional hearings . Mr Obama has stopped all new drilling for the moment and a number of politicians want that to become permanent . Early on Friday , BP began trying to thread a 6in-wide -LRB- 15cm -RRB- tube into a damaged 21in-wide pipe on the ocean floor a mile beneath the surface . Like a long straw , the tube is intended to slurp oil to a ship on the surface , and a stopper surrounding it would stem the flow of crude into the sea . After its first attempt failed , the company announced it would try again on Saturday night . BP also said the underwater chemical dispersants it began to use on Friday were already resulting in less oil rising to the top of the ocean . BP 's chief executive earlier told the BBC 's Today program he hoped the leak could be stopped within 10 days . But the worst case scenario was `` more than that , and it 's impossible to say how much more '' , Mr Hayward added . A week ago , BP tried to cap the well with a 100-tonne box , but gave up after it became encrusted with ice crystals . Some scientists have begun to cast doubt on official estimates of the rate of oil flow , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels of oil per day dramatically understates the real amount .

Tarballs of oil are said to be more manageable It would , the official said , be similar to panels created to investigate the space shuttle Challenger disaster and the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island . It would study oil industry practices , rig safety , regulation and governmental oversight , as well as the `` structure and functions '' of the MMS , an official told Reuters news agency .

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also appeared at Monday 's hearing , the first time senators were able to question officials about the response to the 20 April disaster . She said the government was monitoring the loop current very closely and were treating it as if it were a coastline . `` In other words ... if we were to see that the oil really was beginning to move toward the loop current we would begin doing some things in the way of dispersant and booming ... as if the loop current itself were a piece of the coast , '' she said . Senator Joseph Lieberman , who chairs the committee , said at the hearing that the government should not allow any new deep water wells to get permits or be drilled until the industry could prove it can prevent another failure of drilling equipment in deep waters or contain oil spills more effectively . `` I say that with regret because I know how important offshore American oil is to our nation 's energy independence , '' he said . `` But the US government has a responsibility to the public safety that is more important and that responsibility , I fear , was not fulfilled in this case .

But Mr McKay told senators : `` I think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they 're behaving .

'' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also appeared at Monday 's hearing , the first time senators were able to question officials about the response to the 20 April disaster . Tarballs of oil are said to be more manageable She said the government was monitoring the loop current very closely and treating it as if it were a coastline . `` In other words ... if we were to see that the oil really was beginning to move toward the loop current we would begin doing some things in the way of dispersant and booming ... as if the loop current itself were a piece of the coast , '' she said . Senator Joseph Lieberman , who chairs the committee , said at the hearing that the government should not allow any new deep water wells to get permits or be drilled until the industry could prove it could prevent another failure of drilling equipment in deep waters or contain oil spills more effectively . BP America 's president , Lamar McKay , returned to the Senate for the hearing , having already faced questions along with other oil industry executives last week . I think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they 're behaving Scientists said on Sunday they had found vast underwater plumes of oil , one 10 miles long and a mile wide , lending weight to the fears of those who believe the actual spill could be many times greater than the estimate of 5,000 barrels daily . But Mr McKay told senators : `` I think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they 're behaving . '' The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cast doubt on the plume reports , saying no definitive conclusions had been reached because the findings were unverified . BP also said on Monday it had received 15,000 claims for compensation , and had already paid out on 2,500 claims . Experts warn that BP 's total liability for the spill could run into billions of dollars .

Satellite images released by the European Space Agency -LRB- ESA -RRB- depict a streak of oil stretching south from the main slick into the Loop Current - a body of fast-flowing water coming from the Caribbean which the agency says is likely to propel oil towards Florida within six days . The Loop Current could carry the oil around Florida and into the Atlantic Scientists at the NOAA , the US government 's own climate body , broadly share that analysis , but say the oil is a `` light sheen '' representing just a small portion of the overall amount . The oil would be `` highly weathered '' if it reached Florida , or could evaporate en route , it said . The scientists warned that the turbulent Loop Current could mix the oil and water , making it difficult to track the oil 's progress in the coming days .

It is unclear where the tar balls came from , Coast Guard officials said .

Observers say the rare talks demonstrate a concern that the oil may be carried by currents far from the site of the Deepwater Horizon disaster .

Daniel Becnel asked that the growing number of cases against oil companies BP , Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron be combined and heard in Louisiana , the Associated Press news agency reported . The lawsuits have been filed by commercial fishermen , restaurants , hotels and property owners and others who say the oil spill has cost them income . A BP executive said this week that the company had paid out $ 15m -LRB- # 10.4 m -RRB- in claims , much of it to shrimpers and commercial fishermen who have little or no income because of the spill . Meanwhile , astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station have said they could see the oil spill while passing over the Gulf of Mexico . `` It looks very scary , '' Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov told reporters via a video link .

A day earlier , BP 's chief operating officer Doug Suttles said the process - never attempted at such depths before - stood a 60-70 % chance of working . If the `` top kill '' failed there was a chance the flow of oil could temporarily be increased , he said , in which case BP would immediately install a new containment device to go over the old riser . BP is also looking at alternative short-term methods to stem the flow , including a new way to siphon oil from the well , Reuters news agency reports . The Senate Energy and National Resources Committee will hold a hearing later to discuss who bears the responsibility for the oil spill clean-up and recovery . Meanwhile , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said a report detailing how staff in the Louisiana office of the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , which regulates the oil industry , had violated ethics rules by accepting sports tickets and free lunches from oil and gas companies was very worrying . `` This deeply disturbing report is further evidence of the cosy relationship between some elements of MMS and the oil and gas industry , '' he said . In a statement late on Monday , BP said much investigation remained to be done into the causes of the spill , including examining large pieces of equipment - such as the blowout preventer - which are scattered on the seafloor . Environmentalists are concerned for the welfare of coastal birds and sealife It is sharing the findings of its investigation with administration officials . `` A number of companies are involved , including BP , and it is simply too early - and not up to us - to say who is at fault , '' chief executive Tony Hayward said in a statement . Of the seven control mechanisms under scrutiny , four involve the blowout preventer - owned by Transocean - and the other three the cementing and casing of the wellhead , which was the responsibility of Halliburton , AP reports . Transocean is also carrying out its own investigation . The White House said on Tuesday that BP was complying with the government 's request to use smaller quantities of a toxic dispersant to fight the spill , following concerns over its impact on marine life . But BP said it was finding it hard to source readily available supplies of an alternative , less toxic dispersant . At a meeting on Capitol Hill , Mr Obama urged Senate Republicans to work with him to pass energy legislation currently before Congress , the White House said . `` The president told the conference that the Gulf oil disaster should heighten our sense of urgency to hasten the development of new , clean energy sources that will promote energy independence and good-paying American jobs , '' it said in a statement . The report on the spill due to be sent to Mr Obama on Thursday may influence whether or not the Interior Department starts to issue offshore drilling permits again . The administration has fended off charges that offshore drilling permits and environmental waivers continue to be granted despite a moratorium announced by the president . The US government stepped up its rhetoric towards BP on Monday , when three cabinet secretaries and senators toured the region . BP has taken out a number of full-page newspaper advertisements in a bid to reassure the public it is working to mitigate the effects of the spill . It has also promised $ 500m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- to study the impact of the spill and response efforts on the environment over the next 10 years .

Tony Hayward said the procedure would begin on Wednesday if considered safe . Teams have been carrying out diagnostic tests to ensure the `` top kill '' method is feasible and will not backfire . The government has approved the measure . Meanwhile , a congressional memo has revealed there were several warning signs shortly before the rig exploded . According to the document , BP officials told congressional investigators on Tuesday that a decision to continue drilling after unusual pressure readings may have been a `` fundamental mistake '' . BP said the buildup of pressure was an `` indicator of a very large abnormality '' in the well , the memo by representatives Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak said . Problems were also identified with equipment including the blowout preventer - meant to shut down the well in the case of emergency - and potential gas leakage in the hours prior to the 20 April explosion , the memo said . Speaking on US television on Wednesday , Mr Hayward said : `` What we 're seeing here is a whole series of failures . We 've identified ... at least seven . `` It 's very clear that much more needs to be put in place to deal with this situation should it ever occur again . '' He added : `` It 's clear that this will be a transforming event in the history of deep water exploration . '' Questions were raised in the memo as to whether proper procedures were followed in carrying out pressure testing and other activities in the 24 hours before the explosion . A worker for Transocean , the Deepwater Horizon rig 's owner , told US Coast Guard investigators he had heard senior managers complaining that BP was `` taking shortcuts '' by using seawater instead of drilling mud in the well before the blowout , according to witness statements seen by the Associated Press news agency . BP is under intense pressure to succeed with its latest attempt to stem the leak , after previous measures failed . `` I have to say that it will be a day or two before we can have certainty that it 's worked , '' Mr Hayward told the US network NBC 's Today show . If pressure and density sufficient , oil and gas flow stops Coast Guard Adm Mary Landry said federal authorities had approved the `` top kill '' measure - the final authorisation needed for BP to decide whether to go ahead . Speaking on a visit to California , President Barack Obama said : `` If it 's successful , and there 's no guarantee , it should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of oil now streaming into the Gulf from the sea floor . '' He said the `` heartbreaking '' spill highlighted the need to find alternative energy sources . `` We will not rest until this well is shut , the environment is repaired and the clean-up is complete , '' he added . If the new procedure is used , heavy drilling fluids - such as mud - will be injected into the well about a mile -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- underwater . Engineers hope to follow this with cement , designed to seal the well . The company has said it estimates a 60-70 % chance of success . Officials say the method has been used before in other areas of the world , but not at the depths required to stem the oil from the Deepwater rig . If the operation goes ahead , it can be watched via a live video stream of the site , which currently shows plumes of oil and gas escaping from the well . A conservative estimate of the amount of oil escaping is about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons , 795,000 litres -RRB- a day , while some scientists say it could be many times greater . The US government has declared a `` fishery disaster '' in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama . Ultra-deepwater rigs and other equipment are at the site A massive containment and clean-up operation is under way , as the oil reaches the beaches and vulnerable marshlands of a 150-mile stretch of coast . Some workers involved in the operation are complaining of health problems after contact with oil and chemical dispersants , the Los Angeles Times reports . The fishermen , who say they are suffering from nausea , dizziness and breathing problems , told the paper they were not issued with special equipment but were simply told by BP not to pick up oil waste . Louisiana Congressman Charlie Melancon has urged the federal government to set up mobile clinics in rural area to treat those affected , the paper reports . BP has said conditions are being monitored . Mr Obama is due to make his second visit to the Gulf of Mexico region on Friday . His visit will come a day after he receives a report into offshore drilling that is expected to recommend tougher regulations and demand more safeguards . In the tests which began on Tuesday , five spots on the well 's crippled five-story blowout preventer were being checked to make sure it could withstand the heavy force of the injection . A weak spot in the device could blow under the pressure , causing a brand new leak at the site 50 miles -LRB- 80km -RRB- off the Louisiana coast .

The BP oil spill has cast US energy policy in a new light Congressmen were lining up to heap scorn on both BP 's response to the spill and its prior safety record in the United States . Although BP has not been called British Petroleum for the best part of a decade , it has become fashionable for administration officials and congressmen to refer to it pointedly by its former name . But despite the ill-feeling directed towards Britain 's biggest company , the more resounding lesson to come from the catastrophe could be for the United States and its relationship with its offshore oil industry . `` The United States uses 25 % of the world 's oil , yet we only have 3 % of those reserves in the United States , '' House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Henry Waxman told the BBC . It 's so illogical that we 're continuing to rely on oil and we still have n't had the courage to move away to a better energy policy , '' he added . `` And part of the reason we have not moved away has been the influence of the oil companies themselves . '' That influence has led US politicians to look not only at the performance of companies like BP in the rich oilfields beyond America 's continental shelf , but to the performance of the federal agency which should have been keeping a close eye on the risky business of deep water oil exploration . You do n't hear the mantra of ` drill , baby , drill ' right now as much as you did a month ago in congress To gain permission to drill anywhere in the Gulf of Mexico , BP has to submit a document called an oil spill response plan . In its plan for Deepwater Horizon , BP claimed that in the unlikely event of a spill , it could cope with a worst-case scenario around 30 times bigger than the spill it is currently grappling with . The federal regulator , the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , also decided to exempt BP from supplying an environmental assessment of Deepwater Horizon 's impact on the Gulf of Mexico , because it decided a spill would be small and unlikely to reach shore . Kieran Suckling , director of the American environmental NGO , the Center for Biological Diversity , believes closer oversight by the MMS could have prevented the spill . `` The environmental documents would no longer be written by BP and the oil industry , they would have been written by government scientists , giving us an independent assessment of what was happening out there , '' he said . `` They could have required more safety equipment , required a better clean-up plan , a very large bond or they could have rejected the permit altogether and said ` no , we 're not going to issue this permit , this project is just too dangerous ' . '' US President Barack Obama has already promised an end to what he calls the ` cosy relationship ' between the MMS and the oil industry . But where does that leave BP , a company which was not so long ago reckoned to hold one in every six pounds invested by UK pension funds ? `` It will dent their reputation , it will give them a black eye , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst from the US investment bank Oppenheimer and Co. . It 's unfortunate that right now there are people who have always been against domestic US exploration that are trying to take advantage of this situation `` Will they recover from it ? Depending on how severe this hit is going to be financially and on their reputation , they will recover . `` It 's a strong company with lots of resources and a lot of history and a good management team , '' he added . `` It will take time , will cost a lot of money and life will go on . '' However , that assessment is based on the well being shut off soon . And whatever the result of that operation , Gheit is sure that what will follow is a wave of regulation which the US oil lobby has fought long and hard to avoid . For those on Capitol Hill who would like to see an America less dependent on oil , Deepwater Horizon could be a turning point . `` You do n't hear the mantra of ` drill , baby , drill ' right now as much as you did a month ago in Congress , '' said Democratic Representative Raul Grijalva . `` This could put more emphasis on alternatives and counter the economic argument by saying there is a cost if we do n't do this right , and the cost is ... borne by the US taxpayer , '' he argued . But the oil industry still has friends on Capitol Hill who think responsibility for Deepwater Horizon lies not with the industry as a whole , but with BP and the federal government . `` We 've got experience from 30 years of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that those safety mechanisms work when they 're used properly . What happened in this explosion is something that should not have happened , '' said Republican Representative Steve Scalise , whose Louisiana district is on the Gulf of Mexico . `` It 's unfortunate that right now there are people who have always been against domestic US exploration that are trying to take advantage of this situation , and to use it as an opportunity to say , ' I told you so , we should n't drill in the United States . ' `` That would be like raising the white flag because ultimately that would make the US even more dependent on the Middle East for oil . `` We have got to do is say ` we 're not going to tolerate this kind of failure of safety standards ' . We 've got to hold every company , including BP to that standard . '' The Report is on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday , 27 May at 2000 BST .

Eleven workers were killed in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . Millions of gallons of oil have poured into the sea since then . Adm Allen told US media the `` top kill '' procedure , which began on Wednesday , has pumped enough drilling fluid to block some of the oil and gas escaping from the well . Earlier , he had indicated that all the leaking oil and gas had been stopped , telling National Public Radio that BP engineers had `` been able to force mud down and not allow any hydrocarbons to come up .

The move comes after an opinion poll said 60 % of Americans were unhappy with the government 's response . BP has resumed pumping heavy mud into the ruptured well after a pause to assess the effect of its `` top kill '' operation . The procedure is aimed at stemming the oil flow , from what some experts say is the country 's worst-ever spill . New estimates from a panel of US scientists said at least 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons -RRB- were leaking into the Gulf every day , far exceeding the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster . The leak was caused by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April , which also killed 11 workers .

If pressure and density sufficient , oil and gas flow stops But he admitted the government did not have the technology to deal with the damaged oil well nearly a mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- below the surface , meaning that Washington must rely on BP to plug the ruptured well . The president 's comments came as questions were increasingly being asked about whether he had been sufficiently engaged in handling the disaster , says the BBC 's Adam Brookes in Washington . In a shake-up of the offshore oil industry , Mr Obama suspended test drilling on 33 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico , as well as halting exploratory deepwater drilling for another six months . In addition , he canceled the sale of some offshore leases off the coasts of Alaska and Virginia . Correspondents say the move marks a shift in policy since March , when President Obama gave the go-ahead to widen the scope for offshore drilling in order to reduce dependency on oil imports . Hours before Mr Obama spoke , the head of the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , which oversees drilling operations , resigned . Elizabeth Birnbaum and the MMS have come under fire from lawmakers over lax oversight of drilling operations . The president blasted the `` scandalously close relationship '' between oil companies and regulators , and said officials granting exploration permits would no longer be responsible as well for ensuring safety . Also on Thursday , Mr Obama 's top spill response official - Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen - approved part of an ambitious plan to build barrier islands to stop oil from coming ashore in Louisiana . The oil leak has already soiled more than 110km -LRB- 70 miles -RRB- of Louisiana 's coastline , threatening fragile marshlands and putting the Louisiana fishing industry at risk . In the first official estimate of the size of the oil leak , US Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said government teams estimated the flow ranges from 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons or 1.9 million litres -RRB- to 25,000 barrels per day .

His trip to Grand Isle is designed to deal with that but its very brevity , less than two hours here , may undermine the intention . This is the first major crisis that has happened on Mr Obama 's watch and his handling of it has not increased his reputation for competence , leadership or , strangely , empathy . `` I give the people of this community and the entire gulf my word that we 're going to hold ourselves accountable to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to stop this catastrophe , to defend our natural resources , to repair the damage and to keep this region on its feet . '' Earlier on the tour , Mr Obama visited a beach guarded by a protective boom , and was seen stooping to inspect the sand and picking up a handful of tar balls . Thousands of barrels of oil have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico after a Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank last month , killing 11 employees . The thick crude oil has already permeated more than 110km -LRB- 70 miles -RRB- of Louisiana 's coastline , threatening fragile wetlands and putting the vital fishing industry at risk . Earlier , Mr Hayward has said that BP engineers had successfully completed a second phase of the `` top kill '' procedure - pumping in debris , known as a `` junk shot '' - which would next allow them to pump in more heavyweight mud . If the mud works in stopping the flow , BP can then pour cement to seal the well for good . New estimates from a panel of US scientists said at least 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons -RRB- were leaking into the gulf every day , making it the worst spill in US history . In a shake-up of the offshore oil industry , Mr Obama on Thursday suspended test drilling on 33 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico , as well as halting exploratory deepwater drilling for another six months . In addition , he canceled the sale of some offshore leases off the coasts of Alaska and Virginia . Correspondents say the move marks a shift in policy since March , when President Obama gave the go-ahead to widen the scope for offshore drilling in order to reduce dependency on oil imports .

So far there has been approximately 500,000 gallons of oil leaking out every day for over a month now .

This needs to change , if we are to continue drilling in deep waters for oil , we need to know we can shut down a blown vent within a matter of hours , this technological ability has not yet been developed to anything like a satisfactory degree .

Not funny is n't it ??? How the oil spill seems to have overshadowed the human death toll in the initial explosion . People not knowing what to do ... Piper Alpha all over again . already it seems , IT IS NOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE . I am amazed by the general ignorance of some of the posts here . Not as simple as that . This is about pressure . You need a pressure equal to or above the pressure coming from the well formation . This is why only a top kill or relief well will fix it . You ca n't just plug the well with some chewing gum . Oh and of course , those horrible nasty people at BP who wanted this to happen if you believe some of the drivel on here . This is how it works . The drilling of the well is contracted to a drilling company along with many other subcontractors . In this instance , Transocean -LRB- US company -RRB- , a drilling company along with Halliburton -LRB- A dick cheney company -RRB- etc. . They employ drillers who control the drilling and the well control . Above them they would have a tool pusher who is their senior superviser . Then you would have the ` company man ' who is a representative from BP and makes sure the well is being drilled to plan etc. . Above him you will probably an offshore installation manager or perhaps a rig superintendent employed by Transocean . Then you would probably have a barge capatain or similar . So now we can see there are many people in the chain of command on the rig so before you brand BP as the culprit maybe you need to look at the whole picture . Any one of these people are empowered when it comes to well control . But no , you wo n't want to believe any of that because you believe everything you read in the press . How dare anyone discredit these people who worked on the rig . They have a dangerous job to bring the fossil fuels YOU demand . Whatever happened was catrostrophic . Nobody allowed this to happen . There are decision making failures made in all parts of life . These people would never in a million years jeopardize an incident that could wrecks lives like this . Clearly there were failures . Does n't take a rocket scientist to figure that out . People who are going round saying ` it 's BP 's fault ' do n't know what they are talking about . It 's ok for the US to make up some kind of skewed logic to go and bomb iraq or afghanistan but woe betide anyone who cause any damage on US soil . Its us , the consumers , who are really to blame for all this . We want to drive grossly overpowered cars and SUV 's and yet we cry wolf when the by product of that demand causes environmental damage . Surely all those fumes that end up in the atmosphere from all those millions of cars choking the atmosphere will have a far more wider reaching effect than an oil spill in the gulf ? This issue is far bigger than it appears and should n't be a money making exercise for unscrupulous lawyers seeking to punish anyone who has a whiff of a connection with this incident . There are people who have a legitimate right to feel angry . The people who have lost loved ones , employees on the rig , and people who have lost their livelihoods . These people are heroes because they are having to go through times that are far tougher than we could ever imagine . So spare a thought and before you make crass and pointless comments , take some time to understand what is really going and show respect for the people who have truly been affected by this .

And , while I am not now a full time Gulf area resident , I have recently been down there to see for myself . It does not seem like enough . It is n't enough . I could say the same thing about both the Obama administration and the corporate culture that many here have said . But it deflects from the consequences of this gusher , that , quite frankly , has already changed the area . The Gulf region will be contaminated far beyond my own life span . In a very general sense , my reaction has been very emotional . I 've been scared , sad , frustrated and angry . The impact is devastating . But my anger has been that BP has been playing at `` fixing '' this problem . I think they should destroy the well and cut their losses instead of playing with top hats and domes and straws . From my perspective , it is really difficult NOT to see this as corporate greed . But if we are talking a financial bottom line , I would think that at the cost of this `` clean up '' , destroying the well would actually be a bit cheaper -- in the long run . And , if they have to have that oil , drill again , close by , BUT THE NEXT TIME TAKING PROPER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS . I 'm not sure what the rest of the world is hearing about this situation . But this is what I 've heard and what has left an impression in my mind . BP\\/Transocean cut corners on safety measures , to what amounts to $ 500,000 for a safety component on the well head . That 's why the methane was not sealed and the methane caused the explosion that resulted in 11 dead people and the gusher . Because the well head is a mile down in the water , actual humans can not get to it . It 's too deep . There is also the fact that BP has a history , at least in the US , of failing to have proper safety measures in place -- on rigs and at oil plants . This accident comes right after BP was fined the largest ever fine for safety violations for a follow up at a refinery in Texas that had previously had an event during which 15 people died . So , I know for myself that I think BP has not learned from previous accidents -LRB- this Texas accident was within the last few years , so it 's recent -RRB- . To me , this seems as though BP thinks it 's easier and better financially to continue to payout these hefty fines than to actually ensure safety and protect people and the environment . That being said , I also blame the US government . This is just one more example of my government not watching out for its citizens ' interests but instead championing corporate interests . We saw it in the banking industry . These are the things that happen when government is not in the business of regulation . Capitalism , in the current US form , is idiotic . It has been proven over and over in industry after industry that business will NOT regulate itself . So , yes , I 'm sick that this is just one more thing down the line where the US government has failed to protect me from , via more stringent regulation and enforcement of regulations already on the books -- and for having sold my interests away to an oil rig in the Gulf . But blame hardly satisfies me . I know it 's important to know who to blame for what in order to remedy the process , the institution , etc. . But the gushing continues . We ca n't run away from it . It 's knocking ... It 's terrifying . I want BP to actually do something . Their efforts have been relatively minor in comparison to the problem . Bring in the entire fleet , stop poisoning with chemicals , and blow the well head up and stop the gushing once and for all .

BP raked in the profits and its top eschelon got big bonuses but it now appears that very little or no planning and no money went into designing and testing equipment for a worst case scenario such as this one . BP played the odds that nothing would ever happen and it lost . The ad hoc nature of BP 's attempts clearly to stop the oil leak shows that BP never had any viable emergency plans to put into action . Moreover big money corrupts absolutely and it seems that BP had a cozy relationship with the government agencies whose job it was to oversee and regulate offshore drilling . The Bush administration shredded almost all drilling regulations and castrated the minerals and mining regulatory agency from imposing whatever regulations remained on oil companies . Even Sarah Palin shouted `` Drill Baby Drill ! '' in a typically dumb Republican fashion . It 's an example of how big corporations influence government and when adversity strikes they try to circumvent their responsibility by passsing the blame onto someone else as occurred by company execs in testiomonials before Congress . As the world 's technology grows and becomes more complex and intertwined , the solutions to the problems caused by this technology will have to become more complex . Deep-sea oil rigs are complex . A well-blowout at 1 mile deep has no precedent ; therefore no easy solutions . Wind-powered turbines wo n't have these problems but will have their own unique ones .

I recall the Torrie cannon in the south of england cleared up the surface mess but i bet you dare ` nt look to low in the sea bed to find out the truth of the matter i recall people stating they can still smell the thick goo even today . nd this leakage is on a grander scale so BP will be lucky if they stay in business after the solicitors have had their say in the matter .

I find it obscene that Obama publically condemns the operator and has stayed dumb about the wilful misconduct of the American contractors involved . My respect for the American President in the face of this unmitigated disaster has evaporated . God help the world from Americans . We had the Piper Alpha disaster , and our Government did not go on the offensive , but ensured that lessons were learned and regulations amended to minimize the risk of repeating the negligence which resulted in the disaster .

It would not have had to employ booms or dispersants , and it could have ignored the health effects on people and the damage done to fishing . It might have eventually been taken to court and could have been fined a few million dollars , but it would probably have appealed and delayed a court decision for a decade or more . `` Big Oil is usually a poor country 's most powerful industry , and is generally allowed to act like a parallel government .

BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said the firm was now shifting to a new strategy to stop the spill . In the failed procedure - known as `` top kill '' - the firm had been blasting waste material and heavy mud into a ruptured well . US President Barack Obama said the continued flow of oil was `` as enraging as it is heartbreaking '' . The worst oil spill in US history began when a drilling rig exploded and sank last month , killing 11 people . The thick crude has already permeated more than 70 miles -LRB- 110km -RRB- of Louisiana 's coastline , threatening fragile wetlands and putting the vital fishing industry at risk . Mr Suttles said BP had determined that the `` top kill '' method - which had been going on since Wednesday - had failed after studying the results for three days . `` We have not been able to stop the flow , '' he told reporters on Saturday . `` This scares everybody , the fact that we ca n't make this well stop flowing , the fact that we have n't suceeded so far , '' he said . The company says it pumped 30,000 barrels of mud into the well , in three attempts , at rates of up to 80 barrels a minute , but it had not worked . Oil booms - partly successful Dispersant used - scientists warn it may kill marine life Huge dome placed over leak - became blocked by ice crystals Mile-long tube - fails to suck up large amount of oil `` Top-kill '' method to pump heavy mud - abandoned It is the latest procedure to have failed since attempts to plug the leak began , with BP having spent more than $ 940 million -LRB- # 645 million -RRB- so far . An initial plan to place a 125-tonne dome over the leak failed when it became blocked with ice crystals . A mile-long tube designed to capture some of the gushing oil was also unsuccessful . The next option after the failure of `` top kill '' is called the lower-marine-riser-package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- cap containment system . It involves an underwater robot using a saw to hack off the leaking pipe and place a cap over it . The LMRP cap is already on site and the operation is expected to last four days . BP says it can not guarantee that the new method - which has not been carried out at depths of 5,000 feet before - will be successful . At least 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons -RRB- are leaking into the Gulf every day . The BBC 's Andy Gallacher says the failure is another blow for the region . Our correspondent says that people in Louisiana are growing increasingly impatient and angry . Some fishermen have nailed up signs , with one reading `` BP , you ruined our futures and our heritage '' , our correspondent adds . `` Everybody 's starting to realize this summer 's lost . And our whole lifestyle might be lost , '' Michael Ballay , the manager of Cypress Cove Marina , told Associated Press . On Friday , US President Barack Obama toured oil-hit areas , saying the US would `` do whatever it takes '' to help those affected . He said he would triple the manpower to contain and clean up the spill . A total of 20,000 people have already been deployed . Mr Obama said he would take responsibility for `` solving this crisis '' , though he said BP would be held financially accountable for the `` enormous damage '' .

BP is to try a new tactic after its latest failure to halt the leak , but says there is no guarantee of success .

Eleven rig workers died when the Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank nearly six weeks ago . Ms Browner , talking on NBC 's Meet The Press , said : `` More oil is leaking in the Gulf of Mexico than at any other time in our history . It means there is more oil than the Exxon Valdez -LRB- in Alaska in 1989 -RRB- . '' Carol Browner on ` the biggest eco-disaster ever ' , on NBC 's Meet the Press She said she hoped the latest plan would work but admitted it would be a temporary measure and that a relief well currently being drilled might turn out to be the permanent solution . However , that will not be ready for at least two months . Ms Browner said BP had been told to drill another relief well in case the first did not work . In the meantime , BP is setting up its Lower Marine Riser Package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- to stem the flow . It will use undersea robots to slice through the damaged pipe to make a clean cut that can be connected to another pipe , capturing the leaking oil . The plan will take four days to set up . However , BP said the operation had never been carried out at a depth of 5,000 ft and `` the successful deployment of the containment system can not be assured '' .

The sell-offs came as the firm 's so-called `` top kill '' bid failed to plug the massive spill from its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico . BP said later that it hoped to contain the spill `` within 24 hours '' by sealing the fractured pipe with a cap . Meanwhile , the US government said it would launch criminal and civil proceedings against BP . An operation to cap the leak was launched on Tuesday using underwater robots . BP 's chief operating officer Doug Suttles said that `` if everything goes well '' , the capping process could contain the spill within a day . However , he warned that success was not guaranteed and asked people to `` remember this is being done in 5,000 feet of water , and very small issues take a long time to fix '' . And there remains fears the leak will now go on for at least another two months , until relief wells can be drilled . The earlier top kill method that failed involved pumping mud into the well . BP said that the total bill for the clean-up already stood at $ 990m -LRB- # 684m -RRB- . The shares sell-off was BP 's biggest one-day shares fall for 18 years , and wiped # 12bn off its stock market value .

BBC Business editor Robert Peston said it was `` certainly not ludicrous to assume that the final cost for BP of this mess could wipe out at least an entire year 's profit '' . Announcing the criminal and civil investigations into the oil spill , US Attorney General Eric Holder said : `` We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who has violated the law . `` We will not rest until justice is done . '' US President Barack Obama had earlier called the incident the worst oil spillage disaster in US history . He also said his administration would prosecute over the oil spill if laws have been broken , and promised to change the law if necessary to prevent another such disaster . The nearly $ 1bn clean-up cost to date includes $ 40m in economic injury claims , as well as grants to the authorities in the US states located in the Gulf area . However , the latest fall in BP 's shares suggests that markets now expect the ultimate cost to the company from the oil spill to be much more severe than this . BP 's share price closed on Friday at # 4.95 , but fell to # 4.12 after the markets reopened on Tuesday - after a Monday bank holiday - before closing at # 4.30 . BP 's legal liability in the US is currently limited by law to a mere $ 75m , although this is expected to be increased to $ 10bn .

He added that BP owns only 65 % of the oil well , meaning its legal liability will be limited to just $ 6.5 bn - although it could go higher if BP were found guilty of gross negligence or a criminal act . `` The markets seem to assume that BP will have to withdraw from America , '' he added , noting that there was talk among government lawyers about barring the oil company from US government contracts . BP is also the biggest participant in deep sea drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , and therefore is likely to be hardest hit by the moratorium on this activity announced by President Barack Obama . The sharp fall in BP 's share price is bad news for UK pension funds , which are major shareholders in the firm . The oil company has claimed that it pays # 1 in every # 7 of dividends that the pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies . Although the price change does not directly affect BP 's ability to pay dividends , it does indicate that markets are anticipating a significant cut . Some oil analysts have also speculated that if BP 's share price continues to fall , the company may find that it becomes an affordable takeover target for some of its global rivals . BP now hopes to cap the leak by using undersea robots to slice through the damaged pipe to make a clean cut that can be connected to another pipe , capturing the leaking oil . However , this strategy may not stop the oil spill completely . That will only happen once BP has finished drilling two new relief wells - something that is not expected to be ready before August . The White House said the president had been informed that the flow rate could increase by as much as 20 % until the containment device was applied over the leak . University of Alabama engineering professor Philip W Johnson told Associated Press news agency that although he was hopeful the plan would succeed , if the new cap could not be placed on the fresh cut , `` things will get much worse '' . The system is similar to a previous containment dome plan that failed . Meanwhile , the oil giant said it was stepping up its containment strategy . It said that the total length of the boom - used to collect oil floating on the sea surface - would be almost doubled to 3.7 million ft. . BP also now plans to use hoses and other equipment deployed in the failed `` top kill '' strategy to siphon off more of the leaking oil . `` BP 's priority is to keep as much oil as we can from causing additional harm to the Gulf , the shoreline and the people of the region , '' said BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward on Monday . `` This planned multi-step containment strategy is our best option for achieving this as we work hard towards completing the relief wells that will kill this well completely .

Perhaps more damagingly , the debacle is doing considerable harm to the value of its brand in the US - with what looks like every US citizen , from President Obama down , equating BP with the sullying of one of America 's most cherished coastlines . The talk among BP oil executives is that the company 's reputation in the US may have been so tarnished that the board will conclude that an orderly withdrawal from America - with the sale of its massive US assets - may be necessary -LRB- it 's widely thought , for example , that Chevron would be an enthusiastic buyer of those assets -RRB- . Were that exit to occur , it would represent one of the great corporate humiliations of all time , a reversal of those mega-bids of Amoco and Arco by BP - when under the sway of Lord Browne - which transformed a division-two British player into one of the global giants only a decade or so ago . And what of Lord Browne 's successor as chief exec , Tony Hayward ? It would be challenging to identify any specific decision or lapse by him as the cause of what is now seen as the worst oil spill in US history . But some argue that BP was slow in recognizing the gravity of the debacle after the explosion in April . And then there 's the boringly obvious point that angry shareholders , angry Gulf coast fisherman and angry US citizens have a very human need to blame someone - and if not the BP boss , then who ?

The impact of Katrina on Louisiana devastated the same area and the US government response was poor ; no different in affecting livelihoods . Inevitably accidents like this are due to a series of small errors which individually are not dangerous but together cause a catastrophe . Until a full investigation is completed the attribution of blame can not be decided . BP employed TransOcean and other service companies to complete work on its behalf .

That is the risk of working on the margins in deep water . There are no instant solutions , the US government should know this given its long history with the oil industry . Remember the US regulatory authorities approved the drilling of the well knowing the risks . Hayward as CEO is in a difficult position .

I am not sure we will ever know for sure , maybe when the well is plugged and if they raise the BOP to find out exactly why it failed to perform , then maybe we will have some answers , Transocean and Haliburton will be quite content to sit on the sidelines and let BP take the heat on this , but privately I am sure they will be very worried that the focus could significantly shift from BP to them .

As I 've said elsewhere , my impression is that BP have been remarkable amongst large organizations in being open and accepting its responsibilities . Do you remember a government ever accepting responsibility when things go badly ? BP have probably made the biggest effort of all the oil companies over the years to develop international standards for offshore activities .

They 'd have made plenty of long-term profit if they 'd stuck to best practice in drilling such as using the mandatory emergency valves required by the Latin Americans , not used contractors -LRB- so ca n't be too closely controlled -RRB- and treated their employees with respect .

What are we looking at ? A thousand times higher costs than were saved , and environmental damage that should never have occurred - as a minimum ? Where does the New coalition government stand on BP ? They have been very quiet considering all the noise Obama is making . This governement has an awful lot to lose if BP are forced into a downward spiral by the US authorities . The loss of revenue from corporation tax will have a massive impact on the current budget deficit and not to mention the loss of dividends to all the pension funds . They should be giving their support to BP by sending troops out to help with the clean up and show that the British are behind British Petroleum . Afterall the banks had a helping hand after the mess they got themselves into . Before the US bans BP from their shores they should think about the consequences . BP could sell the rights to China to get the best price ! The US will also try to ban the Chinese from exploiting these fields but even so , by just holding onto these assets the Chinese will have the US by the balls ! Is that what a US government really wants ? Time for a little perspective . First regarding BP - aside from the US government -LRB- who were MIA throughout -RRB- , BP are at the top of the food chain , they will take the hit and flak , and so they should . They will certainly pay more than anyone else . But they wo n't be alone . Haliburton are up to their eyes in this , as are the BOP manufacturers and the rig subcontractors . Of course it is sad to see a British company stuck squarely in the the middle of such an almighty natural disaster , such a catastrophe . But then its sad to see an environmental catastrophe on this scale anywhere , at any time , caused by anyone . The fall out wo n't simply be picked up by BP if for example deep sea drilling is permanently scrapped . This will effect any number of US companies not to mention the price of fuel at the pump and air travel costs . It might save more of our environment . Perspective is everything here . We all use oil , ca n't get enough of the stuff . We do n't like paying for it . The cost isnt just financial - its also environmental and always has been . As a non-US citizen it is utterly terrible what is happening to local communities there , I hope they are compensated , I hope they do not suffer too much as a result of this . But if they drive to a protest in an HUV then they need to see that in so doing those people are buying the drugs BP , Haliburton and others are peddling . We each need a little humility here sufficient to say I was n't involved in this specfic accident , but in buying the product im partly responsible . I do n't hear that in the rhetoric coming out of the US and from Obama - its far more ` the blame game ' which is unfortunately very predictable . BP employs a lot of US people and its not like Rosneft ! To be concerned about damage to the environment is great , but damage to the environment is not just that which we can see , it isnt just felt by those in the communities bordering the oil spill . You can obviously now see the destruction and are witnessing it first hand -LRB- as well as the impact -RRB- , and it is terrible that oil now prevents your communities from functioning properly . However the electricity you use , the output from your car , the air miles you accumulate all contribute to rising sea levels and climate change in the broader context which in turn impacts communities like yours all around the world . America can not now , at the eleventh hour , turn around and take the moral high ground on the environment , it is simply laughable . Where were you at Kyoto ? Why is your petrol so cheap ? Why are your cars so inefficient ? Why are they so big ?! Why are you not prepared to consider green alternatives ? Ask yourself - do you personally , at your home , recycle ? We must all face the painful truth that BP is the tip of the pyramid , and we 're all directly underneath them , we 're all partly responsible . Any amount of fine wo n't alter that - its all just politics and window dressing .

Every problem can be dealt with by carrying out a `` risk assessment '' . If you raise an issue and do not wear a pair of cowboy boots and a Stetson it 's very likely to be ignored . There are a lot of good speakers in the new BP but few good listeners . If BP survives this disaster then they need to get back to basics of good solid engineering and operating . Well let 's look at the facts . BP leases a rig from Transocean and a couple of weeks later a component fails a mile deep . The component was being managed by Haliburton at the time of failure . BP puts its hand up to take responsibility for stopping the leak and the clean-up while Transocean and Haliburton sit on their hands hoping not to be noticed . But taking responsibility is not the same as being guilty . So who is to blame ? The only one with enough financial clout is BP so Obama goes after them . But is there another agenda here ? And is Obama being wise or just electioneering for the mid-terms ? After all it was only recently that he was encouraging oil exploration offshore . And a foreign-owned company is a good target . BP is one of the biggest operators in the US and at one point owned almost 50 % of the US oil reserves . That was because they explored the Alaska field , a feat of technical engineering that others could n't or would n't try . And their experience in deep ocean drilling is second to none , forged in the hostile North Sea . They have had a few accidents yes and that may be because of some poor practices but they also find oil where no-one else has . So is this really an attempt to reign back not only sourcing oil from foreign parts but any foreign ownership of US reserves ? The company that in essence promoted and profited from the Iraq war via its friends in government ? They managed to manipulate one rather willing president into doing something rather stupid . It 's a great pity that his successor has fallen for the same trick . I did think better of Obama but now I am not so sure . He is either just as devious as the last lot or a mug being manipulated to the tune of the US oil industry . Only time will tell and probably not for a long time . People have not forgotten Bhopal and Union Carbide 's woeful neglect . So far 11 people have died and there is economic damage that may tak 5-10 years to repair . In Bhopal 2,500 people died , there has been no justice for them and there are still deformities and other problems . Rattling BP is likely to play very well for them in other markets when people remember this . The word hypocracy springs to mind and the US would be well advised to just get on helping with the leak and the clean up and not feeding the fees of already fat lawyers .

At state government level a huge effort is taking place , at containing the spill and protecting the coastline . At Federal level I suspect that the too many agencies are vying with each other and end up tripping over each other accomplishing not a lot . It is astounding that technology developed in the Persian Gulf has not been deployed : supertakers modified to scoop up sea water polluted with oil . The process then separates oil from water etc. . Instead they are making do with stone age oil booms which will definetely not cope as we enter the hurricane season . The syndrome which prevents the US authorities using this technology has the acronym NIH -LRB- Not Invented Here -RRB- . The current Gulf spill is nowhere near the worst ever and barely makes the top 40 . Last month in the Nigerian delta the SIXTEENTH worst ever oil spill took place . Exxon Mobil is the oil company and the World bank provided the finance . Last year there were 300 separate oil spill incidents in the Nigerian delta . I guess Obama 's concern for Africa is limited to the birthplace of his Kenyan uncle . No compensation for poor black Nigerians then ! The compensation aspect of the Gulf will rebound on Obama and the USa big time . There are proven large oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico waiting to be exploited . The new downside is that prudent risk management will chase many investors away , so pushing up the price of gasoline for US consumers . The US media sets store on BP 's Britishness , yet their analysis merely matches the Federal government 's ineffectual handwringing . BP 's main operations are predominantly outside the UK -LRB- most of it 's North Sea rigs\\/fields are run and owned by smaller oil companies -RRB- , in the Americas and South Asia . Google oil spills and the incidents are so common it is amazing that the outcry is not greater . The media have become blase about it now , and the spill only makes the headlines if it is big and in your backyard . We in the UK are guilty as well ; remember the Torrey Canyon in SW England ? The future is tricky for the industry as basically the easy oil fields have been exploited : the others are more difficult to access so pollution risks and financial costs are higher .

The US needs the -LRB- obviously proven -RRB- fields in the Gulf of Mexico , who do they think is going to get it out for them now ? Do they think with the fallout hitting BP that any other oil company is going to step forwards readily ?? As for the Americans ' attitude towards BP ... what hypocrites ! They bemoan the fact that there 's a major spill on their doorstep , yet if Deepwater Horizon was pumping this out of the ground would be celebrating cheaper oil . Let 's not lose track of the fact that this is a tragedy both environmentally & the loss of life that has occurred , but both the American people & their President 's hypocrisy is beyond belief . The British people need to think twice about entering into any arrangements with the USA in the future , whether it be trade or military `` co-operation '' otherwise we 'll end up holding the -LRB- guess the expletive -RRB- end of the stick . Robert , you mention ` talk among BP oil executives ... ' etc. . Any BP withdrawal from America would be , to say the least , surprising and at worst ` bizarre ' by such an international company with shared , as well as competitive links , to American companies ? However , what might be expected , is that BP . , operating under American leases in such deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , may reconsider their sub-contractor companies in the future ?

Tell me , have YOU ever blamed someone when you were scared ? As for these people deserving what happened - what did they ever do to you ? The people of the Gulf Coast are warm , friendly , hospitable `` folks '' . If you showed up on their doorstep in need of help , they would invite you into their home , offer you something to drink , help any way the could and give you a hug when you leave .

How much time have you spent in the U.S. ? Do you really have a clue who the regular people are ? Jesus asked that he who is without sin cast the first stone . Are YOU without sin ? Think you can dredge up a little compassion for these poor people and the environment ? This is without doubt BP 's fault . It is BP 's safeguards and procedures which allowed this to happen along with sloppy work from the contractors .

I have seen BP work all over the world and I do n't recognize what I am seeing here , someone 's got a liking for cowboy hats and it 's spread . This will not end until the relief wells kick in and allows the well to be secured . This looks like it could end Obama 's chance of extending his presidency and rightly so from his dumb posturing to take control of the situation . Just what good does he believe he thinks he is doing at the present ? Go back over every previous administration and you will find the reason this was allowed to happen .

The prediction this year for the Atlantic is for an `` active to extremely active '' hurricane season , which officially began on 1 June . According to the US 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , there is a 70 % chance of eight to 14 hurricanes , of which between three and seven could be major hurricanes with winds of more than 111mph -LRB- 179km\\/h -RRB- . I 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant '' End Quote Prof Ed Overton Environmental scientist Apart from the possibility of damage and loss of life unrelated to the oil spill , there is a very obvious downside to hurricanes passing near the source of the oil spill . A hurricane would clearly disrupt the efforts to stop the leak , although BP has a plan to install a device in order to quickly disconnect and reconnect the link down to the spill site in high winds . On shore , tasks like the laying of boom and rescue of wildlife would become more problematic . But what would happen to the oil that is already out there floating in the sea ? High winds and heavy seas would mix the oil and water and help the process of biodegradation , NOAA believes . Prof Ed Overton , an environmental studies expert at Louisiana State University -LRB- LSU -RRB- , agrees with this view . Operations at the site of the leaking well would be disrupted by a hurricane `` Concentrated oil in a very small area is very bad . But if you spread it out nature can handle that . Bacteria can degrade the oil . I 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant . '' But there is another downside . A hurricane has the potential to take oil to places it would not otherwise reach . It all depends on the path of the storm . `` A hurricane passing to the west of the oil slick could drive oil to the coast , '' the NOAA says . `` A hurricane passing to the east of the slick could drive the oil away from the coast . '' This is because hurricanes rotate anti-clockwise . To date , the weather conditions have been relatively placid out in the Gulf of Mexico . `` So far the water has been very slowly moving , almost stagnant , '' says Prof Chuanmin Hu , an optical oceanographer from the University of South Florida . PRO : Storm could disperse oil PRO : Hurricane east of slick area could in theory send oil further out to sea CON : Hurricane could cause loss of life and damage to property CON : New oil spills could be caused CON : Storm surge could take oil far inland CON : Operations at spill site and on shore disrupted But hurricanes cause storm surges . Such a surge of water has the potential not only to affect the behavior of oil far out in the Gulf , but also to cause grim consequences when it reaches the shore . `` It is potentially not a pretty picture , '' says Prof Nan Walker , an oceanographer at the School of the Coast and Environment at LSU . `` A real concern is that because Louisiana is so low-lying , even a category one storm can raise the water level eight or 10 feet . `` There is potential for oil to go fairly far inland , penetrating the marshes even deeper . It makes the problem potentially a lot worse . '' The sand berms , or barriers , that have been planned in Louisiana may not stop even a relatively small storm surge . `` You have to have a very high berm to stop a 10ft storm surge , '' says Prof Walker . `` Another issue is that the waves are enormous during a hurricane . '' She recalls that Hurricane Ivan , a category four storm , created waves of 80ft -LRB- 23.4 m -RRB- out at sea . End Quote Prof Nan Walker Oceanographer If there is any oil suspended underwater , such high waves would bring it to the surface - but it is likely then to be diluted , she says . NOAA addresses this point , suggesting that the oil underneath the surface , anywhere away from the leak site , is only being measured in parts per million and will be further dispersed by a hurricane . One thing NOAA 's experts seem clear about is that the oil leak will not have a significant effect on the formation of the hurricanes themselves . The track of hurricanes is very hard to predict . A pressure system called the Bermuda High can alter their path , notes Prof Walker . If this high pressure area is in the north , the hurricanes can be dragged up the east coast of the US . If the high pressure area expands to the south or the south-west , storms can be pulled to the west , hitting Mexico and the northern Gulf coast . As well as their path , their forward motion , intensity and wind speed are all very difficult to predict , NOAA notes . And previous experience of the interaction of oil spills and hurricanes has usually been based on slicks resulting from damage caused by the winds themselves . No-one can be sure what is going to happen . `` Hurricanes are the spin ball , '' says Prof Walker . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

But shares later fully recovered , closing just a quarter of a penny down , as markets rallied in the afternoon . Investors remain concerned over the impact that further litigation could have on the British oil giant 's finances and reputation . There are also fears that shareholders could see their dividend cut . The dividend paid to shareholders currently costs BP # 7bn a year , and accounts for about # 1 in every # 6 in dividends earned by institutional shareholders in London . The recover in BP 's shares came also came despite its latest attempt to stem the leak hitting problems . Engineers had been attempting to cut off the fractured pipe before sealing it with a cap , but the saw got stuck , and the firm is now attempting to release it . However , despite recouping its losses during the day , BP has still massively underperformed the market in recent weeks thanks to the oil spill . Since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , BP 's share price has fallen over 34 % , including a huge 13 % fall on Tuesday . BP is a major component of the FTSE 100 index - it currently comprise 6.1 % of the value of basket of shares that make up the index . Since the oil leak began , BP 's poor performance has dragged the entire index down a further 2.1 % , or 123 points , lower than it would otherwise be . BP estimates that the disaster has so far cost the company approximately $ 990m -LRB- # 674m -RRB- in clean-up costs , but has refused to speculate on future expenses . `` The situation is just so uncertain , '' Robert Talbut , chief investments officer at BP shareholder Royal London Asset Management , told the BBC . `` We do n't know when the oil leak is going to be plugged and we do n't know what the financial implications are going to be - that 's what is wearing on the share price at the moment . '' Investors say the cost of tackling the spill could rise to as much as # 5bn . But of greater concern is the potential costs of legal action being launched against the company , and the fallout of the criminal inquiry announced by the US Attorney General , Eric Holder , on Tuesday . BP boss Tony Hayward still has the backing of shareholders Currently the market is expecting huge litigation costs of between # 20bn and # 50bn . Mr Holder said those involved in the spill would be `` closely examined '' . `` If we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be extremely forceful in our response , '' he said . In an interview with Fox News , BP 's chief operating officer Doug Suttles said he had `` no idea '' if BP had broken any laws in relation to its drilling operations . Meanwhile authorities in Louisiana , the state worst hit by the oil leak , are expected to launch legal action on behalf of victims . If it were be proven that BP had cut corners ... it 's going to be very difficult for any chief executive to remain '' End Quote Robert Talbut Chief investments officer at Royal London Asset Management BP said it had so-far paid out more than $ 40m to 15,000 individual claimants who have lost out financially because of the oil slick . Institutional investors are expected to question BP chief executive Tony Hayward in a conference call later this week , and further face-to-face meetings between major shareholders and Mr Hayward are also planned . The security of the BP dividend is likely to be high on the agenda , but Mr Hayward is believed to have the backing of shareholders , and his position at the head of the company is not believed to be under question . However , Royal London 's Robert Talbut warned that this could change depending on the outcome of legal action . `` If it were be proven that BP had cut corners , that they had not fulfilled their -LRB- legal -RRB- obligations - I think it 's going to be very difficult for any chief executive to remain , '' he said . Since mid April , BP 's share price has fallen by more than 35 % , accounting for more than a quarter of the 11 % fall in the FTSE 100 over the same time . Other markets have also been affected by the fallout from the oil disaster . In Tokyo , Japanese investment company Mitsui & Co , which owns 10 % of the affected oil well , saw its share price fall 8 % on Wednesday . US oil company Anadarko , the third partner in the Deepwater Horizon rig , saw its share price plummet 20 % on Tuesday , but recovered some 3 % in early New York trading on Wednesday . Analysts expect its costs related to the disaster to total around $ 2bn .

BP chief Tony Hayward hailed it as an `` important milestone '' and said BP could know within the next 12 to 24 hours if the capping effort would succeed . For now , undersea robots are preparing the well-head to receive the cap . President Barack Obama is to visit the gulf on Friday , his third trip there since the leak began six weeks ago . The White House has been under increasing pressure to show the administration is in control of the response and clean-up efforts . The federal government will send a $ 69m -LRB- # 47.1 m -RRB- bill to BP Plc on Thursday for expenditure incurred from its response to the spill , the White House said . Meanwhile , a detailed computer modelling study indicated that oil from the spill might extend along thousands of miles of the Atlantic coast and open ocean as early as this summer . The National Center for Atmospheric Research said once oil entered the `` Loop Current '' , part of the Gulf Stream which sweeps around the Florida panhandle , it would be only weeks before it reached Florida 's Atlantic shores . The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed . The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section . First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely-operated shear . This was completed at 1930 CDT on 1 June -LRB- 0030 GMT 2 June -RRB- . The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP . The blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB- ROV -RRB- . After removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface . Latest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is now being captured . BACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Speaking in Houston , Mr Hayward described the pipe-cutting procedure as `` simply the beginning '' . BP used giant shears manipulated by undersea robots to snip off the end of the pipe , after a diamond-edged saw failed to do the job . The challenge is now to place a containment cap securely over the cut and stop the oil flow . The company hopes to collect the oil on a surface ship above the well . `` Our task is to contain the oil , ultimately to eliminate the leaking well , and most importantly , to clean up all of the oil , defend the shoreline and restore the shoreline where oil does come ashore such that we return it to its original state , '' Mr Hayward said . BP estimates that the disaster has so far cost the company about $ 990m in clean-up costs . Two Democratic senators have written to Mr Hayward urging him to suspend payments to shareholders worth $ 10bn until all costs of the clean-up and compensation are paid out . On Wednesday , BP said it would pay for the construction of six sand barriers off the coast of the US state of Louisiana . The sand barrier project will push BP 's bill to about $ 1.4 bn . BP share prices have continued to plummet in trading on the London Stock Exchange , amid news the US justice department has opened several civil and criminal inquiries into the Gulf spill .

The oil began leaking into the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , leased to BP , exploded , killing 11 workers . BP is drilling two relief wells to permanently stop the leak but they are not expected to be completed until August .

The downturn began on Tuesday , after BP 's `` top kill '' plan failed to block a massive leak in the Gulf of Mexico by pumping mud into the well . But BP 's bonds continued to fall even as its shares recovered on Wednesday . Meanwhile , rating agencies Moody 's and Fitch both cut the firm 's credit rating on Thursday , and threaten further downgrades . Moody 's and Fitch each cut BP 's rating by a modest one notch , from Aa1 to Aa2 , and from AA + to AA , respectively . However , they also both put the company on review for possible further downgrades , as they wait to see how the situation in the Gulf of Mexico pans out . Some investors are restricted from owning lower grade bonds , and if BP suffers further cuts in its ratings , this could force those investors to sell their holdings . BP said later on Thursday that it had cut a ruptured pipe from the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , a key step in the latest effort to cap the well . Even after the downgrades , both agencies still give BP one of their highest investment grade credit ratings , as does Standard & Poor 's , which rates BP at AA . `` AA is still a very strong rating , '' said BP spokesman Mark Salt . `` BP does not have a specific ratings target . '' Yet bond markets are now pricing BP 's debts at levels comparable with much riskier `` junk '' rated companies . The oil company 's main five-year dollar bond was trading on Thursday at a yield of 5.5 % - some 3.25 % more expensive than the interest rate that the US government would have to borrow at . Yet before the weekend , the same BP bond was trading at a yield of 3.5 % , meaning its borrowing cost has jumped by 2 % as a result of the failure to plug the oil leak . One City analyst told the BBC that the bond markets ' fears made no sense , because BP has so little debt . BP owes # 14bn in total debts , whereas stock markets currently value the company at # 84bn . BP head Tony Hayward will hold a crucial call with investors on Friday Meanwhile , investors in BP 's shares - including most UK pension funds - fear that the company may now cut its dividend . US senators have been calling on the firm to do just that , saying the money should be reserved by BP to cover the oil clean-up costs . Investors will be looking to a conference call on Friday afternoon with the company 's management expected to reassure them that they will maintain the dividend . BP 's current dividend is due to be paid on 22 June , and its next dividend to be announced on 27 July . Fitch said further downgrades could follow , if cleaning up the Deepwater Horizon leak , and political fallout in the US , were more costly than expected . Among the many ongoing risks cited by the rating agency were : the current plan to cut the leaking pipeline may actually permanently increase the rate of leakage the relief well being drilled by BP may fail to completely stop the leak quickly total clean-up costs may exceed Fitch 's worst-case expectations of $ 5bn a year the US may require BP to pay for more than just the clean-up -LRB- such as benefits for those made unemployed by the oil slick , such as fishermen -RRB- the impact of potential criminal charges BP may have to permanently halt drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico .

Also , send us your ideas using the text form at the bottom If you have an images of your idea e-mail : yourpics@bbc.co.uk, subject SPILL IDEAS Int MMS : +447725100100 The public are also doing their part . By 2 June , BP had received 31,600 suggestions from members of the public on how to plug the well , or deal with the oil slicks already in the sea . The company 's helpline , which has 80 telephone operators , deals with interested citizens . Of the 31,600 ideas , 8,000 have been submitted on paper . BP then puts the plans through a four-stage process . The first is a primary evaluation to weed out ideas that have already been considered or are just not possible . The second stage is classification into categories such as `` dispersants '' or `` mechanical '' . The third stage is a more detailed technical review and the fourth stage is field testing . There are 235 ideas currently in stage three and four , says BP . Of those , just 10 % are about how to plug the well . Some might ridicule the idea that interested amateurs might be able to solve a problem that is foxing a giant company with immense resources at its fingertips . John Harrison should have won the Longitude Prize But the notion has a long pedigree . One of the most famous examples of attempting to tap the public brain came in the Longitude Prize , established in the UK by Parliament in 1714 . For a seafaring nation , the ability to accurately measure longitude was a massive challenge . The act of Parliament offered # 20,000 to the person who could do it , and the clockmaker John Harrison established the principles for the marine chronometers that revolutionised navigation . Another prize was offered in late 18th Century France for the creation of soda crystals from sea salt . Harrison was met with scepticism and never received the full prize , while the French winner Nicholas Leblanc was denied his cash because of the revolution . The term `` crowdsourcing '' , coined by journalist Jeff Howe , author of Crowdsourcing : Why the Power of the Crowd Is Driving the Future of Business , is now often used to describe this phenomenon . Howe says that it is sometimes the case that problems that have proved insoluble to hand-picked experts can be solved when placed before a wider , but less expert , audience . I 'm looking at it from the point of view of doing home maintenance - if this happened in someone 's house how would I fix it ? '' End Quote Barry Redd Would-be solver '' -LRB- Crowdsourcing -RRB- is an acknowledgment that 99 times out of a 100 the best person to solve a problem is an expert . If it 's a chemistry problem , you want a chemist . `` But one time out of a hundred the problem seems intractable . Crowdsourcing has revealed - in those intractable cases - you need someone who is not trained . All the steps the experts have thought to do have n't worked . You need the unexpected . '' That might be why BP is using some of its resources to test these suggestions from the public . They wo n't reveal any of the detail of the submissions they have had , but look at some public forums on the web - not run by BP - and you can get a flavor of the sort of ideas that might be arriving . Barry Redd , from Louisburg , North Carolina , submitted an idea to BP , also posting it on BP Oil News , an independent blog critical of the company . His idea - heavily paraphrased - involves the use of a pipe smaller in diameter than the casing of the oil well . This would have valve at one end and inflatable tubes in the other . Dispersant used - scientists warn it may kill marine life Huge dome placed over leak - became blocked by ice crystals Top hat - smaller dome not yet used Mile-long tube - fails to suck up large amount of oil `` Top-kill '' method to pump heavy mud - abandoned With the valve open , the smaller pipe would be inserted , the tubes quickly inflated to form a seal , cemented in place and then the valve closed . Looking on the web you can see solutions involving pre-cast concrete plugs , giant screws , explosives , sealant pumps , giant magnets , liquid nitrogen , inflatable bladders and all manner of other devices . Mr Redd , who runs a pressure washing and home maintenance business , says he was motivated to try and solve the leak after watching news coverage . `` I was expecting all those engineers to have an idea , that they would have had contingency plans . Eventually it was clear they did n't . `` I 'm looking at it from the point of view of doing home maintenance . If this happened in someone 's house how would I fix it ? '' Prof Steven Sears , chairman of the petroleum engineering department at Louisiana State University , has himself received suggestions in two categories . `` The first are things like using hay to put down on the seashore to absorb the oil . `` The second category is more directed towards stopping the oil flow . Those have been similar to what is being attempted . `` There has n't been in what I 've seen a really novel approach . '' But despite the public enthusiasm , there 's a feeling among some experts - not brought in by BP - that they are n't able to contribute their own ideas because of a lack of detail from the oil firm . `` The problem is there is not a whole lot of detailed information released , '' says Prof Sears . `` Exactly what are the pressures , temperatures , flow rates and pipe sizes ? `` The more information is released the more analysis can be done by people that are not directly involved . '' It will probably be somebody with some sort of engineering or science background who could come up with an answer , says Howe . It is unlikely that `` a random guy with an English degree '' will crack it , he notes . '' -LRB- It might be -RRB- someone who has some tangential experience - it is n't some experience that BP think to tap . '' Harrison was a self-educated genius , who already made clocks , and Leblanc had a scientific background . The prize approach made sense in a time when the pool of formal academics was tiny compared with today . And if an ordinary citizen comes up with the solution , they have to hope that the powers-that-be treat them a bit better than they did Harrison and Leblanc .

The group dedicated to `` Boycott BP '' is gaining over 30,000 members every day and is already around the 350,000 mark . BP invests in a $ 50m ad campaign , NOW ? Come on BP - have the fumes gone to your brains already ??? '' Many vow not to buy BP petrol or products again and express visceral anger towards the oil firm . Some have designed their own logos , satirical takes on BP 's green and yellow livery , featuring dripping oil and skulls . This is an environmental crisis that ordinary people have been able to get to grips with online in a way not possible during the US 's other notorious oil spill , the Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989 . Now the webcam of the broken pipe with the oil gushing into the sea has proved to be compelling viewing . Hundreds of thousands of people have also watched the footage of robot arms doing their work . Florida resident David Kearns has launched a one-man campaign of direct action against BP . He has posted videos on YouTube under the alias Stanley Morton III . One shows him spreading rubbish from his garden over the forecourt of a BP petrol station . Hundreds of thousands have joined a Facebook group demanding a boycott And he attaches banners and placards on fences adjacent to the stations in an effort to get people to stop buying . `` I 'm outraged . We live here for our beaches , for our seafood , '' he says . `` If you get people not to buy the gas at the pumps that hurts them . It is an ` annoycott ' . '' He perceives success when he sees the price of BP petrol go lower than that of its local competitors . `` If the price of gas has gone down , it 's hitting their bottom line . '' BP is cagey over the effects on sales of the oil spill so far , and it has yet to be suggested that they are devastating . The issue will be complicated for many , and such situations can lead to a `` mild consumer response '' , says Prof Monroe Friedman , author of Consumer Boycotts : Effecting Change Through the Marketplace and Media . He says disastrous environmental incidents caused by companies , such as the spill , `` do not necessarily lead to no-buy -LRB- action -RRB- . They lead to symbolic kinds of action , things short of boycotts . `` Few of these gas stations are actually owned by offending companies , most of them are owned by independent operators . `` You are a consumer and you may be offended by the corporate actions but you may continue to buy the gas at your neighborhood station . One thing is convenience , you have been doing it for years . You may know the guy who owns the station . '' It 's a point that has been made by many , who have suggested protesters should only boycott BP products , like Castrol motor oil , but Mr Kearns is not convinced . `` The proprietors are used as human shields , '' he says . TONY HAYWARD AND THE PR DRIVE One lightning rod for anti-BP rage has proved to be chief executive Tony Hayward . Remarks he made at the weekend , when he suggested he wanted the spill to be over and said `` I 'd like my life back '' generated a wave of ire . Tony Hayward apologises for the oil spill on the BP website By Wednesday he had to apologise , but bloggers have unkindly noted that BP has had a second gusher in the form of Mr Hayward 's gaffe-prone mouth . Some newspaper and television commentators have demanded his resignation . One national station ran a segment called `` Fired Up ! He 's Gotta Go '' . And the idea that BP is spending money on print and television adverts has also drawn criticism - a case of a PR drive proving to be bad PR . One Facebook commenter captured the mood , saying : `` BP invests in a $ 50m ad campaign , NOW ? That is a huge waste of $ 50m that should be going towards the CLEAN UP . Come on BP - have the fumes gone to your brains already ??? '' BP has already had to explain that no money is being diverted from the clean-up effort . Mass demonstrations are yet to occur While on the Gulf coast it is easy to see banners and placards attacking BP , the signs of rage may not be visible everywhere . The umbrella group seizeBP.org , which wants the federal government to take all of BP 's assets as punishment for the spill , is organising nationwide protests . But a demonstration at a BP-related site in Washington DC on Thursday only attracted a couple of dozen protesters . Whether the anger will build into mass demonstrations is unclear . WHY ARE N'T PEOPLE MORE ANGRY ? While it is clear that millions are outraged , their response is not always visible , particularly away from the Gulf states . Where the oil is , or is headed , feelings run high `` People do n't feel at liberty to speak of it -LRB- in Louisiana -RRB- , they are dependent on BP to pay them , '' says David Kearns . `` In Florida , people do n't want to say too much because it 's going to hurt tourism . '' But he thinks the longer the effects of the spill last , the more rage will build . `` It 's true we need to be more angry , '' he says . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

'' BP has said it does not expect to be able to fully halt the oil flow until August , when two relief wells will be completed .

Although some of the methods have been tried and tested at incidents elsewhere in the world , they have not been carried out at such great depth as the Deepwater Horizon leak - 5,000 feet -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the surface . 2 JUNE : LOWER MARINE RISER PACKAGE After the failure of the top kill procedure , BP attempts to cut the top off the upper section of the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and place a cap on it , sealing the leak and taking oil to a ship on the surface . After a brief setback with some of the cutting equipment , the cap is installed and BP announces on 4 June that it is collecting oil at a rate of 1,000 barrels a day . The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed . The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section . First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely-operated shear . This was completed at 1930 CDT on 1 June -LRB- 0030 GMT 2 June -RRB- . The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP .

The procedure includes injecting a `` junkshot '' of golf balls , rope and rubber into the BOP in a bid to block the flow . Despite pumping more than 30,000 barrels of heavy mud itno the BOP and a range of junkshot , the operation fails to overcome the flow from the well . 16 MAY : RISER INSERTION TUBE - SUCCESS BP had some success with a `` riser insertion tube '' - a pipe with rubber diaphragm inserted into the leaking part of the riser pipe that is the source of the main oil flow from the well . The insertion tuibe is connected to its own riser pipe that takes the oil and gas to the Transocean Discoverer Enterprise drillship , 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,524 m -RRB- above on the surface . Methanol is injected into the tube to stop the formation of hydrates - crystals that could block the flow of oil and gas . The tube tool has been able to collect about 3,000 barrels a day of oil and some 14 million standard cubic feet a day of gas . The oil is being stored and gas is being flared on the drillship Discoverer Enterprise - which has the capacity to store 139,000 barrels of oil . 8 - 18 MAY : CONTAINER DOME AND TOP HAT - FAILED Plans to place a large containment dome over the main leak and siphon oil to a ship on the surface is aborted as hydrates or ice crystals build up , blocking the pipes . A smaller `` top hat '' dome is lowered to perform a similar task , but engineers decide to use insertion tube instead . Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125-tonne , 18-metre -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor . However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice-like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy . Instead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site . Dubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak . To prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas . The top hat is 1.5 m -LRB- 5 feet -RRB- high and 1.2 m in diameter . Two special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe . This should prevent the build-up of hydrates . Once in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface . BP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface . This time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build-up of hydrates .

The comment came amid US pressure on BP to cut its dividend to help pay for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . He also gave chief executive Tony Hayward the board 's full support , after criticism of his handling of the spill . Before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began , the company had been expected to pay out $ 10.5 bn -LRB- # 7.2 bn -RRB- in dividends over four quarterly payments . However , two US Senators called earlier this week for the dividends to be cut , so money could be diverted to deal with the Gulf of Mexico oil leak . Mr Svanberg indicated that , with the ultimate cost of the spill so uncertain , a decision would be made closer to 27 July , when the next dividend payment is due to be declared . BP 's first quarter dividend of $ 2.6 bn has already been declared , and will be paid on 21 June . BP shares fell at the outset of the call at 1400 BST , before recovering sharply . Mr Svanberg had appeared to duck the question of dividends in his opening comments , stating merely , `` We are aware of the importance of the dividend to you , the shareholders . '' Mr Hayward also avoided any explicit commitment to maintain the company 's dividend on the call . `` We will stand behind all of our commitments , '' he said , before going on to note the need to balance paying dividends with other demands on the company . `` We will meet the obligations to our employees and other stakeholders , including hundreds of thousands of shareholders , '' the BP head said . Mr Hayward said the company had already spent more than $ 1bn -LRB- # 686m -RRB- on dealing with the spill , and expected to continue spending at this rate until some time after the leak is stopped . Estimated cost of sand barrier project : $ 360m Second-quarter dividend to be declared on 27 July At its worst , BP saw 34 % wiped off its value since the oil spill began `` It is simply not possible to put a cost estimate on this at the moment , '' he said . He added that by the time BP releases its second quarter results , due in July , they hoped to have a better idea of the ultimate cost . However , he emphasised that some costs , including fines , remediation costs and lawsuits , would go on for many years . Mr Hayward also said it would be another two days before BP knew whether it had plugged the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . `` It will be a further 48 hours before the system can be optimised , '' he said , adding that only then would they know how much of the oil and gas from the leak was being captured . He said `` everyone at BP is heartbroken '' by the loss of life and economic and ecological damage from the spill , and offered his personal apology .

The beaches are still open , but as oil continues to spurt from the broken well 90 miles away , residents know their troubles are just beginning . So far the coastlines most affected have been in Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi to the west .

We might not think of ourselves as shareholders in a big oil company , but many of us are . If you hold an occupational pension you probably own shares in BP . Investors will have watched last week 's news that the company is to delay a decision on its next dividend payment with concern . BP accounts for about 8 % of all the income going into the UK 's pension funds . But just as the financial crash raised concerns over banking stocks , BP 's Gulf of Mexico spill is leading some to worry about the risks of owning shares in oil companies . Leading economist Lord Stern recently suggested environmental risks including climate change should be factored into long-term investment decisions . `` Investing long-term in ` dirty ' technologies is actually risking their clients money , '' he said referring to pension funds . But is there an alternative ? Most British pensions are partly invested in shares linked to the list of the country 's biggest firms , the FTSE 100 . It comes down to whether BP are doing the right and responsible thing when they are trying to improve safety and so on '' End Quote Adrian Lowcock Investment advisor , Best Invest BP is one of the largest on the list . Before the oil spill it accounted for around 9 % of the FTSE 100 's value . It is also one of relatively few stocks to pay a high dividend . But as new oil gets harder to find , international firms are trying to find it in ever more hazardous locations - a mile under the sea , the Arctic and tar sands . `` Oil companies are increasingly being forced into these extreme frontier environments where the inherent risk is going up and up , '' says Seb Beloe , head of socially responsible investing at fund management firm , Henderson Global Investors . `` Maybe this will prove to be an isolated example , but I would n't be surprised if it was n't . '' Many pension funds do now take into account social , political and environmental risks . Some ethical investment funds do n't buy shares in tobacco companies But avoiding such stocks entirely is difficult . Other big players on the FTSE include fellow oil company Shell , mining giant Rio Tinto , cigarette firm British American Tobacco and defense contractor BAE systems . Leaving out shares in such firms could leave a portfolio unbalanced , and so vulnerable to problems in a particular industry , such as banking . Instead some pension trustees focus on pushing for companies they own to reform practices . `` It comes down to whether BP are doing the right and responsible thing when they are trying to improve safety and so on , '' says Adrian Lowcock an investment advisor from Best Invest . Even companies critical of BP , such as the Co-operative Group , own shares in the firm for their employee pension scheme . `` We engage with management on performance on environmental and social issues , '' says Mike Fox its head of UK equities . There are some private income funds which avoid BP - available to a small number of people . Hendersons has a fund which sold out of the stock after BP 's last safety incident in 2003 . Since the incident it had out-performed the FTSE by more than 2 % - most of that down to not owning plummeting BP shares . But even that fund owns shares in a gas firm . `` If you want a dividend and you do n't want to be in oil and gas I do n't know if there is a fund that can meet those criteria , '' says Mr Beloe . The situation is different when it comes to investments - such as a share ISA . BP boss Tony Hayward has delayed a decision on the dividend Here a range of products offer `` sustainable '' or `` ethical '' ways to invest . There is considerable choice as to what areas you may want to focus on or avoid , from animal testing , to climate change , to encouraging renewable energy . But these investments carry their own risks . `` Funds that choose not to invest in certain markets will always carry some volatility , '' says Mr Fox from the Co-op . To begin with they sometimes exclude many of the companies which do relatively well during a recession . `` Ethical funds suffer from a lack of diversification , '' says Mr Lowcock . `` Defensive companies which are protected from downsides in the market such as alcohol or gambling may not be included . '' During the credit crunch some `` ethical '' investments which avoided oil and mining shares instead held shares in banks and small companies - two big losers . Individual funds vary , but figures from the Investment Management Association -LRB- IMA -RRB- show # 1000 invested in an ethically filtered group of UK companies earned marginally less over the last one , three , five and 10 years than those in a generic basket . The reverse was true for international investments . The recovery has also been led by commodity companies - such as BP . `` That presents a real challenge , '' says Mr Fox . `` And we 've not been exposed to that , so the sustainable market has not been the best-performing . '' Currently # 5.9 bn is invested in ethical funds - an all-time record . But new sales have not been increasing . Gross sales figures from the IMA showed ethical funds accounted for 1.3 % of gross sales in 2007 . That figure had almost halved by the first quarter of 2010 . Many believe the economic recovery and BP oil spill could see a change in this pattern . BP 's shares lost a third of their value after the spill - nothing comparable happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 . `` Things like socially responsible investment and corporate responsibility move in jumps due to shocks to the system , '' says James Marriot from Platform , an NGO critical of the oil and gas industry . He calls stocks such as BP and Shell `` national treasures '' , held by investors because of their reputation for reliable high returns . Some , such as Lord Stern , are now arguing these should be seen as rather more risky investments than they were before . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

In an interview with NBC , Mr Obama was asked about comments Mr Hayward made in the wake of the disaster , which killed 11 people , such as `` I want my life back '' and the Gulf is `` a big ocean '' . Mr Obama said : `` He would n't be working for me after any of those statements . '' He added he had visited the Louisiana coast `` so I know whose ass to kick '' and called for dividends due to be paid to shareholders to instead go into a compensation scheme . The comments have added to the pressure on Mr Hayward 's future . `` He should announce he is going to quit as soon as the oil leak had been stopped . That would take some of the pressure off BP , '' said Hugo Dixon of Reuters Breakingviews . Mr Hayward was a `` liability to the company '' and had `` become the whipping boy '' , he told the BBC . `` He has mishandled the communications quite badly . '' On Sunday Mr Hayward told the BBC his company was going to stop the leak and take care of the consequences . `` We 're going to clean up the oil , we 're going to remediate any environmental damage and we are going to return the Gulf coast to the position it was in prior to this event . That 's an absolute commitment , we will be there long after the media has gone , making good on our promises , '' he said . The oil giant has said the cost of the clean-up operation so far is about $ 1.25 bn . Oil has been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of the US state of Louisiana on 20 April and has been found on beaches and wetlands along more than 100 miles -LRB- 161km -RRB- of coast from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle . A containment cap was lowered over the well last week to siphon off the oil to a containment ship . At a press conference on Tuesday , BP said it had contained more than 14,800 barrels of oil from the leaking wellhead in the previous 24 hours . BP is to donate money from selling the oil recovered in the Gulf of Mexico spill to wildlife protection in the region . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

The Guardian editorial compares the handling of the BP oil spill has to the Bhopal disaster : `` Unthinkable ? Well , that is how the US multinational Union Carbide Corporation , now owned by Dow Chemical , has behaved since it created the world 's worst industrial disaster at Bhopal in central India . The difference between BP and Union Carbide is not just a matter of the location of the disaster , although it is plainly that too . It is also down to the fact that successive national and state governments in India have rolled over time and time again to the realpolitik of dealing with Dow Chemical 's other investments in India . '' George Monbiot argues in the Guardian that BP should not see the money it makes as profit for its shareholders but instead as provision for future liabilities : `` Pollution has been defined as a resource in the wrong place . That 's also a pretty good description of the company 's profits . The great plumes of money that have been bursting out of the company 's accounts every year are not BP 's to give away . They consist , in part or in whole , of the externalised costs the company has failed to pay , and which the rest of society must carry . '' `` Instead BP should try a different tack . It should tell the U.S. , and everybody in it , to go take a hike . In reality , the U.S. is guilty of the most appalling hypocrisy . It 's too late to rescue BP 's reputation now ; all it can realistically hope for is to salvage as much money for shareholders as possible . '' Louisiana Republican governor wrote to the White House to rethink its current ban on offshore drilling because he cares more about the economy than the environment : learning experience about the true cost of this business is wrapped up in the local needs of these economies which clearly Jindal is pandering to rather than taking a leadership position . '' Rachel Maddow says on her MSNBC show that if the oil industry does n't change , it shows the US political system is not working : `` Big oil has been too rich too care about what it was putting us all at risk for .

Adm Thad Allen said oil giant BP needed to do better at getting money to people and businesses affected by the spill . Some 11,000 barrels of oil were being trapped by a containment cap , he said . President Barack Obama defended his response to the spill , using some of his toughest language yet . He said he had frequently consulted with experts in order to learn `` whose ass to kick '' . `` I was down there a month ago before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf , '' he said in an interview with the NBC network . `` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar . We talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers so I know whose ass to kick , '' he added . The president - who has come under criticism that he has not shown enough leadership or anger over the disaster - told Americans they would `` get through this crisis '' , despite the damage to the economy . Mr Obama told reporters he was committed to seeing the Gulf region restored to a condition better than it was before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank on 20 April , killing 11 workers . The leaking wellhead is currently spewing out between 12,000 and 24,000 barrels of oil per day . Meanwhile , Adm Allen , the coordinator of the clean-up operation , told reporters it would take `` a couple of months '' to clear the oil slick from the surface of the Gulf . But , he said : `` Long-term issues of restoring environments and habitats will be years . '' Four US states have now been affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill He said that while BP had nearly doubled the amount of oil being funnelled from the leaking wellhead since Friday , it was now `` trying to increase that production rate , close the venting valves and move to a greater capacity '' . He said BP was hoping to move a second production platform into the area to increase the amount of oil that could be siphoned off . Adm Allen added that BP was also preparing a bigger rig to process a greater capacity of oil in severe weather . Hurricane season in the region opened last week .

This number does not include $ 360m -LRB- # 248m -RRB- for a project to build six sand berms to protect Louisiana 's wetlands from the spreading oil , BP has said . Oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill has been found on beaches and wetlands along more than 100 miles -LRB- 161 km -RRB- of coast from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle . An observation flight spotted a sheen of oil 150 miles west of Tampa , Florida , on Sunday . Tar balls continued to wash ashore on Monday in Pensacola , Florida , and the popular tourist town of Panama City , in the same state , expected oil to reach its beaches within 72 hours . `` We have just entered the area of uncertainty for about half of our beach , '' said Dan Rowe , president of the Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors ' Bureau . He added : `` We are still hoping tar balls do n't show up here , but we are putting the contingency plans in place and everyone is out there looking at the beach and inspecting it . '' Both BP and the US government have been criticised for their responses to the spill . According a survey released on Monday by ABC and the Washington Post , nearly three out of four Americans say that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a major disaster , and the majority of those surveyed want legal action to be taken against BP and its partners . Eight in 10 people surveyed criticise the way BP has handled the spill , and 51 % of people say they feel strongly that the federal government should pursue criminal charges against BP and the other companies involved in the disaster . Nearly seven in 10 gave the government 's response to the spill a negative rating . The US states of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida have so far been affected in the six weeks since the spill began . Attempt to cap oil leak The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed . The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section . First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely-operated shear . This was completed at 1930 CDT on 1 June -LRB- 0030 GMT 2 June -RRB- . The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP . The blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB- ROV -RRB- . After removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface .

But that is precisely what Barack Obama said he would do on Tuesday , prompted by what he considers to be a series of misjudged comments by BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward following the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . And it 's a view shared by many critics , some of whom are BP shareholders , unimpressed by Mr Hayward declaring that he `` just wants his life back '' and that the Gulf is a `` big ocean '' . Such comments have simply served to damage further BP 's already battered reputation in the US and fuel anti-BP anger among many Americans , particularly those directly affected by the spill in Louisiana and beyond . To accusations of negligence and incompetence can now be added charges of indifference in the minds of those incensed by the scale of the spill and the time it has taken for BP to stem the flow of oil . But Mr Hayward 's comments are merely an unfortunate aside to the crisis that engulfs one of the world 's leading oil and gas companies . Tony Hayward 's handling of the disaster has been under scrutiny Shares in BP have slumped almost 40 % since the Deep Horizon oil rig exploded on 20 April , while the clean-up operation has so far cost the company $ 1.25 bn -LRB- # 862m -RRB- . A high cost certainly , but considering the company made a profit of $ 14bn last year , down from $ 25bn in 2008 , one that BP can afford to pay . The 2009 profit was generated from revenues of $ 239bn and , even after its recent share price slump , BP 's market capitalization stands at $ 107bn . The fact that it reports its profit figures in dollars should come as no surprise , for despite its name , BP is very much a global company . It began life as the Anglo Persian Oil Company in 1909 , before becoming British Petroleum in 1954 . In 2000 , it joined with Arco , the US petrol giant , and two years later acquired the German fuel group Aral and lubricant specialist Castrol . Today , the BP brand also encompasses the US convenience store group Ampm and the Wild Bean Cafe chain in the UK . It operates in 80 countries across the world and sells its products and services in more than 100 . It employs more than 80,000 people and runs 22,400 petrol stations globally . Nor is the ownership of BP strictly British . The company is 44 % - owned in the UK , split largely between 33 institutions and seven large individual investors . But , since it is one of the UK 's biggest companies and a major constituent of the FTSE 100 index , many thousands of UK private investors will have exposure to BP though tracker funds and pensions . US investors own 39 % of the company , including 25 institutional and 14 big individual investors . Despite its success , size and profitability , BP is no stranger to controversy . The Deep Horizon spill is certainly a massive challenge to the company , both financially and in terms of public relations , but it is not the first time BP has been in the international spotlight . In 2006 , a US congressional hearing accused BP of `` unacceptable '' neglect of pipelines in Alaska after it was forced to shut down oil operations in Prudhoe Bay because of leaking pipes . In 2007 , the company was fined a total of $ 373m by the US Department of Justice for environmental crimes and committing fraud . The fine included $ 50m relating to a Texas refinery explosion in 2005 that killed 15 people and injured 170 more . The largest single fine of $ 303m related to a price manipulation scam in the propane market . Last October , BP was fined a further $ 87m for failing to correct safety hazards at the Texas refinery . The company has also faced harsh criticism , from shareholders and environmental campaigners , about its plans to develop oil sands in Canada . The methods used to extract oil from these sands give rise to far more carbon emissions than even standard oil drilling , they argue . To some in the US , therefore , the Deep Horizon spill feels all too much like a terrible deja vu . Indeed , given its chequered recent history and experience of controversy , perhaps the most surprising thing about the Gulf oil spill is just how badly BP has handled the publicity surrounding it .

"}, {"uid": "1338", "dct": "2010-06-09", "dates": [], "text": "Thousands have submitted their ideas to BP We asked readers to submit their ideas on how the Gulf of Mexico oil spill should have been stopped . A selection of the hundreds we received has been assessed by Prof Iraj Ershaghi , director of petroleum engineering at the University of Southern California . BP 's cap on the well is currently , according to the company 's estimates , capturing more than half of the oil . But could there be a better way ? `` Drill a hole next to the well . Place a low-yield nuclear warhead and detonate it . `` The power will fuse the rock together and the intense pressure from the sea water will keep the rock in place thus sealing the leak . '' - Michael Murray , Greensboro , North Carolina , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` A nuclear blast would not fuse the pipe under the cooling effect of water but rather would create a crater and would make it impossible to control the flow . '' `` I think you should create a large fabric tube to help control the amount of oil that gets away from the leak . I think something like parachute cloth might work because that fabric is quite a tight weave - water passes through , but I do n't think oil would . `` It might have access panels , especially near the bottom where the actual leaks are occurring , but perhaps that would allow for some kind of pump to pump the oily water that would be held within the tube . '' - Elaine Seniuk , Enfield , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` What forces the oil and water to flow through the fabric is a pressure of close to 7,000 pounds per square inch . We also need to realize the volume being produced -LRB- 15,000-20 ,000 barrels per day or 600,000 to 800,000 gallons a day -RRB- . That means capacity requirements that are impossible to create or install under 5,000 ft of water . '' `` How about using small polystyrene beads impregnated with iron filings to cling to the oil , then pick up the beads with an electromagnet which could be mounted on any number of platforms such as vehicles or boats . Sinking oil harder to collect `` Beads get processed to remove the oil , then re-used . Cheap to produce , easy to collect from water , better than trying to scrape oil off difficult surfaces . Beads would be easily deployable by air\\/sea . '' - Alwyn Turner , Chapel-en-le-Frith , UK Prof Ershaghi says : `` They use straw to help in collecting oil . Any other type of material attachment could result in making the oil drops heavier . Causing the oil droplets to sink will not solve the spill clean-up as we will be polluting the water below the surface . Please also realize , mass production of any new products on the scale of sinking miles of spilled oil on the surface requires months if not years of planning and manufacturing . '' `` How do we block any hole in the earth ? By using the natural resources of the earth itself . I suggest that BP utilise barge after barge of rocks that will sink quickly and directly over the outpouring . `` Enough rocks to create a mini-mountain . Sea bed sand might eventually fill the gaps in the rocks as a kind of cement . '' - Vernon Turner , St Ives , Cambridgeshire , UK Prof Ershaghi says : `` If BP had cut the riser during the first week and had installed a second blowout preventer , a massively heavy 48ft stack , it would have done the equivalent of what you are suggesting . By dropping large pieces of rock , there is no way they can seal all the holes in between the boulders to stop the flow . Use of soft sand will not work for sealing the holes as the flow of high pressure oil and gas will blow away sediment and rocks . '' `` Wrap electromagnets at different sections of the pipe and secure . Inject small metal material into pipe to be attracted to magnets . As material adheres to inside of pipe , inject slightly larger material . Make sure electromagnets are powerful enough . Like ` top kill ' and would n't work `` Eventually , the flow will decrease and perhaps stop just like a clogged artery in the human body . Remember , power to the magnets must not stop until the pipe is safely capped . '' - Anon Prof Ershaghi says : `` BP was trying to inject high pressure mud and could not fight the upward flow of oil and gas . It is hard to inject the materials you are suggesting with fluid unless they are pulverized . If they could have been injected , they would have been subjected to the upward pressure and could not have entered the casing . '' `` I think that the hole could be plugged to greatly reduce the flow , if not end it , by sinking an old ship over the leak . A ship might not create a seal `` If extra ballast were added to the ship to make it even heavier , it would exert enough pressure to seal the hole . '' - Howard H Rothman , Bridgeport , Connecticut , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` If we used your idea , the weight of the sunken vessel must be enough to overcome the upward force of the fluid while also a tight seal is required over the casing . A better idea is still , as mentioned above , placing another blowout preventer after cutting the riser . '' `` What will contain it is simply an enormous funnel in thin mild steel which can be lowered over the whole mess with enough pipe of suitably flexible material and diameter to guide the oil to the surface , where of course it will need a constant supply of tankers to suck\\/pump it safely aboard . The current cap is better `` Obviously the flow-rate and rate of rise needs to be well estimated to get the diameter of the mile of pipe to the surface . '' - G Vert Vaughan , Veliko Tarnovo , Bulgaria Prof Ershaghi says : `` What BP has done in terms of connecting the Lower Marine Riser Package -LRB- the cap on top of the blowout preventer -RRB- to take the oil to the surface is similar to your idea , except , they did not have to make a huge funnel to accommodate 800,000 gallons of oil per day . '' `` Manufacture a series of 30cm custom plugs , each tapered at the front like a bullet . Each plug must have the same diameter as the inner diameter of the tube -LRB- minus 2mm to prevent jamming on the way in -RRB- . However , along the sides of the plugs , cut 100 small diagonal incisions . Thus the plug will look like it is barbed . Damaging the well casing would be catastrophic `` It will go in easily , but dig itself in when going out , plus the more pressure exerted by the gas , the deeper the plug will dig into the pipe sides . Clearly , the plug must be made of a metal harder than the pipe , or it wo n't be able to do this . Use a pneumatic or even limited explosive charge to deliver the plugs . I suggest a minimum of two - that 's how we seal basement leaks in Canada , after all . '' - Dave Lundy , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` Maintaining the integrity of the casing is extremely critical . Use of any hard materials or force against the casing is counter-productive as bursting of the casing could occur . That would make it impossible to control the flow . '' `` The most obvious solution to me is to use a bladder that is inserted deep into the pipeline , then pumped up with a high pressure medium . Once the flow has stopped and the feed line removed , the end of the pipe may be sealed by whatever caps are required . Coiled tubing might have been an option `` Alternatively , once the pipe is repaired and if it is to be used again the bladder may be deflated . '' - Mike Konshak , Louisville , Colorado , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` BP could not have done anything of this sort until they cut the riser . One practical solution similar to yours is the use of industry standard coiled tubing . Yes , they could have done that to pump high pressure fluid to fight the well pressure . But one has to be careful not to burst the casing . '' `` Being an ex-plumber , the only way to deal with a pressurized leak is to keep the open end and connect a fitting to the pipe , then shut the fitting when the pipe connection is made . Underwater and at 5,000 ft , you would need to use a skirt , fixed to an open-ended pipe . The skirt could be split on one side . This could be drawn down over the broken pipe end and fixed to a sound portion of the broken pipe , away from the break . Similar to using a second blowout preventer `` This could be fixed in place using traditional mechanical fittings , but it is not taking the strain yet , as the pressurized stream is going up the new open pipe and through the split skirt . Then you can slowly draw the skirt closed , re-strengthening the fixings on the sound part of the broken pipe , thus allowing the skirt to take more strain of the pressurized flow . The skirt can be drawn to a close , as the fixings are made good behind it and the pressurized stream will flow up the new pipe to awaiting vessels . '' - Paul , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` The practical way to use your idea , as discussed above , would have been to actually install another blowout preventer over the existing one after BP managed to cut the riser . They did not do that . Still , if the containment device does not stop the flow , they may have to resort to that option . '' `` To stop the oil flow in the pipe in the Gulf of Mexico , form a funnel that fits into the open pipe and also grips it below the top outside to keep it stable . Pour lead balls of the right size into the funnel to definitely sink into the oil flow despite its speed . They need to be as small as possible while being big enough to be sure to sink . They must be less than about a third of the width of the opening in the funnel to avoid self-jamming in the funnel or pipe and not so large that venturi forces around the balls -LRB- from increased oil flow speeds passing the balls -RRB- stop them from sinking . Like the failed ` junk shot ' `` Reduce the size of the lead balls as the reduced oil flow speed allows smaller ones to sink . When enough lead balls have been fed in to slow down the oil speed , start putting clay balls into the oil pipe . When enough of them have been fed in , put in more lead balls -LRB- or steel balls would do by this stage -RRB- . These last balls will , under the action of gravity , then deform the clay balls to form a seal in the pipe . '' - Peter Keogh , Olso , Norway Prof Ershaghi says : `` Your idea falls in the category of the junk shot that BP found was not successful . '' `` Could the pipe be crimped shut ? I have read that ` giant shears ' were used to cut the pipe , so why not ` giant pliers ' ? Since capping and siphoning seem problematic , crimping , even if not complete and permanent , should diminish the flow at least partially and until the relief wells or other means can ameliorate the situation . Similar to what blowout preventer should have done `` Once crimping was used it would deform the pipe so that capping or siphoning would be almost impossible . '' - Julian P Crane , Everett , Massachusetts , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` Yes , if the blind ram - a device that forms a seal - had worked on the blowout preventer , that was exactly the way the seal process would have taken place to close the casing . '' `` Epoxy might be a better top kill method than mud , and in any case a heavier solid is needed - try bismuth and\\/or iron shot . Delivering the resin and catalyst into the well requires two tubes , though an intermediate pulse of isopropyl alcohol may have a chance or separating the two liquids in a single feed tube , there 'd be a risk of simply clogging the feed tube before it reached the well . Firing a warhead into the well not wise `` Another alternative plug is a torpedo , wire-guided , with a low speed mode -LRB- or restrictor -RRB- for manoeuvring into place , and an extended warhead holding just enough charge to split containers of epoxy monomer and catalyst . '' - Jeremy , New Jersey , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` A torpedo or any warhead entering the casing would have made this a major catastrophe as the loss of casing integrity would have resulted in a crater with continuous and uncontrollable oil flow for the next 30-40 years depending on the amount of oil in the reservoir . '' `` Use an umbrella plug , which would be deployed into the well to the point where the drill borehole breached the well , effectively capping from the inside . Umbrella could not withstand pressure `` You could let the pressure of the well secure the plug or fix it to the seabed . '' - Shayne Dawe , Plymouth , UK Prof Ershaghi says : `` Umbrella type materials that can collapse to fit the pipe and then expand under pressure can not withstand 6,000-7 ,000 pounds per square inch of pressure . '' `` They should drill another hole into the same well and continue collecting the oil . This would diminish the pressure in the currently leaking system , and make it possible to seal the leak . Relief well must go in at an angle `` If it is possible to hit the current well by drilling into it at an angle , this ` shallow ' drill may be faster and easier to do than going all the depth into the reservoir . '' - Alex , Boston , Massachusetts , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` At the site there are a lot of vessels , the relief well needs to be away from them . You have to go down and then angle it , when you dig the relief well . '' `` It appears that below the cut that they have made before capping the pipe , there is a section of the pipe that is bolted , which combines the two sections of pipe . Would n't it be possible to remove the bolts and attach a new section of pipe , bolting the new piece on incrementally , which would allow some leverage in allowing for a rotation of the new section into place . Necessary torque difficult under water `` The new section could have a valve that could be closed off once this section is put into place , thereby minimizing the pressure that they would face when installing this new section . '' - John Allison , Doylestown , Pennsylvania , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` Such operations would require a tremendous amount of torque and this is very difficult with robots and underwater . '' `` To clean up the spill itself they could use a hydrocarbon polymer which attaches itself to oil and produces a sponge-like material which would be easier to clean up , or scoop up . These polymers are used , but sheer volume problematic `` They could even dye the polymer so that the resultant material is much more visible and again easier to collect . '' - Steve , Bermuda Prof Ershaghi says : `` Materials similar to what you are proposing are used , but the sheer magnitude of the amounts needed to treat the volume of oil and the timely spread and collection in a speedy manner is not easily manageable . '' `` I know that a lot of wells in the Gulf of Mexico are difficult to produce because of hydrate -LRB- methane ice -RRB- formation . The containment dome failed because of this . Has the idea of promoting the formation of hydrates within the wellbore itself , to form an ice plug to stop the flow of hydrocarbons , been considered ? Freezing would not reliably block the well `` With a reservoir that does not have free water , and producing at above hydrate curve temperatures , the hydrates will not form until the gas has expanded and cooled the surrounding area -LRB- Joule Thompson effect -RRB- . However , if ice cold , fresh water were pumped into the wellbore , perhaps with some ice crystals or grains of sand , or something to promote the seed required to help the hydrate cage form , that may promote the formation of a hydrate plug within the wellbore itself . '' - Mike , Stony Plain , Alberta , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` You are correct . In fact , hydrate can form near the mud line close to the sea bed . Even if some restrictions develop , this is not a reliable way to stop the flow . A simple change of thermodynamics can change the conditions .

'' None of the companies would comment on what the move is costing BP but Scott Slatin , who runs the New York-based search engine marketing company Rivington , told ABC he estimated it would be more than $ 10,000 a day to maintain the various search terms . `` They paid to lock themselves into the first position against the oil spill terms , essentially putting a positive message on top of the news . '' Art Brodksy at Public Knowledge , which is a Washington DC-based public interest group working to defend users ' rights in the emerging digital culture , is not so sure it is a winning strategy . `` Sponsored links are a fact of life on search engines but a sponsored link probably does n't means much compared to oil covered birds .

Anadarko certainly has a large share in the field and would , I would have thought , be liable for some of the costs . The rig would be operated under both Transocean 's and BP 's procedures , both of which would have been examined prior to any contracts being signed . The rig has been contracted to BP for a significant period of time hence both BP and Transocean personnel would be very familiar with each other 's procedures . Halliburton , though , do not operate the rig . Halliburton provide a cementing service directly to BP -LRB- Transocean has no part in a decision as to who provides this or 95 % of the other services on the rig -RRB- and will follow the BP drilling program . We do n't know the cause of the leak or whether something else should have stopped the leak . It is possible that the BOPs may have prevented the rig ultimately sinking but may not have prevented the tragic loss of 11 men initially . This knee-jerk decision to stop drilling is completely wrong in my view - agree that , yes , everyone 's procedures must and will be reviewed , but the potential for drilling contractors to go bust as either their rigs and people have no work or for operators having to pay fortunes for rigs which they are not allowed to us will have a long-term effect on the supply of oil and gas . Indeed the effect will be significant on the US balance of payments if they have to import more oil - operators in other countries may take some of these very high-tech rigs in operation in the GOM out of the US and on hire elsewhere and then who will drill for these resources ? People wo n't want to keep their rigs in the Gulf if there is no work for them . I 'm not of the ` drill drill drill ' brigade but equally so we all stand responsible - we need cars , buses and trains and many products made from oil . We have to look at the very long term and replacements for hydrocarbons but until we all stand up and be counted and reduce our use these Obama decisions will do nobody any good - this oil in challenging environments is needed for the US . As far as this criticism of BP goes - US companies themselves stand accused of some of the worst industrial disasters in history and their senior management and owners were protected when they were culpable of serious dereliction of duty eg Union Carbide and Bhopal and Oxy and Piper Alpha . So lets take a more balanced view of things - would BP get such a hard time if it was American ? I doubt it . . It is an apalling way to recieve a `` wake up '' call . When it comes to energy America in endemically complacent , and a crisis has been due for some time American national governance deliberately places a light regulatory touch on `` Industry '' in order to promote entrepreneurial spirit and grow its enonomy in a competitive world - greed , always in the background , lends a supporting hand . Enron , Worldcom , The international banking debt crisis - all have emanated from America 's shores for much the same reason . This scandalous crisis was avoidable , the problems were well known , preparatory , but costly engineering solutions available . Only a nation with exaggerated optimism drills for oil a mile below the ocean without having an effective plan B to cover the worse case .

The state is going to see a decrease in income taxes and sales taxes that would normally be paid by those employees . -LRB- The state does not collect a sales tax on oilfield supplies and equipment used offshore . -RRB- Shell has seven -LRB- 7 -RRB- exploratory wells that will be impacted ATP Oil & Gas -LRB- 2 -RRB- The 33 gulf wells where operations are suspended were the ones inspected immediately after the Deepwater Horizon blowout -LRB- per Interior Secretary Ken Salazar -RRB- ; in those inspections , only minor problems were found on a couple of rigs . Salazar believes additional safety measures can be taken including dealing with cementing and casing of wells and significant enhancements and redundancies of blowout prevention mechanisms . Although these rigs passed the inspections , we will look at standards that are in place . Longer term impacts include - Idle drilling rigs in the Gulf could mean that they will be contracted overseas for work in other locations , and if\\/when the halt is lifted , rigs will not be available for completing the work in the Gulf . Loss of tolls on LA Highway 1 resulting from loss of traffic related to deepwater operations ; tolls go directly to retiring the bond debt for construction of LA Highway 1 improvements , and if those tolls are lost , the state of Louisiana as the other responsible party on the bonds - will have to pay to retire that debt , meaning loss of funding for some other programs in the state s budget . A 6-month halt in new drilling would defer 80,000 barrels\\/day , or 4 % of 2011 deepwater Gulf of Mexico production . -LRB- Wood MacKenzie -RRB- Higher drilling costs might jeopardize exploration in frontier areas . More immediately , estimates are that seven current discoveries could be rendered sub-economic , putting U.S. $ 7.6 billion in future government revenues at risk . Proposals to increase the cap on oil companies liability for oil spill damages to U.S. $ 10 billion could exclude U.S. independents from offshore Gulf of Mexico activities . -LRB- Wood MacKenzie -RRB- Since these wells are not yet producing , there is no decrease in the available oil supply . However , it could lead to a decrease in the availability of domestic oil , and it is hard to tell how commodity speculators are going to respond over the next six months ; there is the possibility for driving oil prices to levels well over $ 100 per barrel .

The fact that BP has obviously been paying its minions to comment on this article is disgusting . Why are they wasting money on politics when they should fix the damn problem in the Gulf . I am sorry but the time for social web 2.0 dirty work is over . stop the leak and clean up . How is this going to look when the 1st hurricane hit 's the region . Also it is not only USA that is suffering , all the nations in the Gulf are at risk . BP is trash and the obvious planted comments are proof . But on this matter with BBC I find it hard to trust BBC . If you lived here what you would realize is that the BBC gets slated regularly . Generally whichever government is in power will see it as being opposed to it and accuse it of bias . If you were aware of many of the scandals that have taken place here over the last few years you would realize that we are a pretty cynical nation and hold the BBC to task as much as you do . We are equally wary of the establishment and big business too . I have been to the gulf states about 5 times so not unaware of the situation , also visited several other ares of the US and appreciate the beauty of the country . Likewise , if a similar issue happened in the North sea most of Europe 's main fishing grounds would be destroyed so be assured that people across here do not take what is happening there as a joke and as an industry we are keen to know what happened and learn the lessons to stop re-occurrence . Sorry you appear to be so biased against BP - obviously we will not be able to convince you that we are not paid by them . It discredits what you say , describing them as trash - having experienced many US operators , I know whose rigs I would rather be on . You can choose to rubbish what I say but I 've been there and seen operations at first hand . You are right , though , US TV is trash , BBC is not perfect but at least has some degree of impartiality . At 10:36 pm on 11 Jun 2010 , OldSaltoftheSea wrote : Obama is at fault .

Ultimately the person responsible for the effects of disaster is the person who sanctioned the $ 75m liability cap .

It 's not a question of ethics on the part of the operators - it is down to the regulators to set the rules of the game and down to the operators to play by those rules . So when people say BP is culpable for not having a `` Plan D '' ready to be scrambled just in case plans A-C failed -LRB- which happened -RRB- the truth is that if BP did have such resources standing by `` just in case '' then BP would not be operating the field in the first place - a cheaper operator would have outbid them for the licence , without a `` Plan D '' . The regulators knew what they were doing - lower liability cap equals lower oil price . They wanted cheaper oil . If Obama wants to go finger pointing he should stand in front of the mirror .

Chris Caddell says usually at this time of year business is booming but not at the moment : `` Usually around this time , the beaches would be crowded . But we -LRB- only -RRB- have small business now and then . '' With oil coming ashore in Florida , President Barack Obama has launched his fiercest attack so far on the boss of BP Tony Hayward .

But he sought to reassure senators that the moratorium - imposed after the huge Gulf of Mexico spill - was a `` pause '' rather a permanent halt to exploration . Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen said the amount of oil captured from the leaking well could almost double by next week . President Barack Obama has criticised BP 's efforts to deal with the spill . He is due to make his fourth trip to the Gulf of Mexico next week . Mr Salazar 's announcement came a day after he announced plans to bolster safety requirements for shallow-water oil drilling . He said that drilling would continue , but it `` has to be done in a safe way '' . Mr Salazar said the pause , which was put in place following the 20 April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , would remain `` until we can have a sense of safety , until we have a sense that this can never happen again '' . Mr Salazar also told the panel he would ask BP to repay the salaries of any workers laid off due to the six-month moratorium . Three committees and two subcommittees on Capitol Hill were to discuss matters related to the oil spill and oil industry on Wednesday . Among the new safety regulations announced by Mr Salazar on Tuesday , oil companies drilling in US waters will now have to inspect their blow-out preventers and provide safely certificates . The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill is having a devastating impact on the environment and the economy of the Gulf Coast states and their communities '' End Quote Adm Thad Allen US Coast Guard The failure of the blow-out preventer on the Deepwater Horizon rig led to the oil spill , the worst in US history . A containment cap placed on the blown-out well last week is now helping to contain some of the leaking oil . Adm Allen said in a press conference on Wednesday that the containment operation was now catching up to 630,000 gallons -LRB- 2,864,037 litres -RRB- daily . He said he hoped the existing containment structure would soon be able to hold 1.17 million gallons per day . `` We 're only at 15 -LRB- 15,000 barrels -RRB- now and we 'll be at 28 -LRB- 28,000 barrels -RRB- next week . We 're building capacity , '' said Adm Allen . At some point there might `` have to be a transition between a containment cap and a regular cap '' , he said . Adm Allen added that Obama administration officials were talking to BP about a longer-term containment strategy with `` built-in redundancies '' . The government has estimated that 600,000 to 1.2 million gallons a day are leaking from the bottom of the sea . BP 's efforts to tackle the spill have come under close scrutiny BP has said it will donate net revenues from the oil recovered to a fund to restore wildlife habitats on the coastlines of four affected Gulf Coast states . However , a BP spokesman told the AP news agency that it could not say how much of the recovered oil had been processed . Adm Thad Allen wrote to BP on Tuesday demanding `` more detail and openness '' about how the company is managing claims for compensation payments to individuals and businesses in the region . `` The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill is having a devastating impact on the environment and the economy of the Gulf Coast states and their communities , '' he wrote . Meanwhile , tests have shown that underwater oil plumes have traveled at least 64km -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- from the leaking well , the US government says . Scientists noted that concentrations of oil in the plumes were `` very low '' , but said the plumes were very difficult to clean up , and they could damage the Gulf 's abundant sea life by depleting oxygen in the water . Speaking on US network NBC 's Today show on Wednesday , BP spokesman Doug Suttles maintained BP 's position that no massive underwater oil plumes in `` large concentrations '' had been detected . `` It may be down to how you define what a plume is here , '' he said . Oil has been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of the US state of Louisiana , killing 11 workers . The morning the rig exploded , a BP executive and an official from Transocean , which operated the rig , argued over how to proceed with the drilling , survivors of the blast told CNN . The workers said BP had routinely cut corners and pushed ahead despite concerns about safety . A BP spokesman said it would not comment on specific allegations until an investigation into the accident was completed , but said that `` BP 's priority is always safety '' . BP chief Tony Hayward is scheduled to appear before Congress next week . BP shares fell 3.4 % on Wednesday over worries that the company will have to suspend its dividend payments to pay for legal claims and cleaning up the spill .

The firm 's shares closed down 6.6 % in London , having earlier plunged 12 % . And the row over the spill has moved to Westminster - with calls for the UK government to try to ease relations between BP and the White House . Prime Minister David Cameron will discuss BP with US President Barack Obama this weekend . Mr Cameron said he understood Washington 's `` frustration '' at the spill , adding that the UK stood ready to help BP with the clean-up - referring to 600 tons of chemical dispersant that have been made available . Meanwhile Chancellor George Osborne , who has spoken to BP chief executive Tony Hayward , said : `` We are all concerned about the human and environmental impact . '' He added that `` constructive solutions '' were needed , emphasising that people `` remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America '' . The US is considering taking legal action to prevent BP paying dividends . And concern has been expressed by MPs about the damage that such action could do to one of the UK 's top companies . However the UK government has played down fears expressed by some senior figures of `` anti-British rhetoric '' in the US . The US state department has said the oil spill will not affect the relationship between the US and Britain . BP 's shares recovered some of the losses during London trading hours to end 6.6 % lower at 365.5 pence . The recent price moves mean the oil giant 's share price has almost halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on 20 April . The company has come under increasingly sharp attack by some US politicians for its handling of the spill , described as the worst environmental disaster the US has faced . Some of the sharpest comments have come from President Obama , who said he was looking for `` ass to kick '' at BP , and that he would have sacked BP chief executive Tony Hayward - if he worked for him - over flippant comments about the scale of the spill . Robert Peston Business editor , BBC News Overnight , the US Justice Department said it was examining ways of forcing BP to suspend its dividend until BP 's full liability for the oil spill is known with more precision . And the Justice Department is only doing what influential US politicians are demanding . Which is a serious concern to BP , in that it may be a British company by dint of history and legal domicile , but it is very American by virtue of its giant acquisitions of a decade or so ago . My conversations with those at the top of BP indicate that they 're increasingly minded to go for a voluntary moratorium on dividend payments , to bring some kind of fragile truce to hostilities with the US government . But President Obama should be aware that such a suspension of dividends would in effect deprive US savers of some $ 4bn of income per annum . Or to put it another way , in a world of global capitalism , Obama ca n't punish BP and expect all or even most of the pain to be felt in Britain . London Mayor Boris Johnson told the BBC that BP had paid a `` very , very heavy price '' , and expressed concern that the oil spill was beginning to damage the entire image of the UK in the US . `` I do think there 's something slightly worrying about the anti-British rhetoric that seems to be permeating from America , '' he told BBC Radio 4 's Today program . However , UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has downplayed the extent of anti-British feelings across the Atlantic . `` No-one has used an anti-British tone in anything that I 've detected , '' he told the BBC . And Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also played down the prospect of UK-US relations being damaged . `` It is about dealing with the ecological problem and dealing with it as soon as possible , '' he said . However the former British ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer , told the BBC that the BP issue had become `` a bit of a crisis , politically '' . `` The government must put down a marker with the US administration that the survival and long-term prosperity of BP is a vital British interest , '' he said . He added that with nearly 40 % of BP shares held in the US the company was `` a pretty vital American interest too , fully integrated into US energy infrastructure '' . And the remarks by President Obama prompted Royal Sun Alliance chairman John Napier to write an open letter to the president , saying criticism of the company lacked `` balance '' and was `` unstatesmanlike '' . He told the BBC : `` The language and rhetoric of this dispute is going into the danger zone , is becoming too highly personalised and to that extent , the interpretation over here , not just by me but others , is that it has a certain anti-British rhetoric to it - and that has to be of concern . '' US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that BP should compensate other oil companies that have had to lay off workers because of a moratorium on deep sea drilling announced by President Obama in response to the Gulf of Mexico spill . Meanwhile , the US Attorney General said he could not rule out taking action to force BP to withhold its next dividend payment - something which former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said was `` quite intolerable '' . The drop in BP 's share price is already bad news for UK pension funds , which invest heavily in the firm . The oil company has said that it pays # 1 in every # 7 of dividends that pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies . However the National Association of Pension Funds -LRB- NAPF -RRB- has insisted that BP 's woes `` should not have an immediate or serious impact on those saving into a pension , or on those who have retired '' . Cable : `` I do n't want to get into the business of lecturing the American government '' It added that pension funds have shifted out of UK shares and that the average fund was now spread across many companies and many types of global asset . In its latest update on the spill , BP sought to reassure investors that it was on a strong financial footing with a stronger-than-forecast cash flow . It also said that the total actual cost to date was some $ 1.43 bn -LRB- # 1bn -RRB- . This compares with a total of # 55bn that has been wiped off BP 's value since the spill began . Market nerves have also been reflected in the value of BP 's bonds , which now trade at levels comparable with junk-rated companies .

'' Tracy Wareing , an official at the US National Incident Command office , said an understanding on expediting the payment of claims had been reached at a meeting with BP executives including CEO Tony Hayward .

In addition to these comments , his officials have begun referring to `` British Petroleum '' - a name the company has not used since 1998 . With UK industry increasingly uneasy at what they feel are attempts to label Britain as the villain , the blame game risks turning into a diplomatic row . Sir Christopher Meyer , former British ambassador to the US , told the BBC that the issue had become `` a bit of a crisis , politically '' for the American and UK governments . Miles Templeman , director general of the Institute of Directors , said that some of the language being used by the Obama administration was simply `` inappropriate '' . He believes there is a danger that the crisis will be turned into a US versus UK issue , `` and there will be prejudice against British companies because of it '' . At the CBI employers ' group , director general Richard Lambert also believes it is time to calm the rhetoric . There is something merciless about how the US political class will gang up on foreign business class '' End Quote John Hofmeister Former president , Shell Oil He told the Financial Times that Mr Obama 's attack on BP was `` obviously a matter of concern - politicians getting heavily involved in business in this way always is '' . And he pointed out : `` Apart from anything else , BP is a vital part of the US energy infrastructure . '' BP 's US assets are the result of mergers and takeovers of American companies . BP 's international expansion was one reason why dropping the name `` British '' made sense . So , Sir Christopher said : `` BP is a pretty vital American interest - fully integrated into US energy infrastructure '' . And while the company may be based in London , and have a British chief executive , Tony Hayward , 39 % of BP 's shares are held by US institutions and individuals , according to figures on the oil giant 's website . About 40 % of the shares are UK-owned . Many observers believe the Obama administration 's recent harder line on BP has much to do with criticism of the president 's handling of the crisis and forthcoming elections . Furthermore , there appears little evidence that anti-British , as opposed to anti-BP , sentiment is widespread in grassroots America . An - admittedly unscientific - trawl through various newspaper websites and blogs in Louisiana and beyond found no suggestion that the `` British '' were to blame . As one oil industry analyst , who asked not to be named , told the BBC : `` I bet there was more anti-Yank feeling here when Kraft bought Cadbury than there is anti-Brit feeling in America over the oil spill . '' BP chief Tony Hayward has become a lightening rod for abuse and ridicule Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to raise the use of Mr Obama 's aggressive rhetoric during a regular telephone conversation with the president this weekend . But the Foreign Secretary , William Hague , said on Thursday that he was not aware of any anti-British sentiment generated by the Gulf of Mexico disaster . Even so , some experts believe Mr Hayward should have kept a lower profile during the crisis , and left BP 's US executives to take the lead . John Hofmeister , former president of Shell Oil , the US subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell , said : `` I think it was a mistake for Tony Hayward to come and put his physical presence in the US . `` The US has its own culture and traditions . Foreign companies can come and do business there , but they are not necessarily welcomed . '' Mr Hofmeister agreed that Mr Hayward was `` damned if he did and damned if he did n't '' go to America . But the former Shell executive added : `` BP has very senior executives in the US - Americans who are totally competent in what they do . I think it would be more appropriate for them to take the heat . `` There is something merciless about how the US political class will gang up on foreign business class . '' Critics of Mr Hayward say he has not distinguished himself during the disaster , making comments about `` wanting my life back '' and over-optimistic assessments about BP 's ability to contain the spillage . The chief executive has become the lightening rod for abuse and ridicule , with chat show host Jay Leno summing up the mood when he called Mr Hayward `` Mr Haywire '' . But , to paraphrase some of the Louisiana website comments : `` It 's not about being anti-British , it 's about being anti-incompetent . '' The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

He has often referred to BP as `` British Petroleum '' when discussing the disastrous oil leak , even though the company has not used this name since 1998 . Although BP was founded as a British company and has a British boss in Tony Hayward , BP is very much a global company : it 's 44 % owned in the UK , split largely between 33 institutions and seven large individual investors . US investors own 39 % of the company , including 25 institutional and 14 big individual investors . Is the US using the British history of BP for political motives ? Has the oil spill made you think differently about Britain ? Does the history of a multi-national matter ? How should Britain respond ? This debate is now closed . Thank you for your comments .

If we are going to go down this road , perhaps the UK government should seek compensation for the knock on effect of the US mortgage crisis , upon the UK economy .

We should n't , this is an American problem and will require an American solution . It has nothing to do with Britain and the only British people involved are those BP shareholders who happen to be British . Certain sections of the American government will use the British label as a way of hiding the fact that the United States has failed to regulate their oil extraction industry properly and that deep water exploration and extraction regulations were written by the American Petroleum Institute , an organization owned by the major US oil companies . The U.S. Minerals Management Service needs to be adapted or broken up so that they 're no longer responsible for writing the rules regulating offshore drilling and also leasing land on the outer continental shelf and collecting royalties on the oil and gas they produce because this dual responsibility is a conflict of interest . On the one hand they 're meant to be regulating the industry but at the same time they 're trying to maximize the profits that will be generated for the US government from off-shore oil extraction . As is so often the case , this Federal Government Agency is staffed with former executives of the industry it is supposed to be regulating and this has lead to a situation where the industry is effectively regulating itself . This is just another example of the revolving door policy that exists between Capitalist governments and Corporations and the damage this can do to our environment and economies .

Q , - Has the oil spill made you think differently about Britain ? To certain extent I suppose Q , - How should Britain respond ? As far as BP is concerned they are a multi-national organization and thus the weight of responsibility for this mess falls to them . Any association between us as a nation and them as an organization is predominantly in name only and what we receive as an end product . However , we as a nation could offer some assistance with the clear up . We are talking about a massive environmental calamity and nationality aside we should be doing what we can to assist with its clear up . I mean , we all -LRB- globally -RRB- benefit from the end product and thus must all chip in when the `` proverbial '' hits the fan . In answer to Obama and his attempts to highlight that this is British , all I would like to say is Union Carbide anyone ? Has BP damaged Britain 's reputation ? They should n't have done , they are barely a British company . But unfortunately because they happen to have ` British ' in their title . Unfortunately in the eyes of many Americans , particularly those influenced by the right wing press , Britains reputation has indeed been damaged . Still , on the plus side it might be an oppurtunity for breakaway - We could pull out of Afghanistan and stop blindly following the US middle east ` peace policy ' for a start . in the past I have been critical of Obama , however , I approve of his stand on this matter , too often have `` business leaders '' adopted a cavalier attitude to any criticism of their `` devil take the hindmost as long as we make money '' attitude . This President has called for the `` Robber Barons '' of British share holders to take some responsibilty for their collective greed .

I do think this vitirol is mostly political and if Britain responds i think it should be in a calm measured approach , but in some way that bring home to the US that Britain is supposed to be an ally . There are a couple of things we could do that would be very politically embarassing the Obama ; some very public comments about shutting down all US bases in the UK & UK overseas territories would be one . But i think a more quiet word from the PM to Obama would be wiser at this point in time ; with maybe a subtle threat of immediately pulling out of Afganistan .

It is a matter of recored that Mr. Hayward was in the Gulf within days of the initial incident , despite claims by Mr Obama that he was there a month before any `` talking heads '' showed up . With no idea about the technical challenge Obama has told us he is responsible , but all he has done is talk and distract the key effort of sorting the problem by launching legal investigations before any official investigation of the root cause has been completed . For a country with 3 % of global reserves and 25 % usage -LRB- quoted by a US politician -RRB- , with significant dependence on oil , and wealth generated by Oil and associated companies over the past century , the persistant and biased attack on BP is so short sighted that one has to wonder who is advising the US administration . The investigation , when it comes , will surely show a timeline involving a company applying every expert , technology and resource that can be applied to the problem , side tracked by a government more interested in political buck passing than actually helping . To BP 's credit it continues to acknowledge and thank the genuine support and cooperation of Adm. Allen and the other agencies and companies seeking to get this resolved . However , even Adm. Allen has been forced to distance himself it seems , now sending letters to Mr. Hayward - all the US administration has succeeded in doing , publically at least is drive a wedge between parties working hard to limit the damage and the leak . As for an ineffective claims process , has anyone independent actually tested the process ? On CNN it highlights that part of the problem is local fishermen cannont prove income because they do n't have tax reciepts - what is BP then supposed to do if US citizens can not prove legal employment ? The slide in share price is unjustified . Does examination of the last year 's trading accounts look that bleak ? Gearing is , what , less than 20 % ? And all other assets are operating well . Without doubt Mr. Cameron should discuss this with Mr. Obama , but I doubt that he has any intention of listening . Despite significant investment and employment in the US , the administration continues to posture . Suggestions of seizure of assets must worry many BP employees about their futures : I do n't know how many fishermen there are that do n't pay tax , but all BP US employees must do .

If this part of the Gulf is environmentally sensitive then why does the US grant licences for Offshore drilling here ? Is n't this where the true accountability begins and ends ? Why was Obama all in favor of offshore drilling before the accident ? Is he flip flopping ? Is he still in favor of Offshore Drilling ? If an investigation finds that Transocean 's -LRB- the rig operator -RRB- incompetence led to the explosion and Halliburton 's cementing of the well was done badly -LRB- and on the cheap -RRB- and contributed to the explosion and the leak - will he be taking these companies to task with the same vitriol and demands for compensation ? If they were to do this then this would leave Obama with no more room to blame the Evil British and thus his presidential impotence in the face of an environmental disaster will be exposed for all to see .

There is also a chance that BP will end up not paying dividends this year and it is almost certain that the amount BP is having to pay out for the clean-up in the US will eventually affect the dividend . `` When you consider the huge exposure of British pension funds to BP it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great British company is being continually beaten up on the airwaves , '' Boris Johnson said . UK pension funds do indeed have big holdings of BP shares and the company says that # 1 of every # 7 paid in dividends to pension funds by FTSE 100 companies last year came from BP . It is estimated that about 18 million people in the UK either own BP shares or pay into a pension fund that holds BP shares . BP paid # 930m in UK tax on its profits in 2009 , which was well down on the # 1.7 bn it had paid in each of the previous three years . The company employs 10,105 people in the UK . The employees paid # 490m in income tax and National Insurance on their earnings , while BP paid # 110m in employer 's National Insurance contributions . If you add together the corporation tax and production tax paid by BP , together with the National Insurance and income tax paid by its employees and the VAT and fuel excise duty paid by its customers , you get # 5.8 bn , which is about enough to fund the entire budget of the Department for International Development . It is not just the UK economy that is vulnerable to BP 's problems . The company employs 22,800 people in the US . BBC business editor Robert Peston points out that 39 % of the company 's shares are held in the US , about a third of them by individuals rather than institutions . He adds that those US shareholders might not be happy that every time the US president lays into BP , they find themselves a bit poorer . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

BP said the device placed on the well collected 15,800 barrels of oil on Wednesday - slightly up on the 15,010 barrels collected in the previous 24-hour period . New estimates for the oil spill prior to 3 June follow an assessment by a team of scientists put together by the US government and coordinated by the US Geological Survey . `` The lowest estimate that we 're seeing that the scientists think is credible is probably about 20,000 barrels , and the highest that we 're seeing is probably a little over 40,000 , '' said Marcia McNutt , director of the US Geological Survey . The new estimates are staggering and only add to BP 's woes , the BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Florida says . The British oil giant has estimated that up to 19,000 barrels a day was leaking from the ruptured well before they managed to partially contain the spill . Last month , BP was estimating the leak to be the equivalent of just over 5,000 barrels per day . `` This is a nightmare that keeps getting worse every week , '' said Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club , America 's oldest environmental organization . `` We 're finding out more and more information about the extent of the damage ...

US Attorney General Eric Holder has warned that Washington will `` not pay a dime '' for cleaning up and that BP will be held responsible for all damages . And the Speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , has accused BP of a `` lack of integrity '' over its approach to the spill . Ms Pelosi is among a number of US politicians who have suggested that BP should be forced to suspend dividend payments until it is clear the company has enough cash . That has raised concerns in the UK , where BP 's dividends form a crucial part of pension funds for millions of Britons . The sharp criticism from the US has been described by some UK politicians as growing anti-British rhetoric . British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Thursday his government was ready to help BP do all it can to deal with the situation , and understood the US government 's frustration . `` The most important thing is to try to mitigate the effects and get to grips with the problem . It 's something I will discuss with the American president when we next talk , '' he said . On the markets BP 's shares closed down 6 % in London on Thursday , having earlier fallen as much as 12 % .

The Daily Mail editorial expresses disappointment that David Cameron did n't stick up for BP : `` And now surely it 's time for Mr Cameron to tell some of these truths to President Obama , in defense of BP , a vital British company that has been systematically sabotaged by a petty and vengeful American government . '' The Telegraph editorial argues that Mr Cameron needs to be firm with Mr Obama when he talks to him this weekend : `` In his conversation with the President , Mr Cameron needs to make clear that the long-term financial well-being of BP is crucial to the economies of both Britain and the US . Despite Mr Obama 's insistence on associating BP with Britain , it is a multinational company , 40 per cent of whose shareholders are American . Mr Obama is beginning to sound stridently anti-business and anti-oil , neither of which can be in the economic interest of his own country , let alone ours . His impotence in the face of this environmental calamity is understandably frustrating , but this is the time for a cool head and a steady hand . The long-term relationship between Britain and America should not be jeopardised by a presidential response that has been more petulant than statesmanlike . '' `` I do not carry any candles for BP . Nor am I terribly fussed if a US president thinks there are votes to be garnered by stirring up anti-British feeling . The Brits will get over it . It is fair to say that BP has badly fumbled its response to the crisis . If prior negligence is proved , the company must surely stump up billions of dollars in recompense for the havoc wrought by the spill . All that said , surely the leader of the world 's most powerful nation can think of better things to do than to think up new ways to vilify BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward ? '' `` By continually , and repeatedly referring to ` British Petroleum ' the politicos over the water are constantly pushing a subliminal line that it 's not America 's fault . The key here is to refer to another nationality in order to ignore the reality that many of the staff involved before it went wrong are American . To ignore the fact that the company is a merger of one of America 's own oil big boys . '' `` I understand your President keeps referring to British Petroleum , as if the UK was seeking some kind of macabre revenge for the long ago War of Independence which you won rightly and magificently . We share no such feeling . The company concerned is BP . It is a global multinational , with more of its employees and assets in the USA than in the UK . It has global shareholders , with as much of its stock owned by American individuals and Pension funds as owned by British interests . Many of its Directors and senior managers are American . One of its principal forerunners was British Petroleum , but it has changed and grown out of all recognition since those days . It has been a large operator in the USA for many years and has been a pioneer of new and hostile territories for oil exploraiton to seek to meet US demand for petroleum products . In the Gulf it was using an American drilling company and American service companies to seek oil in very deep water .

But when he speaks to Barack Obama this weekend , in a scheduled phone call , the prime minister will be acutely aware of the growing clamor for him to speak up for Britain . Several newspapers , a former Conservative party chairman , Lord Tebbit , and the present Conservative London mayor , Boris Johnson , are all up in arms at the perceived Britain-bashing by the US president . Headlines such as the Daily Mail 's `` Stand Up For Your Country , Mr Cameron '' and its allegations of `` cynical '' attacks by Mr Obama on Britain 's `` flagship company '' capture the mood in sections of the British press and Tory party . Mr Obama 's pithy pledge of finding ass to kick over the environmental disaster , and his pointed references to `` British Petroleum '' , a corporate identity BP has not used in years , have undoubtedly fuelled the impression of deliberate anti-British rhetoric . But as well as the supposed hurt to British feelings , there is also the more material fear that talking the oil giant down will harm its plunging share price still further , exposing British pension funds with investments in the company to potentially serious losses . The British government has tried its best to play the affair with a straight bat so far . Downing Street 's approach has been to try to bypass questions about the tone of comments emanating from the White House , and instead to focus on the practical problems of clean-up . David Cameron 's absence in Afghanistan has meant senior colleagues such as Chancellor George Osborne , Foreign Secretary William Hague and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have had the job of walking the tightrope of appeasing injured British feelings but not falling out with the Americans . Mr Clegg , speaking on a visit to Madrid , said no practical solution to the oil spill could be found in allowing the affair to `` spiral into a tit for tat '' row . Mr Hague said on Thursday there was no evidence of an anti-British tone in anything he had heard , and that dealing with the practical problems of the oil spill was more important than rhetoric that `` any of us may indulge in about it '' . This was a neat way of not denying there may have been anti-British rhetoric , but dismissing it as trivial . Mr Osborne has been deputed to talk to the beleaguered chief executive of BP , Tony Hayward , on behalf of David Cameron - and Downing Street says the Department of Energy stands ready to offer technical assistance to BP , while stressing the spill is BP 's problem to sort out . Ultimately , the relationship with Washington is of utmost importance to the British government , and the tone from Downing Street has consistently been an emollient one of `` we feel America 's pain '' without letting anything become personal . Whether that can be maintained as the oil continues to spew into the ocean will depend as much on President Obama as on David Cameron . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

Pensions expert Ros Altmann : `` I do n't think we should take it out of proportion '' Joanne Segars , chief executive of the NAPF , agreed that the impact on pensions would be `` relatively diluted '' as pension funds invest in many different companies ' stocks and shares . `` The ability of pension funds to pay out pensions to today 's pensioners and tomorrow 's pensioners should n't be affected by this crisis , '' she said .

A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron had told the BP chairman that he was `` frustrated and concerned '' about the environmental damage caused by the spill .

BP placed a containment cap on its damaged oil well earlier this month ; by last week , it was collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day . It is estimated that some 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.7 million gallons -RRB- of oil a day might have been gushing out before the well was capped . On Tuesday , Mr Obama will address the US about the oil spill from the White House in a prime-time televised speech . A presidential aide said he would outline the next steps his administration would be taking over the spill . Mr Obama had previously visited Louisiana on three occasions . In his Monday visit , he is going to the other states affected by the crisis - Alabama , Mississippi and Florida . Mr Obama said the disaster would have a lasting impact on US environmental policy . `` In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9\\/11 , I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , '' he said in the Politico interview . Mr Obama vowed to `` move forward in a bold way in a direction that finally gives us the kind of future-oriented visionary energy policy that we so vitally need and has been absent for so long '' . `` One of the biggest leadership challenges for me going forward is going to be to make sure that we draw the right lessons from this disaster , '' he said . Mr Obama said he could not predict whether the nation would make a complete transition from an oil-based economy within his lifetime , but added that `` now is the time for us to start making that transition and investing in a new way of doing business when it comes to energy '' . `` I have no idea what new energy sources are going to be available , what technologies might drive down the price of renewable energies , '' he said . `` What we can predict is that the availability of fossil fuel is going to be diminishing ; that it 's going to get more expensive to recover ; that there are going to be environmental costs that our children our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to have to bear . '' Attempt to cap oil leak The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed . The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section . First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely-operated shear . This was completed at 1930 CDT on 1 June -LRB- 0030 GMT 2 June -RRB- . The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP . The blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB- ROV -RRB- . After removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface . Latest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is now being captured . BACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Yahoo !

The cost of cleaning up the spillage has risen to $ 1.6 bn -LRB- # 1.1 bn -RRB- . Meanwhile , US lawmakers have accused BP of cutting costs and taking short cuts in the run-up to the explosion that led to the oil spill in the Gulf . The Democratic leaders of the US House Energy and Commerce Committee , Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak , wrote in a letter to BP boss Tony Hayward that the oil giant took shortcuts that `` increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure '' . Mr Hayward is due to appear before the committee on Thursday . BP is also facing a raft of lawsuits , some of which have already been filed . The latest announcement on costs does not include any estimate of potential legal bills . The company 's value has almost halved since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April and sank off the coast of Louisiana , killing 11 workers . Speaking to the House of Commons , Energy Secretary Chris Huhne said that BP `` remains a strong company with exceptionally strong cashflow and has the resources to put the right the damage . '' The BP board will discuss the dividend during a teleconference . No decision is expected to be announced immediately . BP bosses are due to meet President Barack Obama on Wednesday . Mr Obama wants BP to pay money into a ring-fenced fund to compensate those with `` legitimate '' damages claims . The company said on Monday that its response to the incident has so far cost $ 1.6 bn . Much of that is linked to the clean-up operation - but it said it had also paid 26,500 claims totalling $ 62m . Last week , President Obama accused the oil firm of `` nickel and diming '' Gulf residents while planning big dividends for investors . BP 's meeting comes as the president begins a two-day visit to the Gulf Coast to view the damage from the slick . BBC business editor Robert Peston has said it is looking increasingly likely that BP will stop paying dividends to shareholders - worth about # 1.8 bn per quarter - until it can quantify the final bill for the Gulf of Mexico spill and can `` prove to the White House that it can afford those enormous costs '' . The National Association of Pension Funds -LRB- NAPF -RRB- estimates that UK pension funds ' exposure to BP was only about 1.5 % of their total assets , which are worth more than # 800bn .

He told MPs a review of standards had been carried out but with the beginning of exploration in deeper waters west of Shetland , `` we must be vigilant '' . Following the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster , UK regulation had been `` significantly tightened '' , he said . US President Barack Obama likened the spill 's impact to the way the 9\\/11 attacks shaped US security policy . Mr Huhne told MPs an `` urgent review '' of oil and gas industry standards had already been undertaken . `` It 's clear that our safety and environmental regulatory regime is already among the most robust in the world ; the industry 's record in the North Sea is strong , '' he said . All the companies involved in the Deepwater Horizon project , Halliburton , Transocean , Cameron and BP should be subject to investigation '' End Quote Ed Miliband Shadow energy secretary But with deep water drilling planned west of Shetland , Britain had to be vigilant . `` Initial steps are already under way including doubling annual environmental inspections by Decc -LRB- the Department of Energy and Climate Change -RRB- to drilling rigs . '' `` I will review our new and existing procedures as soon as detailed analysis of the factors which caused the incident in the Gulf of Mexico are available , building on the work already begun by the newly formed oil spill prevention and response advisory group . '' He said global deep water production was important during `` our transition to a low-carbon economy '' but the disaster had been an `` environmental wake-up call '' . The spill was a `` stark reminder of the environmental dangers of oil and gas production in ever more difficult areas , '' he said , which highlighted the need to switch to lower carbon technology . The explosion on the Piper Alpha rig had led to an overhaul of British regulation - with licensing and operational regulation split from the health and safety regime . British officials had been discussing this with US counterparts , he added . On BP , he said it was `` hugely regrettable '' that the firm had as yet been unable to stop the spill off the US coast . But he praised its `` strong public commitment to stand by its obligations , to halt the spill and to provide remedy and payment of all legitimate claims '' . I think our regime has been shown to be robust '' End Quote Chris Huhne Energy and Climate Change Secretary BP remained a `` strong company '' which would continue to be `` a major employer and vital investor here and in the United States , '' he went on . `` And in many ways , BP is effectively an Anglo-American company with 39 % of its shares owned in the United States , against 40 % in the United Kingdom . '' He sought to reassure UK pension fund investors amid press speculation about the impact of BP 's troubles on them , saying the company was `` financially sound '' and pension funds holding its shares generally also held a very diverse portfolio of assets . Shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband said he wanted to express `` deep concern '' about the oil spill and said there should be a `` clear and co-ordinated response '' from the US and UK governments . He added : `` All the companies involved in the Deepwater Horizon project , Halliburton , Transocean , Cameron and BP , should be subject to investigation . Finger pointing at BP in particular is not helpful . '' Mr Huhne agreed , saying BP 's interest in the Deepwater Horizon project amounted to 65 % and the rig had been subcontracted from Transocean , `` a very well-known and respected US company '' which was using technology produced in the US . Labor MP Gareth Thomas pointed out that there were 10 Transocean rigs operating in UK waters and suggested they should be subject to an immediate safety review . Mr Huhne said : `` That is precisely why , when we conducted the urgent review of our existing regime , we thought it was appropriate to increase immediately the number of environmental inspectors who can go on to rigs and ensure that the rules and regulations which are set out for safety and environmental safety are properly applied . '' Mr Miliband suggested Britain should look at any lessons learned before starting deep water drilling west of Shetland . But Mr Huhne replied : `` I do n't believe ... that it would be appropriate to stop the drilling going on west of Shetland , precisely because I think our regime has been shown to be robust .

An explosion in 1979 at the Ixtoc I platform , located 80km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- off Mexico 's Gulf Coast , caused the largest ever peacetime oil spill . It took Pemex , Mexico 's state-owned oil company , more than nine months to stop the leak , during which time almost 3.3 million barrels of oil had gushed into the sea . It traveled as far as the Texas shoreline . The fire and collapse of the Ixtoc rig is eerily similar to what happened at Deepwater Horizon : in both cases , the blowout preventer failed to function . Back in 1979 , Pemex tried several methods to contain the oil that were similar to the procedures recently used by BP . They finally managed to stop it by drilling two relief wells . A crucial difference is that the Ixtoc was drilling at a depth of 150ft -LRB- 45m -RRB- , whilst Deepwater blew at 5,000 ft -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the sea . But , as the people of Campeche have learned , blocking the leak is not necessarily the biggest challenge when an oil spill occurs . In the fishing town of Champoton , in the state of Campeche , many people will tell you that the Ixtoc spill marked a turning point in the economy of the area . `` The amount of fish to catch was never the same as before the spill , '' says Pablo Bonastre , a veteran fisherman who still remembers the days after the accident when they would catch fish whose eyes were red and almost popping out . And he vividly recalls the local government giving them `` a pair of boots , a spade and plastic bags '' to help collect the oil from the sea 's surface . In the following months , many fishermen had to find unskilled work on land ; others left town and never returned . The fishermen believe that depleted fish stocks are not just the result of the Ixtoc spill but of pollution caused by the area 's burgeoning oil industry , which has helped make Mexico one of the world 's top 10 oil producers . The wider environmental impact of the Ixtoc oil spill is uncertain . A series of studies have argued that several factors reduced that impact considerably , among them , the high sea temperatures , which helped the oil evaporate , and the sea currents in the area . Traces from the Ixtoc oil spill allegedly still remain on Mexico 's coastline A 1985 report by Mexico 's National Autonomous University concluded that the effect of the spill was limited . The Ixtoc spill , it explains , `` despite being of great proportions did not -LRB- ... -RRB- cause the deadly environmental impact over the diverse communities and elements that make up the Campeche Sound . '' But another study , carried out by Swedish researchers in 1981 , appears to contradict that view . `` The oil from the Ixtoc I blow-out acutely affected the species and ecosystems in the Campeche Bay area through its chemical toxicity -LRB- in the vicinity of the well -RRB- and through its physical properties -LRB- stickiness -RRB- in a larger area offshore and along the coast , '' that study says . Beyond the academic debate , locals are adamant that the most obvious evidence of Ixtoc 's legacy are the black , rock-like formations of solidified oil that can be found in parts of the Campeche coast . Those were not here before the Ixtoc spill , they say . Many in Mexico believe that the Ixtoc episode could not only provide clues to the possible effects of the BP oil slick , but also offer more immediate guidance . At the time of the Ixtoc crisis , Carlos Osornio was the chief offshore drilling engineer for Pemex and was part of the team trying to contain the leak . From those moments of tension and uncertainty he has this advice for the engineers at BP . `` My recommendation would be to build two relief wells , '' he told the BBC . `` It is the only and final solution they have . '' No doubt those efforts to stop the flow of oil will be followed closely by the residents of the Campeche coast . They fear that a busy hurricane season and changing currents could push some of the oil leaking from the BP rig to their shores - bringing with it the painful memories of Ixtoc , 30 years on .

The system here , as in the US , relies on large shareholders to police boardroom behavior and risk-taking . We now know how utterly they have failed in that duty . Most institutions are strangely timid about confrontations with company managements , despite the billions of pounds under their control . '' `` That takes a fundamental restructuring of banking and economic outlook which I think neither the Office of Fiscal Responsibility nor the Future of Banking Commission gets , because of their London-centric outlook . '' In Bloomberg Businessweek , David Bogoslaw writes that `` the tide has shifted with respect to how much thought mainstream investors are giving to environmental , social , and corporate governance '' : `` The common denominator linking BP with these companies is growing clear : They all failed to anticipate risks that could threaten their business foundations . '' , Clive Crook argues that `` British complaints that BP is being ` scapegoated ' will not help reason to prevail '' : `` Imagine that Exxon Mobil had spent weeks dumping 30,000 barrels of oil a day -LRB- the newest estimate , double the previous one : seven Exxon Valdez spills so far and counting -RRB- on the British shoreline , with no end yet in sight .

This is Rivers State , an area abundant in oil and gas . Environmentalists call the Delta the global capital of oil pollution , but unlike the Gulf of Mexico , there are no underwater robots , flotillas of scientists or oil booms here . On 12 May 2009 , Shell 's Bomo manifold blew up , leaking massive amounts of crude . Local people say 39 hectares were contaminated . A second leak - from a derelict oil tap - had already been continuously spilling oil for years . Shell hired a local company to clean up , but the area remains an oil slick . `` It kills our fish , destroys our skin , spoils our streams , we can not drink , '' says Saturday Pirri , a local palm wine tapper . `` I have no livelihood left . '' His father taught him to make palm wine but today the trees yield only a quarter of what they once provided . Kpor is a world away from the Gulf of Mexico . In the Niger Delta , there is little independent monitoring of spills , and the companies themselves disclose virtually no data about their own pollution . But , according to the Nigerian government , there were more than 7,000 spills between 1970 and 2000 . Environmentalists believe spills - large and small - happen at a rate of 300 every year . Site after site visited by the BBC - in both Bayelsa State and Ogoniland - had happened months before , and still not been cleaned up . In May an Exxon Mobil pipeline in Akwa Ibom sprang a leak - one of several spills involving the company . Environmentalists , journalists and local people described oil leaking for days in a massive spill . They say the leak was less than 300 barrels and that it was isolated on the same day . The claims of the oil company , and the scepticism of environmentalists , are a good example of how little clear agreement there is about the size of spills . `` The Gulf of Mexico has drawn the attention of the whole world , '' says Erabanabari Kobah , a local environmentalist . `` Even the president of the United States must go there to see it . The people there get compensation . But here , you must go to court . You can not win against the oil companies in court . ' The oil industry is accused of a sharp double standard in its operations - of taking advantage of Nigeria 's lack of environment law and weak regulation , while observing higher standards of safety and maintenance overseas . `` It is a grave situation , '' says Kingsley Ogundu Chinda , environment commissioner in Rivers State . `` I blame the owners of the facilities . They are economical with the truth . They are not sincere in their practice . They are not sincere with the people . '' He also says the government has failed to force companies to observe the law . The joint ventures operating here are effectively Nigerian companies , operating under Nigerian law . The Bille 2 Awoba Flowstation is guarded by the military Shell , for example , owns only a 30 % stake in SPDC - the Shell Petroleum Development Company . The rest is Nigeria 's national oil company , the NNPC , and smaller stakeholders . The industry certainly has the spotlight - but not all of the power - nor all of the responsibility . It is a dangerous and unpredictable business . Oil workers and oil contractors are regularly kidnapped for ransom . Heavily armed militants blow up pipelines , stealing oil in a process known as `` bunkering '' . Shell says most of the spills are caused by sabotage , and therefore beyond their control . It is impossible to verify . `` We take every precaution that a spill as a result of our operation is kept to an absolute minimum , '' says Mutiu Sunmonu , Shell 's managing director in Nigeria . `` I can tell you that we have been able to achieve that in terms of the spills that are within our control . '' But oil industry insiders also speak of derelict infrastructure . They talk of decades-old pipelines , rusting oil taps , corroding manifolds , and historic underinvestment reaching back decades . We decided to examine flow stations and pipelines for ourselves . `` Getting close is not easy , '' shouts Evangelist Ibinabobo Sanipe , over the roar of the speedboat . As national secretary of the Oil and Gas Host Communities Association , he is traveling with us . Oil companies ' business in Nigeria , and their participation here , is a force for good '' End Quote Mutiu Sunmonu Shell 's managing director `` The military guard this place fiercely , '' he warns . We bounce above the waves towards a column of dark smoke on the horizon , it is the Bille 2 Awoba Flowstation . Before long , a big military vessel warns us to pull over , with our hands in the air . But with just a few jokes and handshakes , the soldiers are smiling and joking . We continue our journey , having paid no bribe , and shown no identification . Closer to the station , orange flames flicker through the trees , and the air is thick with fumes . Another military patrol is just metres away , behind the station , but we 're out of sight . For 25 minutes , we film the roaring gas flares , before two men in a canoe ask us to leave . `` It is very disturbing , '' says Evangelist Sanipe . `` If Shell is serious about stopping sabotage and oil spills , we would not have got so close . '' But protecting oil facilities from attack by armed gangs is the responsibility of the Nigerian military . In the past , spectacular attacks on oil facilities in Nigeria have threatened the country 's energy security , and delivered shocks to the global oil markets . The ease with which we reached the Awoba Flowstation will raise questions over the security of oil facilities . It is clear that the desperate efforts to halt the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the US have prompted many Nigerians to look hard at their own environmental catastrophe . There is a sense of anger , even among those a long way from the Delta . Shell insists it is misplaced . `` I have no regrets , '' insists Mutiu Sunmonu , Shell 's managing director . `` I am convinced that the oil companies ' business in Nigeria , and their participation here , is a force for good .

Oil and gas continue to flow from the pipe and blowout preventer , causing a five mile -LRB- 8km -RRB- oil slick . The blowout preventer is meant to be the ultimate fail safe against pressure surges . Its valves should have closed , shutting off the oil and gas from the reservoir and sealing the well . The initial failure of the blowout preventer , and subsequent efforts to remotely shut it down , result in a constant leak of oil and gas from holes in the bent riser pipe on the seabed and above the BOP . As oil continues to flow into the sea , initial efforts are made on the surface to contain the leak using booms and dispersants . The response grows daily and soon hundreds of vessels are involved , including skimmers , tugs and recovery ships as well as dozens of aircraft and multiple mobile offshore drilling units . 2 May : BP starts drilling the first of two relief wells . The aim is to connect with the original well and then pump in heavy liquid to stem the flow of oil . Drilling for the second starts on 16 May . Both are expected to take two to three months to complete . 5 May : BP successfully stops the flow of oil from the end of the drilling pipe - one of three leak points . Around the same time , a huge containment dome is lowered over the main leak but this fails on 8 May as the dome is blocked by frozen hydrate crystals caused by leaking gas . 16 May : A tube is inserted into the leaking pipe to funnel off leaking oil and gas to a ship on the surface . 26 May : BP starts its `` top kill '' procedure in an attempt to plug the well by pumping mud into the blowout preventer from a vessel on the surface . A manifold system of pipes and valves is connected to the BOP and a drill pipe from the vessel . Pipes from the manifold are attached to the `` choke and kill '' bypass systems inside the blowout preventer . This gives access to the BOP system 's main valves . Heavy mud with a large proportion of clay is pumped into the BOP under high pressure . The aim is to force enough mud into the well to stop it flowing . A `` junk shot '' mixture of materials such as rubber , golf balls and rope is injected in an effort to help block the flow . 29 May : BP announces that the top kill system has failed and the oil spill continues . 2 June : BP starts the next procedure - to lower a cap over the blowout preventer to capture the leaking oil and funnel it to a surface vessel . The riser pipe is cut and removed and the cap is lowered onto the top section of the blowout preventer , known as the lower marine riser package or LMRP . The cap is not a tight fit and oil is still leaking around it , but it does collect about 15,000 barrels of oil a day . 16 June : Engineers open a second route to the surface by connecting the lines used in the top kill procedure to a floating rig called Q4000 . This collects about 10,000 barrels a day . 10 July : The LMRP cap is removed to be replaced with a tightly fitting capping stack , designed to seal the well . 15 July : With the sealing cap fitted , all three rams - or valves - inside are turned off and the flow of oil is stopped for the first time since 20 April . In the following days , tests are conducted to check whether pressure will cause oil to leak from elsewhere in the BOP or well . The tests are successful . Work begins on the next process : a `` static kill '' which involves pumping drilling mud through the blowout preventer into the well and reservoir . 5 August : Engineers follow up the mud with cement , blocking the well . US Government scientists announce the total estimated amount of oil spilt into the Gulf of Mexico is 4.9 million barrels . Work continues on the relief wells . The plan is to use at least one relief well to pump more mud and cement into the main well to totally seal or `` kill '' it . The well can then be abandoned although BP says it will continue clean-up work in the area for `` as long as it takes '' . The cost of cleaning up the oil spillage in the Gulf of Mexico now runs into billions of dollars , according to BP estimates . The company has tried a number of methods to shut down the leak from the damaged oil well - often innovating as subsequent attempts fail . Although some of the methods have been tried and tested at incidents elsewhere in the world , they have not been carried out at such great depth as the Deepwater Horizon leak - 5,000 feet -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the surface .

You can see video from the White House at the top of the page , and analysis from BBC correspondents below , as well as the latest from the blogs , Twitter and e-mails from our readers . 2200 : Our live coverage ends now - but you can keep up with the latest developments here . Thanks very much for joining us . 2159 : Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation tweets : President Obama 's message tonight was the wrong one . We need leadership , not politics . Read The Heritage Foundation 's tweets 2156 : Joshua Green , The Atlantic `` Seizing the moment , '' invoking World War II vets and the moon landing are all well and good , but it rang pretty hollow to me ... For all his praise of the House climate bill and talk about the `` consequences of inaction '' and so forth , not once did he utter the phrase , `` It 's time to put a price on carbon . '' And that suggests to me that this speech was primarily about containing the damage to his administration , and was not the pivot point in the energy debate that many people were hoping for . 2155 : Kedar from India writes : We make BP pay for this damage . Who will pay India for the Bhopal gas tragedy ? 2152 : Taegan Goddard , Political Wire Though Obama called for a `` national mission '' to transition to clean energy , he was vague on what he actually wants to see in a comprehensive energy bill . In doing so , Obama is just another president that has refused to ask Americans for the necessary sacrifice to finally achieve this greater national goal . He missed a golden opportunity . 2150 : Energy politics blogger David Roberts tweets : I feel like , unlike Congress , the public is desperate for purpose and ambition right now . Everything Obama 's doing is ... managerial . Read David Roberts 's tweets 2140 : Daniel K from Philadelphia , US , writes : I think Obama gave a good speech , and it was exactly what we need to hear from a leader about this crisis . 2137 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington When the president speaks from the Oval Office , it 's serious , and it 's personal . This was Barack Obama attempting to show that he is now in charge of dealing with the worst environmental disaster in US history . He spoke in lofty terms about moving away from fossil fuels , embracing a clean-energy future and shaping the country 's destiny . But most Americans just want the leak to stop and that , two months after it began , remains a distant prospect . 2135 : Bpdeadbirds uses data from a Deepwater Horizon Response report to provide updates on the total number of animals that have died apparently due to the spill . It tweets : `` Today 's BP death tally : 770 birds , 341 sea turtles , 41 mammals . '' Read Bpdeadbirds 's tweets 2132 : This just in : The White House announces President Obama will address reporters in the Rose Garden following his meeting with BP execs . We were n't expecting another appearance : does that mean the White House is unhappy with how tonight 's speech has been received ? 2130 : You can read the full speech here . 2125 : Ezra Klein , WashingtonPost.com The optimistic take , at least for environmentalists , is that this is the language and approach Obama uses when he really means to legislate . The pessimistic take is that Obama shied away from clearly describing the problem , did not endorse specific legislation , did not set benchmarks , and chose poll-tested language rather than a sharper case that might persuade sceptics . 2115 : Linda R Friar from Pacific Palisades , California , US , writes : Obama needs to deal more effectively with the current environmental disaster reaching our shores , and stop campaigning about energy proposals that at the moment are irrelevant . 2104 : That 's it for President Obama 's first address to the nation from the Oval Office and Robert Gibbs 's live question session . But you can find more quickfire analysis and reaction brought to you here for the next hour . 2103 : Mr Gibbs ends the live question session talking about the long-term need to restore the coastline along the Gulf . He 'll be taking more questions from the public tomorrow . 2102 : Michael Whitney , firedoglake Basically , Obama offered no specifics on how to bring some life to the recovery effort , used BP 's unfounded statistics to promise about the cleanup , and again offered no specifics for what he will do to help the people of the Gulf . There 's a whole lot of pretty sentiments and references to maritime tradition , but nothing about what the administration will do differently . 2059 : Media critic Howard Kurtz tweets : On Fox , Palin rips Obama speech , says if he does n't admit oil needs `` we will be brought to our knees , '' `` bowing '' to Saudis and Venezuelans . Read Howard Kurtz 's tweets 2056 : Mr Gibbs says that the government needs to end its subsidies for big oil , but it does n't look like he 'll get much co-operation from Congress on that front . Today , the Senate voted against closing tax loopholes that would have resulted in $ 35bn in taxes from oil companies . 2055 : M2ab tweets : Obama 's speech sounded like his typical ` Hope ' speech . Read M2ab 's tweets 2055 : Yikes ! Technical hitches on the White House live page . 2052 : Mr Gibbs appears to be sticking closely to his unofficial job description : do n't overshadow your boss and do n't make news unintentionally . He has referred several times to his son , and his hopes for a cleaner future for him . 2051 : Chris Cillizza , The Fix , WashingtonPost.com Obama began the speech by drawing an overt comparison between the war against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and the `` oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens '' . He repeatedly referred back to military terms - `` battle '' and `` siege '' to name two - to frame the challenge before the country , and even referenced the build-up of material in the early stages of World War II as evidence of the American people 's ability to conquer seemingly impossible challenges . The goal of all that war talk ? To unify the country behind the government 's attempts to solve the problem . 2050 : Tiina from Helsinki , Finland , writes : The US has to take serious and quick action on environmental issues . They must join global efforts - they have too much influence worldwide to stay behind . 2049 : Mr Gibbs says he knows Mr Obama well and assures viewers that Mr Obama is not going to be the next in a long line of presidents who just walks up to Capitol Hill and says he is going to do something about America 's dependence on foreign oil . He 's going to do something . Mr Gibbs calls on Congress to take bold steps to assist the president . 2048 : Mr Gibbs is careful to distinguish between `` BP 's oil spill '' and BP 's response , and the response of the administration . 2043 : Daniel Foster , The Corner , National Review Online I have to admit I was somewhat surprised to see President Obama use his first Oval Office address to repeat populist platitudes about `` making BP pay '' and hit the bullet points , for the umpteenth time , of the Democrats ' ill-advised cap-and-trade scheme . Oval addresses are best reserved for wars and resignations . 2043 : Mr Gibbs says he will not let BP dictate media access to the Deepwater Horizon site . 2042 : In case you are wondering , the purple bracelet Mr Gibbs is wearing is for the nine-year-old daughter of friends of his who is battling cancer . 2042 : Donna Wills from Largo in Florida , US , writes : Please help us , this is all some people here know . Florida has been my home for thirty years and now it is slowly dying . 2034 : At several points in his presidency , Mr Obama has used a speech to change the conversation . Remember the speech on race prompted by the Rev Wright videos ? Remember the address to Congress about healthcare ? Do you think he used his oratorical skills to good effect tonight ? 2030 : HellNoYouDidnt tweets : This speech is the death nail for Democrats . Tea Partiers , Republicans and Independents , Do n't screw this one up ! Read HellNoYouDidnt 's tweets 2029 : Wonkette We planned to do liveblogging on this historic night of Barack Obama 's first televised speech from the Oval Office , but it went so quick ! Still , we can live-blog whatever nonsense people say on the teevee in response , right ? 2025 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington It 's all about Americans shaping their own destiny . The president has made a lofty appeal to American idealism . It wo n't be universally welcomed at a time when Americans are mostly worried about the more pressing need simply to stop the leak . 2025 : We 're now waiting for Press Secretary Robert Gibbs to answer questions from members of the public , who have made their submissions via YouTube . You can watch Mr Gibbs here . 2024 : RaklGps tweets : Mr President , the engineers at NASA are indeed the innovative types we need . Does this mean you will refund NASA ? Read RaklGps 's tweets 2023 : RL Miller tweets : Obama is n't making the connection between fossil fuels and climate change . Biggest missed opportunity ever . Read RL Miller 's tweets 2022 : Jed Lewison , Daily Kos Turns out the President does n't sound quite as eager to lift the moratorium as Drill , Bobby , Drill -LRB- Louisiana Governor Bobby -RRB- Jindal would like . 2020 : President Obama ends his speech on an optimistic note , saying that Americans will pray that a hand may guide them through the storm towards a brighter day . 2019 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington The president says the Minerals Management Service had `` over the last decade '' become `` emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility '' . Mr Obama is perhaps too subtle to blame the Bush administration by name for his present predicament , but this is clearly a jab at his predecessor . 2018 : It 's rare for Mr Obama to talk about God , but tonight he talked about faith several times , including this anecdote : `` As a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition , ` The blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers . The blessing is that He is with us always . ' '' 2018 : TreeHugger tweets : Obama , no offshore drilling can be absolutely safe . 6 month moratorium is nice , but why continue issuing leases ? Read TreeHugger 's tweets 2017 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington The president says that he will `` inform '' the head of BP that `` he is to set aside whatever resources are required '' to compensate affected individuals and businesses . He wants to make sure that tomorrow 's encounter at the White House is seen as an occasion in which he lays down the law . That he , not BP , is in charge . 2017 : Is the US Senate listening to this message , because it 's clear who President Obama is talking to here : `` The one approach I will not accept is inaction . The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is too big and too difficult to meet '' . 2016 : Obama 's rhetoric in this section is very reminiscent of his campaign 2008 speeches . He says : `` The transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of good , middle-class jobs - but only if we accelerate that transition . Only if we seize the moment . And only if we rally together and act as one nation . '' 2013 : President Obama takes a passionate tone , asserting that the `` the time to embrace a clean energy future is now '' . Emphasis on the `` now '' . 2013 : Now , President Obama reflects President Johnson 's same concerns three decades ago : `` Time and again , the path forward has been blocked - not only by oil industry lobbyists , but also by a lack of political courage and candor . '' 2011 : Mark Knoller from CBS News tweets : Obama concedes that no matter how effective our response becomes , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . Read Mark Knoller 's tweets 2011 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington At a time when the president and his administration face criticism over the speed and scale of the federal response , the president quickly sets out the extent of what he calls `` the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation 's history '' , while admitting that `` there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done '' . 2010 : President Obama takes his first shot at his Republican opponents , saying that the mismanagement of the Minerals Management Service is `` emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility - a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves '' . 2009 : President Obama says an independent third party will adjudicate claims for compensation , but gives very few details about how that process will work . Expect Press Secretary Gibbs to be bombarded with questions about that in the coming days . 2007 : President Obama 's tone is firm but calm and even . This is no Lyndon Johnson `` bullhorn '' moment , but he 's not echoing Jimmy Carter 's `` malaise '' themes either . It seems he 's doing his best to be reassuring . Perhaps the best analogy is President Clinton ? 2007 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington `` Unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , '' the president says . This is not his Katrina . 2005 : Mr Obama uses tough language with regard to BP , saying he will `` make them pay '' . But he does n't dwell on BP , moving on to more positive news about the clean-up effort . 2003 : Mr Obama opens by chronicling his response to the spill - perhaps an attempt to instil confidence in his management style ? 2001 : Following the speech , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs will answer questions from the public . For more details go to the White House website . 1957 : Some interesting poll numbers provide context for tonight : according to Gallup , 59 % of Americans believe BP should pay for damages and lost wages , even if it forces the company into bankruptcy . And 71 % do n't think President Obama has been tough enough on BP . 1955 : Although Mr Obama is expected to have harsh words for BP tonight , Walter Shapiro of Politics Daily says : `` An Oval Office address is too rare and too important a presidential event to waste time scoring cheap political points at the expense of BP . '' 1952 : The oil executives received a thorough grilling on Capitol Hill today , but later , senators voted 35-61 against stripping big oil companies of $ 35bn in tax breaks they 'll receive over the next 10 years . Are members of Congress all talk and no action ? 1947 : One more big question : will Mr Obama call for Congress to put a price on carbon ? 1945 : Lawrence Grenier from Corpus Christi in Texas , US , writes : As our neighbors to the east of us struggle with the now imminent destruction of their wetlands , marshes and beaches , I hope the armchair experts realize that the environment is but one factor to be reckoned with . This tragedy will come at an astronomical financial cost as well . Gulf coast resorts and local business will lose , pensioners of BP will lose and , without any defense , migratory birds , fish , mammals will lose their habitats . 1945 : Questions continued : How exactly will Mr Obama compel BP to create an escrow account to compensate individuals and businesses affected by the spill ? What are your thoughts ? 1939 : Ed Hornick , AC360 , CNN President Obama must angle his address to the nation on the gulf oil disaster as more of a `` warlike update '' than the kind of addresses given by past presidents on national tragedies , a top presidential historian said . `` This is going to be a different kind of president address ... like we 're in the middle of the war and he 's giving an update on the war on the Gulf , '' said Douglas Brinkley , a professor of history at Rice University . 1938 : Brian Woodahl from Indianapolis , US , writes : I find it unacceptable that Barack Obama finds it reasonable to bash BP . Most of this is done to enhance his political posturing in light of the upcoming November elections . 1937 : Big questions for tonight : what will Mr Obama say about the fate of deepwater offshore drilling in the US , especially given how much coastal communities are already hurting from the current moratorium ? 1936 : You can send us your thoughts on Mr Obama 's speech here . 1930 : The BBC 's Steve Kingstone in Washington Barack Obama will use his prime-time address to reassure the American public that he understands the scale of the challenge and is ready to hold BP to account . He will reiterate his administration 's principal demand : that BP pay into an independently-administered account to compensate those affected by the spill . 1928 : White House staffers are hoping for tonight to be an `` inflection point '' , a moment where confidence in the administration 's ability to handle the crisis is restored . What do you think ? 1926 : White House officials have indicated that Mr Obama will use the opportunity to present his vision for America 's energy future , and use his bully pulpit to pressure Congress to act . 1917 : The BBC 's David Willis in Washington A recovery czar is to be appointed . President Obama is expected to talk about that person . Also , prevention is expected to be a part of his speech ... On the crucial aspects of the discussions with BP , for example whether or not BP has agreed to suspend the dividend , we will probably have to wait until tomorrow . 1914 : We also expect Mr Obama to announce regulatory changes to help prevent future spills . This will probably include some reorganisation of the Minerals Management Service , which was , prior to this spill , the government agency charged with overseeing oil drilling . Administration officials indicated Mr Obama would call for a body that acts as a `` watchdog not a partner '' of the oil industry . 1910 : According to administration officials , we can expect the president to outline plans for the ongoing clean-up effort , as well as longer term plans to restore the Gulf . Look for the area to be described as having `` unique beauty and bounty '' . 1905 : Welcome to our live coverage of President Barack Obama 's first Oval Office address to the nation . On the agenda tonight : oil , oil and a bit more oil . The president is n't just battling the worst environmental disaster in the nation 's history , he 's trying to combat the growing perception that his response to the BP spill has been inadequate . Tonight we 'll be updating this page with up-to-the-minute news , analysis from our correspondents , some of your emails , and rounding up the best of blogs and tweets .

And I 'm very curious what legal authority he 's going to force BP to actually pay up , let alone pay into an escrow fund that they do n't control .

As if the rig etc. were at fault and not the people making the decision regarding the well . In any case , the sentiment is not anti-British , it is anti BP . BP is and criminally negligent now and have been many times in the past and should pay a heavy , heavy price for it . They should be dissolveed entirely . Simply because Great Britain et al have tied their welfare state to this monster does not make it immune to the laws of the free market . It is NOT the state , it is a company .

Beyond the defensive national hysteria in Britain and the media generated wailing in the USA , this is an industrial accident . It 's not an evil , intentional act and it 's a rare occurance in a generally safe and essential industry . And it 's primarily up to that industry to find a solution and make good the damaage . There is nothing to suggest `` Government '' and certainly Mr. Obama can do any better than BP is . What is need is less postering by politicians . And I do wish you British would just shut up and butt out . . if BP is , as you tediously keep reminding us , not a British company , why this pathological interest in an accident by an multinational oil company in American waters ? At 02:18 am on 16 Jun 2010 , Jaker wrote : I sent the below comment to the BBC on Sunday night , so I was pretty much right on what he would say . But I doubt if they can clean up this mess in the time he has said in his speech to a couple of weeks or days . There is a hurricane season about to start , the oil spill is getting worse not better , no one knows who 's in charge of the clean-up effort , he has said he may use the navy & military , but they have n't the expertise or the equipment to tackle this mammoth task . And this speech was n't the time to talk of Green technology for that 's not going to happen for years ... the people of the Gulf coast need things done to stop the spill immediately , or as soon as possible , but it wo n't be in the time the President said . And he talked a lot comparing it to war & that BP were kind of `` Al-Qaeda 's '' in this war , -LRB- literally speaking -RRB- & maybe for the people whose livlihoods are threatened , especially fishermen , it feels that way . One thing is for sure is that same victims do not trust BP as far as they could throw them & I do n't blame them . This tragedy is going to last for years at least 10 to 15 & President Obama will be probably gone from office in eight years ... but if this is not rightly taken care of with the President seen to be tackling it seriously then he 'll be packing his bags in 2012\\/2013 . At this moment in time , I 'd hate to be in his shoes because he has so much on his plate as regards the economy , foreign affairs problems , home grown & foreign terrorism , Iraq , Afghanistan , Iran & North Korea etc. but this problem in his own neck of the woods -LRB- or sea -RRB- to be more specific may be his downfall in the popular stakes if he does n't get it sorted , without making BP completely broke . But people in the Gulf will certainly be broke if BP does n't pay out paments fairly , & pay same as soon as possible . BP ... your die could be nearly cast . BP 's Tony Hayward has n't been very honest with the US media & he wo n't even give interviews directly with any of the big broadcasters , so the media in the US are really going for BP in a big way & they are pressurizing the Federal Government to act harshly against BP . BP are no angels in the debacle when they would n't allow scientists to study video of the daily output for analysis & wo n't even pay minimum compensation to businesses that are\\/have been ruined by the spill , or at least are delaying as long as they can the process . Not to talk of the environment that will take at least ten to fifteen years to put right ... & all the fixes have n't gone in any way to lessen the damage or to prevent the environment disaster spreading to a greater magnitude , in fact they 've made things worse . So President Obama is in a Catch-22 conundrum ... his country is America & he has to do good by it 's citizens . He will be going on National TV next week to tell the American people what he is going to do at this stage of this catastrophe to tell them how bad it is & is going to get after having taken advise from expert 's in the industry & from Professor 's of Engineering & Marine & Oceanography Science . The main thing of this debacle is that there are human beings in the middle of it through no fault of their own that are without a living after the leak\\/fallout . They are angry that now after the 20th of April explosion & its now June that nothing is solved or improving as regards the spill . They are angry that BP is not being honest with them or has n't been since the first day being honest about the true amount of oil leaking & is playing about with offering an advance of conpensatiion that they promised to affected businesses over the last two weeks . There will be inquirys & law suits a plenty now getting ready to hit the courts & BP may be forced now from the time the President speaks to pass over to the Federal government an x-amount of money to a fund for US government officials to pay out to sincere victims of this tragedy . Will Britain\\/US relations suffer ... most likely not because BP promised all along that they would do everything in it 's power to sort it out . It has failed & failed miserbly ... & Tony Hayward could have been more forthright with the people mostly caugt up in its consequences . of course Transocean will be caught up in the court battles as well as another party responsible for the spill . BP has a bad record over a long period as regards safety , the proof is there if one researches same , but all that would fill a book . So yes , BP has a massive problem on it 's hands & it 's getting worse by the day ... but one thing that would help greatly is if Tony Hayward would act & talk like he is really concerned for the two most important things in this tragedy , the environment & especially the human beings caught up in it . Then & only then can he get his LIFE that he craves so much with his lifestyle back . One truth though for you Tony is , the road back home is going to take some time .

Potentially if more were to be done to switch from oil to NG the US could avoid buying any foreign oil - except canadian which is not considered foreign in this context . So two objectives could be achieved , a substantial improvement in the balance of payment on international trade , and the greater security provided by home grown energy . While I will agree with those that want to switch to ` green ' energy sources such as wind and solar etc. , the reality is that such alternatives will take a long time to develop in meaningful quantities , whereas NG can be available in huge quantities almost immediately . NG could therefore bridge the gap for as many years as it might take to develop other clean energy sources . As to what Obama should do about BP I think it would be wise to cooperate with them as much as possible since they seem willing to take on more costs than can be enforced under existing legislation for clean up . Frankly I blame lax oversight by regulators as much if not more than the oil companies who are not going to spend on backup systems unless forced to do so .

Because so many of his own constituents have hypocritically invested in a company that has 1 -RRB- been involved in the oil business for eons 2 -RRB- has been cited for negligent practices all over the world -LRB- this is the latest and worst of FOUR accidents in the U.S. over the past ten years -RRB- & 3 -RRB- it is a slap in the face to the eleven men who died and the thousands more families that have lost all income from this , not to mention a situation that could REALLY make any working relationship he may hope to build with Obama difficult -LRB- he is due to fly here soon , if I am not mistaken . -RRB- BP had the accident and spilled the oil . But surely the blame ca n't be all theirs . The US 's demand for oil and it 's loathing of having to buy it from abroad ; and it 's relaxation of off-shore drilling , has to share part of the blame . When the leak was first announced , BP said 1,000 barrels a day were being leaked . Any fool with a knowledge of calculus knows that can not be right by looking at the footage ; no , strike that , just any plain old fool could tell you that sludge can not be just 1,000 barrels !! Secondly , the relaxation of offshore drilling law is a legacy of the much hated Bush presidency , which upon closer inspection , was only partly successful : remember , Bush and his cronies wanted to open up an oil pipeline in an Alaskan wildlife refuge , and other members of his party want -LRB- ed -RRB- to begin drilling in places like Virginia , in other locations in Alaska -LRB- Palin -RRB- and in California -LRB- they have stated as such as recently as April . -RRB- In other words , we should be counting our lucky stars that this was not WORSE . They use 25 % of the worlds oil resources and see nothing wrong in that . If the demand was not there then these high risk deep drilling operations would not happen . Actually , the figure is closer to 20 % . Furthermore , if I were you , I would be much more worried about India and China in this department : each has about four times the population of the United States . Each has shown exponential growth over the past years , both in eligible drivers and in persons who can afford a car , not to mention the fact that most of the world 's untapped oil reserves sit in ASIA . The appetite for material resources in each nation will not diminish with time , but grow -LRB- China surpassed the U.S. for oil consumption in 2006 ; India likely will do the same this decade , pushing the US to third place . -RRB- Furthermore , if I am not mistaken , the UK has interests in the North Sea and the EU itself buys a lot of its oil from Gazprom -LRB- Russia -RRB- both of which utilize deep sea drilling and have done so for a long time . Do you see anything wrong with supporting Russian oligarchs or would you rather keep whingeing about BP ? . . A US company , figures vary but the likely death toll is around 15,000 . Half a million people were exposed to poison gas and hundreds of tons of toxic chemicals still remain there abandoned , leaking into the water system and still making people ill . 25 years ago a US multinational gas company poisoned thousands of Indians and should have been raked across the coals . That much is agreed upon . However , in twenty years the Indian government has had ample opportunity to bring the CEO who caused the disaster to justice . -LRB- Last I checked , extradition treaties were still in effect . -RRB- Twenty-five years and multiple prime ministers later , not a single one has brought the issue to the attention of the Justice Department or made it into a dealbraking diplomatic issue . - Because if they did they would expose their own corruption and mishandling of Bhopal , first of all , and secondly they would touch upon India 's current , extreme , HOMEGROWN problems with industrialization and lax environmental laws . If Manmohan Singh wishes to use the BP disaster as an opportunity to clear up Bhopal with Obama , I doubt the White House or the American people shall object as those poor people deserve some solace ... but the costs may sadly outweigh the benefits for Singh . It is interesting that the facts of the Bhopal case have been available for 25 years ... and only now at this time does the British media take an interest -LRB- shocking even , given the longstanding immigration patterns from India to the UK . -RRB- Trolling around the internet , I have found at least half a dozen British publications spinning and spitting venom at Barack Obama and Congress because they dared call BP `` British Petroleum '' -LRB- funny how that works when corporate headquarters , are , were , and remain , in London . -RRB- Meanwhile , the people of the Gulf Coast just want to stop sobbing over their lost jobs , over their lost husbands , over the dead dolphins and pelicans that wash ashore , and want BP to stop making promises and start actually ACTING upon them -LRB- facts : they wo n't let people volunteer at the beach with the cleanup because they do not want photos snapped of people in HAZMAT suits and they have refused to answer any questions from ANYONE . -RRB- If the people of the UK have so much hate in their hearts that they would deign it a good thing that a second Bhopal may be in the works here , or are more concerned with the returns they will get on BP shares than the sight of a dying ecosystem , then I pity their myopia . Fourth of July is in about 3 weeks . -LRB- Snorting derisively -RRB- Happy Birthday America . IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE MOST GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL . Deal with the situation as it be .

Ranting and raving oil executives because they are adhering to their legal rights is not pretty . Change the law for the next time not retrospectively to fit the need now ! President Obama and the US Govt and its people are right to pressure the people responsible for this accident , which I believe BP has now . As for BP executives ` lying ' , well lets not pretend here that this is something that BP Execs do alone , I am certain that all very large corporates , including all those US based ones , are filled with lies and deceit , a mentality brought about mostly by absolute greed for both power and money , and many people around the world pay for such attitudes on a daily basis whilst those of us ` at home ' either simply do not know about the havoc wreaked by some of our companies\\/corporations or do not care and of course some actively try to change their own ways . Seems to me that the US suffers from a social issue when such things occur , that is borne from their sue and screw mentality , and this attitude seems rather prevalent right now . I believe they have in fact handled this whole affair very very badly , I say this because as I first stated no one would argue that ultimately BP has a responsibility , but the US have become aggressive and arrogant and overly moralizing here and I believe some members of their own hierarchy see this as an opportunity to get some quick cash for cheap at very little effort and are applying pressure in very specific places and are also misleading people about some of the realities of what as occurred here . Let not also forget here that the US Govt -LRB- I know many US citizens are though -RRB- are n't to really ` Eco Friendly ' in general , so screaming about the environment does n't really cut it for the rest of the world , one poster from another HYS mentioned that California has better emission laws than the UK , yeah I agree that may well be true in general , but then you need them do n't you , as ` my car will go 55 miles on a gallon petrol and your does 12 miles on a gallon ... ' , does n't sound like them laws are so good to me after all . And I believe the US have still failed to ratify numerous ` eco ' based policies set out and and agree upon by international bodies . So lets not pretend they actually care about the environment at large , except of course when its their own land . I think there are 2 things that have become more apparent in regard to this situation , first , we as a whole race in general need to wake up and accept that any form of activity poses risks and that its not simply enough to point fingers and lay blame , we all need to accept we are all tied together and in part this accident occurred because of the pressure to supply oil and therefore we all have a role to play . Second , I feel that the US are pushing the rest of us too far , globally they are very good at pointing out responsibility to others , pointing fingers of blame and making demands , often quite unreasonable ones , yet almost always fail to accept their own responsibility , almost always fail to compensate and pay fully for the issues and problems they have cause other nations , they almost always put them selves first at all costs irrelevant of whether that choice is morally and ethically sound and almost always fail to understand why it is that so many people have a problem with their general attitude on the international stage . Finally , I would suggest to the US that they are setting a precedent here , and this is of course their prerogative but I think they should take heed ; the next time they cause or are involved in a major issue globally , caused either by their business or political activities , they should be nailed to the floor after witnessing their behavior over this episode .

How much on regulation & inspection of safety devices ? Should we not have an industry-wide insurance for such accidents ? If the result of the BP oil spill is that BP gets bought by another company , then instead of two independent companies we will have one much bigger one . Not good for safety .

Mouthy Americans are a fact of life unfortunately , but they never focus on their own faults -LRB- like the fact there is drilling in the Gulf in the first place is because the USA that uses by far the most oil of any nation and wants it 's cheap gas -RRB- . It 's always someone else 's fault . -LRB- not that BP is n't partly responsible here , of course -RRB- . Why no big fuss over the two US companies that are also massively at fault ?

BP 's US chief Lamar McKay and four other oil bosses gave evidence amid accusations BP took shortcuts . President Barack Obama is to make a TV address later from the White House . He will use the prime-time speech , at 2000 -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- , to outline the next steps his administration will take against the spill . Those are reported to include new steps to restore the Gulf Coast ecosystem and explicit demands to ensure BP fully compensates those affected . The speech will be delivered from the Oval Office , a setting reserved for the most sombre and important moments in US national life . Speaking in Florida before returning to Washington at the end of a two-day trip to the affected region , he said the government would not abandon those affected . `` I am with you , my administration is with you for the long haul to make sure BP pays for the damage it has caused , '' Mr Obama said . Oil has been spewing into the Gulf of Mexico since a drilling rig leased by BP exploded on 20 April with the loss of 11 lives and sank two days later . A cap placed by BP on the damaged oil well earlier this month is now said to be collecting about 15,000 barrels daily . But US government and independent scientists now estimate that the most likely flow rate of oil is between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day - a sharp increase on the estimate of a week ago . The operation suffered a setback on Tuesday when a lightning strike sparked a fire on board a vessel collecting oil , forcing BP to suspend operations temporarily . Fitch Ratings , one of the three big credit rating agencies , has downgraded BP by six notches , from AA to BBB . The move means Fitch is less confident of BP 's ability to repay its debts following the huge clean-up and legal costs the company is expected to rack up as a result of the spill . Also on Tuesday , Mr Obama named Michael Bromwich as the new head of the federal agency in charge of oil and gas development , the White House . Opening the congressional hearing , Henry Waxman , joint chairman of the full House energy committee , took a tough line , declaring that the major oil firms were `` no better prepared to deal with a major oil spill than BP '' . He called the five firms ' responses `` cookie-cutter '' plans and `` paper exercises '' , adding : `` BP failed miserably when faced with a real leak and one has to wonder whether ... -LRB- the others -RRB- would do any better . '' Mark Mardell BBC News , Washington The president 's real problem is whether he has gripped this crisis hard enough from the start `` This addiction is fouling our beaches , polluting our atmosphere and undermining our national security , '' said Mr Waxman . However , Texas lawmaker Michael Burgess , a Republican , accused Democrats of using the oil spill as a cover to propose climate change and energy legislation that would lead to over-regulation and higher taxes . And the five oilmen called to give evidence - the bosses of Shell , Chevron , ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips as well as BP America - all told the committee of their corporate commitment to safety . `` We do not proceed with operations if we can not do so safely , '' ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson said . While the theme of Tuesday 's hearing is deepwater drilling in general , BP chief executive Tony Hayward will face a separate House hearing on Thursday devoted to the Deepwater Horizon disaster . Mr Waxman and fellow committee member Bart Stupak sent Mr Hayward a letter on Sunday in which they set out technical questions they expect him to answer . The letter quotes internal communications between BP engineers before the disaster in which the site is described as a `` nightmare well '' . At issue were the choice for the design of the well , preparations for and tests of the cement job , and assurances that the well was properly sealed on the top . The drilling rig exploded and sank in the Gulf , causing 11 deaths Among other things , BP apparently rejected advice of a sub-contractor , Halliburton , in preparing for a cementing job to close up the well . BP rejected Halliburton 's recommendation to use 21 centralisers to make sure the casing ran down the center of the well bore . Instead , BP used six . In an e-mail on 16 April , a BP official involved in the decisions explained : `` It will take 10 hours to install them . I do not like this . '' Later on the same day , another official recognized the risks of proceeding with insufficient centralisers but added : `` Who cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine . '' `` It appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk , '' the congressmen write . `` If this is what happened , BP 's carelessness and complacency have inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants , and the workers on the rig , '' they say .

The oil giant 's rating has been cut by six notches , from AA to BBB . The move means Fitch is less confident of BP 's ability to repay its debts following the huge clean-up and legal costs the company is expected to rack up as a result of the spill . Fitch expressed concerns about `` BP 's fundamental financial flexibility '' . The incident has so far cost BP $ 1.6 bn , the energy giant said on Monday . Fitch said it expected BP to face greater costs than previously thought in relation to the oil spill , and these liabilities might have to be met immediately or soon , rather than spread over time . Nils Blythe BBC business correspondent This is not the first time since the Deepwater Horizon disaster that BP 's credit rating has been cut . But the downgrade by Fitch is unusually sharp . One of the reasons for the downgrade is US political pressure for the company to set aside more than # 13bn against the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . BP currently has nearly # 3.5 bn of cash and # 7bn of unused banking facilities . With a high world oil price the company is also generating new funds all the time . So even the colossal sums currently being talked about by US lawmakers may not be beyond BP 's means . BP bosses are due to meet President Barack Obama on Wednesday . Mr Obama wants BP to pay billions of dollars into a ring-fenced fund to compensate those with `` legitimate '' damages claims - which is expected to run into many billions of dollars . `` The scale of today 's rating action has been partly driven by the increased risk that the balance between long-term and near-term cost payments may now be skewed much more heavily toward the near-term than previously anticipated , '' Fitch said in a statement . The downgrade means that BP may find it more expensive to borrow money from investors , but analysts suggested the immediate impact on the company would be small . David Stedman , oil analyst at Daiwa Securities , said the downgrade would have a `` relatively limited '' effect in the short term , as BP does not rely heavily on borrowing . Explaining its decision to downgrade , Fitch added that the volume of oil being lost was higher than had previously been reported , increasing the fines BP would have to pay to the US government . Moreover , the immediate clean-up costs were also higher than it had previously forecast - ranging between $ 3bn and $ 6bn . Longer-term legal costs will be subject to lengthy court proceedings , Fitch said , with a large amount likely to be payable over many years . Fitch also said it would be `` surprised '' if BP did not suspend dividend payments to shareholders while the financial impact of the oil spill remained so unclear . BP has so far sought to reassure major shareholders that dividends will be paid as normal .

US scientists issued a figure of 35,000-60 ,000 barrels -LRB- 1.5-2 .5 million gallons -RRB- per day on 15 June . The figure was accepted by US Energy Secretary Steven Chu as `` a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil '' . By contrast , an estimate announced by US officials on 26 April put the flow at just 1,000 barrels per day . That figure was later revised to 5,000 barrels . Then it was 12,000-19 ,000 , then 20,000-40 ,000 . Why does the flow rate keep rising ? Normally the flow from a well is measured on a rig but the flow meters on the Deepwater Horizon were destroyed along with the rig in the explosion . The 15 June estimate is based partially on data gathered from pressure meters placed on the sea-bed on BP 's containment cap , which is collecting some of the oil . Another method scientists have used to measure the flow is to combine data from satellite photos of the slick on the sea surface with estimates of the oil 's thickness . But the reliability of this approach depends partly on how much oil has reached the surface , says Geoffrey Maitland , professor of energy engineering at Imperial College , London . Experts in fluid mechanics have been tracking particles coming out of the broken riser pipe and measuring their velocity . They have been refining their models of the flow based on the levels of oil , gas and solid particles coming from the well . Other estimates are based on video from the downhole of the well . A team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US is also using acoustic techniques to measure flow rates . How much oil is being collected by BP ? BP says the containment cap -LRB- the lower marine riser package , or LMRP -RRB- it placed on the well 's damaged blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- on 3 June is collecting about 15,000 barrels a day , piping it up to a ship on the surface . Even if the amount of oil escaping is the low-end figure of 35,000 barrels , that leaves 20,000 leaking into the sea daily . The British company was due , as of mid-June , to start up a second containment system -LRB- SCS -RRB- that would increase collection to 20,000-28 ,000 barrels a day . The SCS is meant to take oil and gas from the BOP 's choke line through a separate riser pipe to another vessel on the surface , where the fuels will be burnt off . The company plans to be able to handle 80,000 barrels of escaped oil per day by mid-July . BP `` under-estimated the flow rate '' and `` over-estimated their ability to fight against that flow rate '' , says Ian MacDonald , professor of oceanography at Florida State University . He told the BBC : `` This was perhaps a fatal miscalculation ... with the result that this crisis has continued much longer , with much greater release of oil than would have been necessary had they -LRB- BP -RRB- made much more accurate flow rates at the very start . '' How accurate are the latest measurements ? It is very difficult to say because the models are constantly being revised and combined with observation . The main plume of oil is being treated with dispersants and surfactants , wetting agents which lower the surface tension of the oil so it can mix with the water . These make an emulsion which brings the oil more quickly to the surface , where it can be scooped up by collection vessels . There are concerns that some of the oil is forming separate , smaller plumes below the surface , Professor Maitland says . This may make it more difficult to estimate the total size of the spill . Not all the oil has surfaced yet , but it will eventually , because oil is lighter than water . The uncertainty in measuring the total size of the spill is harming BP , Professor Maitland warns . `` It depletes confidence that BP have complete control of what is going on and their ability to collect the oil or cap it eventually .

The firm said it was looking forward to Wednesday 's meeting `` for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals '' .

Paul Adams BBC News , Washington When the president speaks from the Oval Office , it is serious , and it is personal . This was Barack Obama attempting to show that he is now in charge of dealing with the worst environmental disaster in US history . He pledged that BP would pay for the damage ; that the Gulf Coast would be restored ; that an offshore drilling moratorium would be kept in place while lessons were learned ; and that the body charged with regulating the oil industry would be reformed . The president did not stop there . He spoke in lofty terms about moving away from fossil fuels , embracing a clean energy future and shaping the country 's destiny . But most Americans just want the leak to stop and that , two months after it began , remains a distant prospect . `` I say we ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy - because the long-term costs to our economy , our national security , and our environment are far greater , '' he said . But he gave few details and made no pledges about specific legislation , instead promising to look at ideas from Republicans and Democrats on the issue . He also announced that the national commission he set up to investigate the causes of the oil spill would be headed by Ray Mabus , a former governor of Mississippi . With this speech , the president has made a lofty appeal to American idealism , analysts say , but that appeal will not be universally welcomed at a time when Americans are mostly worried about the more pressing need simply to stop the leak .

Barack Obama announced the compensation deal after talks at the White House with senior BP executives . Shortly afterwards , BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said dividends would not be paid for the rest of this year . The payout fund is to be run by Kenneth Feinberg , a lawyer who oversaw compensation after the 9\\/11 attacks . In his current role as Mr Obama 's `` pay tsar '' , Mr Feinberg sets salary limits for executives at firms in receipt of federal bailout funds . Mr Obama said a $ 120m fund would also be set up to compensate oil industry workers . He said he had heard growing concerns about the pace of compensation payments , and that the new fund would ensure all `` legitimate '' claims were paid . `` If you or your business has suffered economic loss as a result of this spill you will be able to file a claim , '' the president said . Although BP has agreed to fund $ 20bn - roughly equivalent to one year of BP 's annual profits - reports said there could be no cap on the amount BP might be asked to contribute to the fund . The company will pay $ 5bn into the fund , called an escrow fund , before the end of 2010 , plus $ 1bn per quarter for the following three years . Speaking after the talks , Mr Svanberg expressed regret over the spill , saying BP felt `` sorrow and sadness for the tragic accident which should never have happened '' . BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg after White House meeting `` Words are not enough . We understand we will and we should be judged by our actions , '' he said . `` We will live up to all our legitimate responsibilities . '' Mr Svanberg was also forced to apologise after telling reporters that BP was not a greedy company and that it cared `` about the small people '' . He later said he `` spoke clumsily '' . The last time that BP suspended a dividend payment was during World War II . The company was due to make a $ 2.6 bn dividend payment on Monday , which has now been canceled . In addition , BP said it would sell off `` non-core '' assets worth some $ 10bn in an attempt to cut costs in the coming year . BP 's chief executive , Briton Tony Hayward , and the boss of BP America , Lamar McKay , accompanied Mr Svanberg to the White House . Mr Hayward , who has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the crisis , is scheduled to give evidence to a US House of Representatives committee on Thursday . There remains some confusion over how far the definition of `` legitimate responsibilities '' should stretch . Earlier in the day UK Prime Minister David Cameron said BP was concerned the claims could be submitted `` three or four times removed '' from the spill . The company has been accused of failing to follow proper procedures in the run-up to the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . The blast led to the deaths of 11 people , caused the rig to sink and has since seen hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil spew into the Gulf of Mexico .

The major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has taken a huge toll on BP 's share value - almost halving it since the spill began in mid-April . In addition , the company has said it will not be paying any dividends to its shareholders this year , after agreeing to finance a $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- clean-up and compensation fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Given that BP is of great importance to the FTSE index of 100 leading companies and the country 's pension funds - what impact will its decline in value and the scrapping of dividends have in practice ? What has happened to my BP shares ? BP shareholders have seen a direct impact , with the value of the company 's shares almost halving since the spill on 20 April . There have been two main factors behind the fall in BP 's share price . Firstly , concerns over the eventual cost of the spill , which is far from clear . The amount is rising by the day and no-one knows how big or how long the clean-up operation itself will be . Even harder to quantify is the eventual bill for compensation to businesses and workers affected by the spill and fines that the US government has said BP will have to pay . Although BP is setting up a $ 20bn compensation fund , the eventual cost could be much higher than that . Secondly , the company has said it is scrapping its dividends -LRB- the quarterly payments it makes to shareholders -RRB- in 2010 after coming under pressure from the White House . The move was not entirely unexpected , and the prospect of this happening has also driven BP 's share price down in recent weeks . You can add a third , too , and that is the usual nervousness investors display when any company suffers adverse publicity or uncertainty surrounds its future . What does scrapping the dividend mean ? Quite simply , it means investors will not get any regular payments this year from owning BP shares . That includes the first quarter dividend -LRB- about 9.5 pence per share -RRB- which had been due to be paid on 21 June and would have cost the company about $ 2.6 bn . This will clearly disappoint BP shareholders , some of whom may have chosen BP because , in the past , it has been a regular dividend payer . The last time that BP suspended a dividend payment was during World War II . There wil be no second or third quarter dividends this year . Payments to shareholders may possibly resume for the fourth quarter of 2010 , which will become payable in early 2011 . I 'm saving into a pension . Will this affect me ? Many BP shareholders will be pension funds . So the fall in the value of its shares and the axing of the dividend will have an impact . The question is how big . Pension funds nowadays only have about 25 % of their money invested in UK shares -LRB- most of which is in the FTSE 100 index -RRB- . The rest is in the likes of overseas shares and bonds . The National Association of Pension Funds -LRB- NAPF -RRB- , which represents a large part of the UK pension industry , estimates that 1.5 % of members ' money is invested in BP . You could use the same sort of rough arithmetic on dividend income , too . # 1 in every # 7 of dividend income from FTSE 100 companies comes from BP . But , as described above , pension funds have many more sources of income than just the FTSE 100 . BP 's own research says it accounts for 8 % of UK pension fund income . I have already retired . Could my pension be affected , too ? If you are already receiving your pension after saving hard for years , recent falls in BP shares or the suspension in the dividend will not affect the income you receive . That 's the same whether you are in your former employer 's final-salary scheme , which guarantees to pay a percentage of your last salary , or if you have already bought an annuity with a private pension pot . It wo n't , of course , affect the state pension either . And if you are nearing retirement , do n't forget that most personal pension funds switch out of shares as retirement draws near . BP is likely to feature in a wide range of popular investments , from FTSE 100 index tracker funds , which are far and away the most popular type of share investment , to unit trusts and Child Trust Funds . You may well have exposure without knowing it . So is it time to sell my BP shares or get out of related investments ? A decision for you , I 'm afraid , and not something we can advise on . Bear in mind some investments may incur penalties if you want to get your money out early . Did BP scrap the dividend because it could not afford it anymore ? BP decided not to pay dividends in 2010 for several reasons . The key one is that it has agreed to pay $ 5bn into the compensation fund annually over four years . BP has a strong balance sheet with relatively low levels of borrowing , therefore paying $ 20bn into an escrow fund over several years is affordable . Had it been forced to put all the money into a fund immediately , this would have weakened the company very considerably , BBC business editor Robert Peston said . It should be remembered too , that the $ 20bn is not the most it can be liable for . It is possible that the compensation it must pay out - a process likely to last for years - will exceed that level . Some observers say it there is also an issue of trying to limit damage to its image - arguing it should not be seen to rewarding investors while many in the US are losing their livelihoods as a result of the spill . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? "}, {"uid": "46", "dct": "2010-06-17", "dates": [null, null], "text": "By Jamie Robertson Presenter , BBC World News With its chief executive under fire during his appearence before US lawmakers this week , it ca n't be that much of a surprise that BP has lost its position , with its share price down by more than a third . Shell has taken its place , which has a certain irony since BP overtook Shell as Europe 's largest oil company just before the Gulf oil spill . BP was cutting costs faster and more aggressively and reaping the rewards . All that is rather academic now , and Shell 's investors are the happier bunch : for starters , they have a dividend , and they do n't have an oil spill . However , it is worth remembering that Shell is the second largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico , and although it and the other `` Big Oil '' brethren swear blind that the Gulf spill would never have happened on one of their rigs , offshore drilling could face serious obstacles . While the oil companies have been facing up to lower oil prices as the global economy makes its painful recovery , the miners have been ratcheting up their prices , thanks to China 's economy resuming its upward trajectory . The king of the commodities is gold , with the yellow metal regularly testing new highs . So Barrick Gold of Canada , the world 's largest gold miner , has stepped confidently into the Global 30 . Barrick 's profits doubled in the first quarter of this year , although the company claims it is not just the gold price that has pushed up its shares , but increased margins , reduced costs , and a pile of new projects ready to go . The market has also been rumoring it is ready for a big merger - possibly with Australia 's Lihir Gold . Rio Tinto also enters the index while BHP Billiton has moved out . There 's no dramatic change here . The two are evenly balanced ; both face the 40 % supertax being wielded by the Australian government , and both have massive international commodity operations , although Rio is bigger in iron ore and aluminium while BHP offers oil and gas exposure which Rio does n't have . All the same , Rio 's shares have outperformed BHP 's since it abandoned the sale of a $ US19 .5 bn -LRB- # 13.2 bn -RRB- stake to its Chinese customer Chinalco . It instead opted for a $ 15.2 bn rights issue and asset sales worth more than $ 10bn , which put its balance sheet on a more stable footing . But its expansion plans are less impressive than BHP 's . Rio expects to spend US$ 5-6bn compared with BHP 's US$ 11.5 bn . So BHP 's absence from the index may be short lived . The other big arrival in the Global 30 is Berkshire Hathaway in the financial sector . Warren Buffet 's investment vehicle is an anomaly : while it is one of the 20 biggest companies on the US market , the shares have been notoriously illiquid , not even meriting a place on the S&P 500 . But its biggest acquisition ever , of the US railway company Burlington Northern , forced it to split its B shares into 50 - Burlington shareholders would n't accept anything bigger . The surge in liquidity has given it an entree into global indices , and its value as an economic indicator , with its spread of business investments in everything from insurance to retail and manufacturing , is obvious : so optimists on the economy can take comfort from the fact that in the first quarter it bounced back from last year 's loss to report US$ 3.6 billion in net income . Diversification is a good bet in wild times . Mobile phone firm Nokia has lost out to competitors such as Apple The Australian Wesfarmers group has also been gathering together a broad range of businesses - retail , hardware , resources , insurance and chemicals . That 's protected the share price but it 's primarily in the Global 30 thanks to the turnaround of its Coles retail operation , which it bought back in 2007 in Australia 's biggest take-over yet . Now it 's thought to be looking for more acquisitions . The world slowdown does n't really seem to apply to electronics , where the pace seems as feverish as ever . Samsung is back in the Global 30 thanks to a rebound in chip sales as customers started to buy PCs again . Nokia is out as investors grow ever more impatient with its failure to find a credible competitor to Apple 's iPhone . Samsung came up with the Galaxy S , and it is staking much of its fortunes on tripling its 5 % smartphone market share this year . The competition is cut throat as ever and one gets the impression that no one gets to stay as top dog for long - something that may well apply to global markets as a whole next year as well as this .

Anadarko , the largest independent oil and gas company operating in the Gulf , owns 25 % of the well . The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , killing 11 workers . BP has faced mounting criticism for its handling of what has become the worst environmental disaster in US history , as the leak continues to spread despite efforts to contain it . But BP 's chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has said it remains a `` strong company '' despite the `` setback '' caused by the spill . Mr Svanberg has also said that Chief Executive Tony Hayward would be handing over the day-to-day response to BP managing director Bob Dudley . Mr Hayward was challenged by a US Congressional panel earlier this week , and faced accusations that the company had ignored dangers when drilling in the Gulf . James Hackett , chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum , said it was considering `` contractual remedies '' for what the company has described as BP 's `` gross negligence or wilful misconduct '' over the spill . `` The mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of BP 's reckless decisions and actions , '' he said .

The oil giant had said on Wednesday that it expected its partners in the well - which include Anadarko and Mitsui , with a 10 % share - to meet their legal obligations . President Barack Obama has vowed to make BP pay for the damage , and a criminal investigation is underway from which potential fines and damages could run into billions of dollars .

A containment cap and another device are capturing some 25,000 barrels of oil a day - the latest estimates suggest 35,000-60 ,000 barrels a day are spewing out .

At a US congressional panel on Thursday , House committee on energy and commerce chairman Henry Waxman said BP 's `` complacency '' before the rig explosion had been `` astonishing '' . He accused Mr Hayward of `` stonewalling '' for failing to answer his questions . But Mr Svanberg defended the chief executive , saying the answers would have to wait until a BP inquiry into what happened was completed . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that BP had to pay `` a lot of money this year '' . `` Whether the company can digest those expenditures , whether they will lead to the annihilation of the company or its break up is a matter of expediency , '' Mr Medvedev said . But the BP chairman rejected his company was facing that prospect . `` The company is strong , the company has strong underlying performance - strong cash flow , strong operations , '' Mr Svanberg said . But he added that it was impossible to know the final cost of the spill until it had been stopped . BP says it will withhold dividends until the end of the year as part of its response to the spill .

He accused Mr Hayward of `` stonewalling '' for failing to answer his questions . As a public relations exercise for BP , the hearing was a disaster , a BBC correspondent says . David Willis BBC News , Washington Maybe it was President Obama 's decision to dispatch the Attorney General - Eric Holder - to the Gulf Of Mexico a few weeks back to look into the possibility of criminal charges against BP that made the company 's CEO so cautious as he gave testimony . Time after time , to their growing frustration , Tony Hayward told members of Congress that it would be `` premature '' to prejudge the outcome of investigations into the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon well nearly two months ago . Mr Hayward 's reticence to be drawn further into the causes of the disaster led to growing frustration on the part of committee members , one of whom accused him of `` stonewalling '' . Another recurring theme of Mr Hayward 's testimony was that he was n't personally involved in decisions relating to the construction of the well which could have impacted on safety . Committee members had accused BP of cutting corners in order to get the well into operation , but Mr Hayward professed himself out of the loop on those matters . '' `` With respect , sir , we drill hundreds of wells a year around the world , '' he informed Republican committee member Michael Burgess . `` Yes I know , Mr Burgess replied dryly , `` That 's what 's scaring me right now . '' Over and over , the BP chief refused to agree with the conclusions of a group of angry , hostile Congressmen and women who seemed in no doubt , after their own lengthy enquiries , that BP had shown a reckless lack of attention to safety , Paul Adams reports . Infuriated by Mr Hayward 's inability or unwillingness to answer their questions , committee members resorted to expressing their disgust , more than one saying he felt insulted . Eleven people died in the Deepwater Horizon drill rig accident , which left a ruptured well spewing hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . Despite BP efforts to contain the leak , oil continues to enter the sea , threatening states along the Gulf coast . BP says it will withhold dividends until the end of the year as part of its response to the spill . The long-term hope for ending the spill rests with two relief wells now being drilled , one of which has reached two miles -LRB- 3km -RRB- below the seabed , or about two-thirds of its way to its target , US disaster coordinator Admiral Thad Allen reported on Thursday . It is planned is to seal the leak with concrete but that is not likely to happen until August at the earliest . BP 's shares rose more than 6 % after it agreed to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- in a fund to compensate victims of the spill . The increase halted falls that had led to the company 's stock value halving in recent weeks . Congressman Waxman said in his opening remarks that BP had `` cut corner after corner '' in order to save money , which led to the explosion and fire on board the Deepwater Horizon . `` We could find no evidence that you paid any attention to the tremendous risks BP was taking , '' he went on . This is going very badly for Mr Hayward and for BP '' End Quote Mark Mardell BBC North America editor `` We reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from BP , including your e-mails . There is not a single e-mail or document that shows you paid even the slightest attention to the dangers at this well . '' He told Mr Hayward : `` You 're not taking responsibility , you 're kicking the can down the road . '' One by one , other Congressmen , both Democrats and Republicans , questioned BP 's activities in America in a hearing which lasted some seven hours . `` We are not small people but we wish to get our lives back , '' said Bart Stupak , playing on a comment made the day before by BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg about how BP sympathised with the `` small people '' of the Gulf , and a recent remark by Mr Hayward about wanting his `` life back '' . Congressmen were angry at the effects of the oil spill Texan Republican Michael Burgess expressed surprise when the BP chief said he had not known anything about the well in question until he was told in April that drilling had confirmed an oil discovery . `` But you 're the CEO of the company , '' Congressman Burgess said . `` With due respect , '' Mr Hayward replied , `` we drill hundreds of wells around the world . '' `` Yeah , that 's what scares me right now , '' said Mr Burgess . A row erupted within Republican ranks after another Texan Republican , Joe Barton , suggested BP had been subjected to a `` $ 20bn shakedown '' by the Obama administration . Mr Barton , the senior Republican on Mr Waxman 's committee , was rebuked by his own party leaders and retracted his words , the Associated Press reports . `` I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident , '' he said in a statement . Earlier , as Mr Hayward prepared to testify , a protester briefly disrupted the hearing , shouting that he should be `` charged with a crime '' before she was removed . She was identified as Diane Wilson , a fisherwoman from Seadrift , Texas , near the Gulf Coast . Expressing his `` deep regret '' for the spill , Mr Hayward repeatedly stressed he was constrained in what he could say by the fact that a number of investigations into the explosion had yet to finish . `` There is nothing I have seen so far that suggests that anyone put costs ahead of safety , '' he said at one point . `` If there are , then we 'll take action . '' He said he had focused on improving safety for the three years he had been in his post and his priority was ending the spill and clearing up the oil . `` I give my pledge as the leader of BP that we will not rest until we make this right , '' he said .

We are not small people but we wish to get our lives back '' End Quote Bart Stupak US Congressman BP 's chief executive said answers would be supplied by his firm when they were ready . The questions , set out in a letter to Mr Hayward on Sunday by Mr Waxman and fellow committee member Bart Stupak , include allegations that BP : Went against the advice of its own plan review regarding the well 's design and chose a riskier , cheaper and quicker casing option Used only six centralisers to make sure the casing ran down the center of the well bore , rather than the 21 recommended by sub-contractor Halliburton Rejected warnings by its own plan review and Halliburton in preparations for a cementing job Decided to forego a recommended safety step in the circulation of drilling mud Did not deploy a `` lockdown sleeve '' that would have prevented the seal from being blown out from below The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

Earlier Russian President Dmitry Medvedev added further pressure on BP . He warned that the oil giant might face `` annihilation '' as a result of the fall-out of the oil disaster . In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , the Russian president described the spill as a `` wake-up call '' , and said that `` hopefully -LRB- BP -RRB- can afford the losses '' .

The company has agreed to put aside $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- to compensate victims of the oil spill . In announcing its downgrading , Moody 's said BP 's payments into the fund were `` managable '' , but warned that the full costs of the oil spill would have a negative impact on the company 's cash flow for `` a number of years '' . As a result , it downgraded BP to A2 from Aa2 . BP shares fell 0.6 % on Friday , after climbing almost 7 % a day earlier . Earlier this week , the two other major international credit ratings agencies , Fitch and Standard & Poor 's , also downgraded BP . Mr Medvedev was less sure about BP 's ability to cover its payments in the coming months . President Medvedev says BP may not survive the oil spill crisis `` What I know is that BP will have to pay a lot of money this year , '' he said . `` Whether the company can digest those expenditures , whether they will lead to the annihilation of the company or its break up is a matter of expediency '' . BP has said that it continues to perform well , with cash flow `` expected to exceed $ 30bn in 2010 before taking into consideration costs related to the Deepwater Horizon spill .

According to the US coast guard , around 25,000 barrels oil of were recovered from the sea on Thursday . That compares with the 35,000 to 60,000 barrels US experts estimate are leaking into the Gulf every day . BP has agreed to pay $ 5bn into the compensation fund this year , followed by quarterly payments of $ 1.25 bn until the total $ 20bn is paid . The company has also said it will be selling about $ 10bn worth of `` non-core '' assets to raise cash , and has canceled dividend payments this year . We are not wolves , we do not eat the weak '' There has been a great deal of speculation about what assets it might sell . In Russia , BP holds a 50 % stake in TNK-BP - a joint venture with AAR , which is owned by a group of Russian billionaires . According to analysts at Moscow investment bank Troika Dialog , BP 's stake in TNK-BP is worth about $ 16 - $ 18bn . However , analysts said that BP may have to take a hit on the price if it is forced to sell . `` If BP decides to sell its -LRB- stake in TNK -RRB- , it will have to do so with a discount to find a buyer faster , '' Viktor Mishnyakov , energy expert from Uralsib , told the BBC Russian Service . BP also owns about 1 % of the Russian state-run company Rosneft , which is worth another $ 900m . Rumours about a possible sell-off caused Rosneft 's share price to fall by 6 % on Thursday . The head of BP 's Russian operations was forced to deny the rumors on Friday , saying that BP has yet to decide exactly which assets to dispose of . For its part , Lukoil , one of Russia 's biggest oil producers , said it would not be interested in buying any of BP assets should the UK oil company decide to sell . `` We are not wolves , we do not eat the weak , '' said the company 's boss Vagit Alekperov . BP made a profit last year of $ 14bn , down from $ 25bn a year earlier . Analysts say that the compensation fund and initial clean-up costs would , therefore , be easily affordable for BP . However , they also warn that the threat of legal action and significant fines means it needs to conserve cash . Standard Chartered warned last week that the total cost to the company , including legal costs , could top $ 40bn . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

Environmental groups said the Isle of Wight outing was `` insulting '' to those affected by the environmental disaster . BP defended Mr Hayward , saying it was his first day off since the spill began after a deadly rig blast on 20 April . Mr Hayward spent the day with his son at the JP Morgan Asset Management Round The Island Race , where boats race around the Isle of Wight , off the coast of southern England . He was later spotted by photographers on his $ 270,000 -LRB- # 182,000 -RRB- Farr 52 racing yacht , `` Bob '' , at the event .

Earlier this month , President Barack Obama said in a television interview that Mr Hayward `` would n't be working for me after any of those statements '' . Here is a selection of what he has said and done to cause the controversy : President Obama 's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on Mr Hayward 's `` PR gaffe '' Mr Hayward is criticised by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel for taking time off to go sailing . In an interview with ABC News , Mr Emanuel says it has `` just been part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes '' . `` I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting . '' A BP spokesman says Mr Hayward had not had a break since the spill began and was merely `` spending a few hours with his family at the weekend '' . In a nationally broadcast TV advertisement , Mr Hayward pledges : `` For those affected and your families , I 'm deeply sorry . We will make this right . '' Tony Hayward apologises for the oil spill on the BP website He also promises BP would clean up every drop of oil and `` restore the shoreline to its original state '' . President Barack Obama says the following day that the $ 50m spent by BP on the campaign and allocated dividends should have instead gone towards the clean-up operation and compensating devastated local businesses . `` What I do n't wanna hear is when they 're spending that kind of money on their shareholders and spending that kind of money on TV advertising that they 're nickel and diming fishermen . '' Asked what he would tell people in Louisiana , where oil had begun to reach parts of the state 's south-eastern marshes , Mr Hayward tells reporters : `` The first thing to say is I 'm sorry . '' `` We 're sorry for the massive disruption it 's caused their lives . There 's no one who wants this over more than I do . I would like my life back . '' The statement was particularly criticised given that eleven people died in the drilling platform explosion that caused the spill . In an interview with Sky News , Mr Hayward says he is not overly concerned by the amount of oil that is flowing into the Gulf of Mexico . `` I think the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest . It is impossible to say and we will mount , as part of the aftermath , a very detailed environmental assessment as we go forward . We 're going to do that with some of the science institutions in the US . '' `` But everything we can see at the moment suggests that the overall environmental impact of this will be very , very modest . '' In an interview with the Guardian , Mr Hayward insists the leaked oil and the dispersant that is being released into the sea to try to tackle the slick should be put in context . `` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . '' In an interview with NBC , Mr Hayward insists BP was not at fault for the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon on 20 April and the subsequent oil spill . `` Well , it was n't our accident , but we are absolutely responsible for the oil , for cleaning it up , and that 's what we intend to do . '' `` The drilling rig was a Transocean drilling rig . It was their rig and their equipment that failed , run by their people and their processes .

That amount , included in an undated internal document released by US Congressman Ed Markey , is nearly twice the current US estimate of the leak . BP says the 100,000 figure is not relevant as it is not based on reality . US lawmakers have repeatedly accused BP of not being straightforward about the true size of the spill . Mr Markey - a senior Democrat and chairman of one of the committees investigating the Gulf spill - said the document raised troubling questions about what BP knew about the size of the spill and when they knew it . `` First they said it was only 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels , now we 're up to 100,000 barrels , '' he told NBC 's Meet the Press program . Mr Markey , who has been one of BP 's fiercest critics over its handling of the crisis , said the figures indicated the firm was `` either lying or grossly incompetent '' . A BP spokesman said the claims were `` misrepresenting '' what the oil giant had said about the leak - the worst environmental disaster in US history . BP says the worst-case scenario figure of 100,000 barrels a day was irrelevant because it was based on what might happen if the well 's blowout preventer was removed , which the company had no plans to do .

Kenneth Feinberg said President Barack Obama wanted to `` get these claims paid . Get them paid quickly '' . He also said he would `` err on the side of the claimant '' in assessing emergency claims from fishermen and businesses . Oil giant BP agreed to bankroll the fund , under pressure from Mr Obama , after the sinking of its rig in April .

Mr Feinberg ran the victims ' claim fund set up in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington . `` We 've got to get the claims out quicker , '' he told CNN . `` We 've got to get them out with more transparency so that claimants understand what the status is of their claim . `` And we 've got to ease the burden on these folks in the Gulf . I was there last week . I 'll be there tomorrow . We 've got to accelerate the process just as the president instructed me to do .

'' Mr Feinberg has said that individuals and businesses affected by the spill can file a claim for compensation for lost wages or profits , personal injuries or even death . His latest comments came after BP said that its costs so far of tackling the oil spill and compensating victims had risen to $ 2bn , including $ 105m paid out to 32,000 claimants .

A few misplaced words can cause a lot of damage , so why are they getting them so wrong ? There 's a chronic foot-in-mouth outbreak at BP and it does n't look like it will be clearing up anytime soon . Chief executive Tony Hayward has already been dubbed `` wayward Hayward '' by the media for his gaffes when speaking about the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Even when he says very little , he gets it all wrong . Facing US politicians in Washington last week he was repeatedly criticised for dodging questions . One frustrated congressman accused him of `` just kicking the can down the road like you have nothing to do with it '' . `` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean '' - Tony Hayward `` There 's no one who wants this over more than I do - I would like my life back '' - Tony Hayward `` We care about the small people '' - Carl-Henric Svanberg He 's not the only one at BP to be struck down by the complaint . Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg also attracted criticism last week when he referred to those affected by the spill as `` the small people '' . He apologised , saying his words were `` clumsy '' . Crises are unpredictable , but they are not unexpected . A good company prepares for the unexpected and a good PR team is poised to do damage limitation . So why is BP getting it so wrong ? `` BP 's communication over the oil spill has often been inexplicable and at times simply shocking , '' says Sharon Francis , chief executive of Media First , specialists in communication training . `` You 'd think those in charge of one of the world 's biggest companies would know better than most that one stupid comment travels round the world in a nanosecond . `` BP was slow reacting to what happened and failed to express appropriate concern and compassion , which is vital . As a consequence , any apology now just seems hollow . '' BP initially appeared to understate the extent of the situation , with Mr Hayward saying the spill would not be a major problem because the gulf was `` a very big ocean '' . Contrition and reparation are called for , says Professor Stephen Brammer , who lectures on corporate reputation at Bath University . `` Say you are sorry as quickly as you can and tell the world what you are doing to put things right , '' he says . Show empathy with those affected Often over reaction is what 's needed , not trying to play things down . In 1982 seven people in Chicago died after taking poisoned Tylenol tablets . Johnson & Johnson reacted quickly , including a huge US-wide recall of the product - some 31 million bottles - at an estimated cost of $ 100 million . `` A nationwide recall probably was n't needed , but it showed that the company was putting protecting the public above profit , '' says Mr Brammer . It 's also crucial to express empathy and that you understand the people affected . So far Mr Hayward 's biggest gaffe has been saying he wanted the crisis to end so he could have his `` life back '' . He later apologised and said the remark had been `` hurtful and thoughtless '' , especially to the families of the 11 men who died when the well exploded . `` No one cares how the crisis is personally affecting the life of the head of BP , '' says Prof Brammer . `` Getting his life back probably means being able to drop his kids off at school again or take his wife out for dinner . It was a stupid thing to say when he is dealing with such a catastrophe . '' This series of public-relation gaffes meant Mr Hayward reportedly received intensive training for his appearance before addressing US politicians at a Congressional hearing in Washington last week . It did n't help , say critics . He was accused of dodging questions , the assumption being that he had been briefed by BP 's lawyers not to accept any responsibility . But that does n't mean you simply shut down , says Mr Brammer . `` Trying to dodge things is ridiculous , it 's never a good reputation-management strategy . Even when you do not want to accept responsibility , you can distinguish between the legal and the moral . It is never good to use the legal mechanism to prevent discourse . '' Media consultants say BP has also suffered hugely because it has too few Americans leading its communications strategy . This has been extremely costly because Britain and America may speak the same language , but they use it very differently . `` BP 's communication has been done in a very British way , it has been very self-deprecating , '' says Ms Francis . `` Americans do n't deal in such language , they do n't see themselves as ` little people ' - they are a can-do culture . '' So why did a such a big company get it so wrong ? Most companies have strategies in place to deal with a crisis , say communication consultants . But that 's not enough , they should have regular `` risk audits '' to make sure plans are up to date and not just `` filed away and forgotten '' . It 's also should n't have a one-size-fits-all approach . `` I think that has been BP 's downfall , '' says Ms Francis . `` Situations vary and companies should adapt , like getting American PR people in to help in the case of BP . '' So is there any way back for BP ? Possibly , but it will take years of the right action and words . `` It 's going to be facing a reputation issue for years , but it is possible to rebuild things , '' says Jonathan Hemus , crisis-management expert with Insignia communications . `` Other companies should look and learn from all of this .

BP did not operate the rig , the rig was operated by Transocean and its employees . BP contracted Transocean to drill the well , the operation of the rig remained in the hands of Transocean . The faulty Blow-Out-Preventer is owned by Transocean and is clearly listed as their rig equipment for the DW-Horizon on their website . In this instance , i fail to see how equipment maintenance and upkeep could be any other party 's responsibility apart from the owners . As Transocean operated the rig , all rig workers interviewed were and are Transocean employees . This was not stated as there is inherent bias to any statements they give . The spill is described as the worst in American history and indeed it is , but this is misleading . It is not , by some distance the biggest in the Gulf of Mexico 's history which was the 9 month well blow-out of Ixtoc 1 in 1980 . Any comparison with the Exxon Valdez is also inherently misleading due to the difficulty in oil clean-up in Alaska and the climate . In warmer climes the oil is broken down naturally much faster by several processes . Oil eating bacteria are much more active , the action of sunlight breaks down oil particles much faster as well as natural evaporation of light volatiles . A comparison with Ixtoc 1 would have been much more accurate in this regard due to climate similarity . 8 inch thick oil was mentioned as being especially bad . In terms of clean-up this is a boon and not a bane as it is thick enough for a sustainable burn . The thin `` chocolate mousse '' is much harder to clear and therefore the report was misleading to suggest otherwise . In many ways these flaws are quite serious and is a little shoddy , but it all smacks of something cobbled together too quickly before all the facts are known . Whatever fine and substantial though it may be apportioned to BP it will be years in the courts before it is finalized . Exxon were fined by the court eventually a mere 17 years after Valdez . One small point missed by the report is that BP are liable for 65 % of the costs under US law , why 65 % ?? Because they owned 65 % , 25 % is owned by Andarko and 10 % by Mitsui . Ultimately BP will seek to apportion the costs in compliance with the law A superb investigation ...

He was one of a series of talking heads telling us that the exploration rig was being pushed aside hurriedly to let the production rig in and to let the dollars roll in . The quickest research would have shown that it can take anywhere from 5-10 years for a field to go from an exploration discovery to production . And 400,000 bucks a day rig costs are really very reasonable , we must speak more if you ever want to go into the rig leasing business .

Sorry , i have a few other things to say as i could n't read my writing earlier as the inaccuracies and deficiencies were too numerous and blatant . Tony Hayward was accused by the congress committee questioners of Stonewalling . The fact is he ca n't answer a lot of the questions as the questioners are lay people to Oil and Gas and have n't separated the respective company operations in their minds . i.e. Asking Tony Hayward about the specifics of the Rig safety will be hard to answer by BP as the Rig was n't owned or operated by BP . BP will not conclude on the causes of the spill until the critical failure of the critical piece of equipment is known and that is a mile under ocean -LRB- Blow-Out-Preventer -RRB- . Therefore to report Tony Hayward as stonewalling is to report the opinion of congress panel members as fact . This is lazy and second-hand . Estimates of the well flow continue to rise . This is reported as if it can be extrapolated . i.e. the well had always been flowing at 60,000 barrels a day . No-one can conclude that , they can only conclude on an estimation of the well flow at that point in time . I just do n't think BP would initially estimate 1,000 and other say 5,000 when in reality it is meant to be 60,000 . It would be too obviously wrong and found out . This points to the possibility that there was not initially much well flow and the flow has increased as the casing has failed further .

So could you please do a bit more investigation on whether it was BP or Transocean who stood to lose money by shutting down the rig to do this repair .

Oh but the shallow depths of investigative reporting these days of course does not allow any effort to go in and you end up with a piece of cheap hatchet journalism . The real issues were to do with who wants to make decisions in any oil and gas drilling operations in balancing risk versus reward - somebody has to . There is no such thing as a 100 % safe operation when you are drilling anywhere let alone in deepwater . No sane drilling manager is going to jeapardise an operation that is costing zillions of dollars by skipping a few centralisers on a cement job . But then Hilary talks to the rig workers as there bound to know ? We all know that the US litigation business is out of control so why is it relevant that a Texan lawyer sees BP as a big fat target for a law suit - is that news ? Looking at the claims flooding in to see just how ridiculous some of them will be would be just as relevant . There are a very large number of operational , equipment and service problems that can cause an accident such as this most of which will require a significant amount of leg work to review once the current focus on capping the well is complete . Is it surprising that BP do not want to pre-empt that process by jumping to a conclusion ? The trial before any proper investigation is typical US style mid-term election politics to deflect from other less savory US issues . Did the US President get put on trial when the US banking system failed the same way that Tony Haward is being targeted ? I guess I am not surprised you fell for it Hilary but next time get a bigger budget and do the job properly . I was looking forward to the program which was billed as giving some insight into `` what happened , and who was to blame '' but then it wandered off to show oil soaked pelicans and beaches ??? Was the oily pelican the cause perhaps ? Maybe the oily beach was to blame ? No wonder BP did n't want to talk to you , but you were happy to pass on the second hand overheard telephone call from someone to probably someone else saying they `` knew it would happen '' ! Sorry , but that was just shoddy journalism pandering to the masses and showing the sensationalist images we 've come to associate with the red top news rags rather than something befitting our national broadcaster ! In my view BP are _ right _ to say nothing until their investigation is completed because to do otherwise would be pure speculation , and there 's enough of that around at the moment already without the BBC adding to it .

Mr Feinberg has experience in such matters : he ran the victims ' claim fund set up in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington . He has said he is not aligned with the government or BP and will administer the fund independently . Who will receive compensation from the fund ? The oil spill has caused disruption along the US Gulf Coast , affecting fishing and tourism and fouling some beaches and marshes . Individuals and businesses affected by the spill can file a claim for compensation for lost wages or profits , personal injuries or even death , Mr Feinberg has said . BP has repeatedly said it will pay all legitimate claims related to the spill . The firm has set up a number of offices to handle claims and on its own has so far paid out $ 105m to 32,000 claimants . How will Mr Feinberg avoid fraudulent claims ? He has said it will be a problem `` making sure that this $ 20bn goes to pay legitimate substantiated claims and not fraudulent claims that we 'll have to be very , very careful about '' . However , he also said he does not expect bogus claims to be a big problem and that very few false claims were launched in relation to the 9\\/11 attacks . Mr Feinberg has said he will `` err on the side of the claimant '' in making emergency payments to people in `` desperate financial straits '' . There will be a difference , he said , between such a payment and `` a lump-sum payment that is the total compensation '' to a business or individual . `` Long-term payments will require sufficient corroboration so we can validate the claim , '' he told CNN . Some claims , such as that of a Boston seafood restaurant owner arguing his business has been hurt by the lack of shrimp from the Gulf , might have to be judged on whatever relevant state laws exist , Mr Feinberg said . How long will it take payments to be made ? The fund has been set up for a four-year period to pay claims but Mr Feinberg said emergency payments should be made as quickly as possible . `` I think when an individual comes in and asks for emergency assistance , that person should not still have to keep coming back for additional emergency assistance . We ought to give them a lump sum cheque that will tide them over until we can set up an emergency plan , '' he told ABC News . He said he hoped to have a transparent claims process set up in the next couple of weeks to distribute money more quickly . Claims could be paid within 30-60 days of being filed , Mr Feinberg said , once a system for assessing them was in place . How will the payments be made ? Mr Feinberg has said the method for handling claims was still being hammered out , but he promised a more transparent process `` so that claimants understand what the status is of their claims '' . He has also said people could file claims electronically and would not need to hire a lawyer . He said accepting emergency payments would not mean a claimant giving up the right to litigate , but added that it could take years to resolve a claim that way . What are the precedents for such a fund ? The main precedent is the compensation fund administered by Mr Feinberg for victims of the 9\\/11 attacks . The fund was created by an act of Congress shortly after the attacks . By the time the fund was wrapped up in 2005 , $ 7bn had been awarded to 97 % of the more than 7,000 claims . The average award to relatives of those who died was $ 2m ; and for those injured $ 390,000 . `` Only 94 people decided to litigate rather than enter a voluntary fund , '' Mr Feinberg told CNBC . `` That 's exactly the kind of precedent that I hope to achieve here . '' Claimants had to agree not to sue the airlines involved in the attacks and could not appeal once a compensation offer was accepted . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

In Cornwall we are only too aware of how oil spills can disrupt lives for years and years after they happen . In 1967 the Torrey Canyon was shipwrecked while trying to take a short cut between Cornwall and Scilly , when 36 million gallons of crude oil was spilt . Some people still say oil from the disaster is still washed up on our shores to this day . It remains Britain 's worst oil spill . Certainly there were huge problems for wildlife but as BBC Radio Cornwall 's Denis Nightingale reports , few blame those problems on the oil itself . It was on the 18 March , 1967 that the Torrey Canyon supertanker struck Pollard 's Rock between the Scilly Isles and Land 's End . The oil spill leaked and spread along the sea between England and France . The massive slick killed most of the marine life it touched along the whole of the south coast of Britain and the Normandy shores of France , it subsequently blighted the region for many years thereafter . Unsuccessful attempts were made to float the ship off the reef , and one member of the Dutch salvage team was killed . The ship broke apart after being stranded on the reef for several days . The Torrey Canyon clean up operation The Fleet Air Arm bombed the wreck in an effort to sink it , burn off the slick and reduce the oil spilling from it . Although the operation was declared a success , the Navy came in for some criticism for months as around a quarter of the 42 bombs dropped on the stationary target failed to hit it . The bombing was followed by Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm aircraft dropping petrol and napalm to try to burn the oil . Around 120 miles of Cornish coast and 80 kilometres of France was contaminated and around 15,000 sea birds killed along with huge numbers of marine organisms before the 270 square mile slick dispersed . An oil slick near the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill contrasts with the water in the Gulf of Mexico Further damage was caused by the heavy use of detergents to break up the slick . Some 42 vessels sprayed over 10,000 tons of detergents onto the floating oil to emulsify and disperse it - but as these substances were extremely toxic to many marine organisms they caused even further damage . The latest on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is that American coastguards who are trying to contain the massive oil slick say oil sheen has started washing ashore on an island off Louisiana . BP has begun placing a giant funnel on the site of the leak to try to contain the spill . Meanwhile oil services companies have been to court to try to overturn President Barack Obama 's six-month ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .

Along the corridors , signs point the way to the company 's `` crisis center '' . Originally designed to provide back-up space to cope with hurricanes , it is now hosting a desperate effort to tackle the first leak to erupt beneath a mile of ocean . The crisis center is staffed around the clock by a team of 500 people For a giant of a company , these are tense , threatening times . In fact , one of the first sights to catch my eye inside the center was a notice offering counselling and massages for stress . Some 500 people - mostly engineers - work in here in round-the-clock shifts , and they are doing their best to avoid being distracted by the storm of criticism , lawsuits , bills and allegations raging outside . Of the multiple crises afflicting the company , their attention is focused on the struggle to tame and then kill the `` wild well '' gushing beyond human reach in the Gulf of Mexico . In one of the few visits allowed to the media , we are led into a series of rooms where different teams focus on different parts of the fight . The largest is one running the containment operation - each of the vessels collecting oil from the leak is managed by a team here . One group is from a rival oil firm , Chevron , because one of their ships is being leased to BP and it is easier not to train new people to direct it . Monitors provide the only visual link engineers have with the spill 's source For a highly competitive industry , this would normally be an unthinkable sight . A neighbouring room acts as a marine traffic control center . Having as many as 20 ships and rigs crowded into a small patch of sea above the leak carries risks . And across a hall lies BP 's equivalent of mission control - a darkened room in which one wall carries projected images from the 12 remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- on the ocean floor . Before we enter , we are asked to be as quiet as possible . The place is wired for instant communications with the ships handling the robots . The staff , faces cast in the blue-ish light of the screens , are in charge of the only means by which the leak can be contained ; only robots can operate at the extreme depths involved . Will all this succeed ? Amid the exhaustion and strain , there is an air of confidence that more oil will gradually be captured and that ultimately the relief wells will block the leak . A center intended for the sudden , short-lived threat of a hurricane is likely to be busy for some time to come . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

An oil industry veteran , with 30 years ' experience , he joined the board of BP 18 months ago . But his most high-profile role was as the chief executive of BP 's joint venture in Russia , exploiting oil fields in eastern Siberia . He was appointed in 2003 when BP went into partnership with a group of Russian billionaires known as AAR . The deal was worth $ 6bn -LRB- # 3.6 bn at the time -RRB- . Under Mr Dudley , the joint venture increased oil output by a third to 1.6 million barrels per day . However , Mr Dudley fell out with AAR , who accused him of favoring BP . The dispute escalated and became increasingly politicised . BP 's technical staff were barred from working in Russia by a Siberian court . The security service , the FSB , twice raided TNK-BP 's offices in Moscow . In June 2008 , Mr Dudley himself left Russia in haste when his visa was not renewed . At the time , he said he had faced `` sustained harassment '' from the Russian authorities . For five months , he attempted to run TNK-BP from an undisclosed secret location outside Russia but resigned in December 2008 . In April 2009 , Mr Dudley joined the board of BP with responsibility for the company 's operations in Asia and the Americas . Mr Dudley began his career with the oil company Amoco in 1979 , moving to BP when it took over Amoco in 1998 . He worked in Russia for Amoco , and later oversaw BP 's operations in Russia , the Caspian Sea and other areas . From a PR point of view , it helps BP that Mr Dudley is American , not British . Better still for BP , he grew up in Mississippi and speaks with the accent of the American South . He knows the Gulf coast well . BP has been playing down the significance of the news that Mr Dudley is to assume control immediately of the operation in the Gulf of Mexico . His appointment was announced on 4 June but was only supposed to take effect in August . However , the fact that he has taken up his post ahead of schedule may indicate that BP is feeling the heat from its failure to cap the well or provide a satisfactory explanation to the US authorities . BP 's share value has slid by almost 50 per cent since the oil leak began on 20 April . Tony Hayward , BP 's beleaguered chief executive , has described Mr Dudley as `` the management team 's Foreign Secretary - or perhaps Secretary of State in American terms '' . Mr Dudley will need all the diplomatic skills he can muster if he is to repair the damage done to BP 's reputation . My Hayward has come in for fierce criticism from the US media When Tony Hayward , 53 , became BP 's chief executive in 2007 he told journalists that his number-one task was to focus `` laser-like '' on safety and reliability . He showed all the energy and excitement one would expect from a man who had climbed to the top of one of the world 's biggest companies - and could now stamp his mark on it . He inherited a company severely tarnished by the deaths of 15 employees at a refinery in Texas and by an oil spillage from a fractured pipeline in Alaska . But Mr Hayward promised that BP would do things differently , telling the Texas-based Houston Chronicle newspaper : `` The task is to restore confidence . '' How quickly things change . Then aged 50 , but looking much younger , Mr Hayward now wears a drained , slightly haunted expression . The excitement he showed in the early days of his tenure seems absent today . No wonder , after being declared public enemy No 1 in America . Mr Hayward has been demonised by the US media as being responsible for the world 's worst environmental disaster - and , let 's not forget , for the deaths of 11 men in the rig explosion that preceded it . Critics argue that , as the man in charge , it is Mr Hayward 's job to take the heat . Nor has he helped his cause with some misguided remarks about wanting his life back and optimistic comments about the clean-up operation . But the hostility must be a crushing weight to bear , especially for a man whose declared intention on becoming chief executive was take a lower profile than his predecessor , Lord -LRB- John -RRB- Browne of Madingley . By the time he departed Lord Browne had become as well known for his celebrity friends and political connections as for his business successes . Mr Hayward 's appointment was in part a desire by the BP board to get back to basics . He was seen as a old-school oil man , happier having a beer with rig workers than , like Lord Browne , drinking fine wine with prime ministers and presidents . Words such as `` informal '' , `` quiet '' or `` easy-going '' are often used to describe his manner . Born in 1957 , the eldest of seven children , Mr Hayward gained a first class geology degree from Aston University , in Birmingham , and PhD from Edinburgh University at the age 22 . Married , with two children , Mr Hayward considered going into academia , but instead went to BP in 1982 and was posted first to Aberdeen , home of the UK 's North Sea oil boom . Mr Hayward has spoken frequently of his love of the offshore life and of touring the world in various BP jobs . But he was eventually talent-spotted by Lord Browne , and became one of his Turtles -LRB- a name Browne gave to his inner circle of high fliers -RRB- a reference to the fearsome cartoon warriors , the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Mr Hayward rose to become head of exploration and production , a key role in any oil company , and was long identified as Lord Browne 's likely successor . When Lord Browne resigned after having lied to a UK court about his relationship with a male escort , no one was surprised when Mr Hayward took over . But he had already begun positioning himself , telling a conference some months earlier that BP needed to change its leadership style because it was `` too directive and does n't listen sufficiently well . '' Mr Svanberg is coming under increasing pressure While Tony Hayward has been made the fall guy by US media for the oil disaster , chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg is increasingly under the spotlight from the UK press . Several commentators have queried Mr Svanberg 's lack of visibility during the crisis , with Financial Times columnist Jonathan Guthrie saying he is `` proving lower-profile than an agoraphobic prairie dog '' . This may be about to change if reports are correct that Mr Hayward is returning to London , while Mr Svanberg now directs BP 's response to the growing political crisis the company is facing in America . Mr Svanberg 's supporters point out that he only became chairman in January , and only joined the BP board five months earlier . He has no oil industry experience , having most recently spent six years as president and chief executive of Swedish telecoms group Ericsson . However , while he may not have been able to answer detailed operational questions , critics say a chairman 's role is to take the lead in times of crisis , especially in dealings with governments and investors . When he was appointed chairman Mr Svanberg said last year that he recognized it was a big challenge `` following such a distinguished predecessor '' . This predecessor was Peter Sutherland , who cut his teeth in Irish politics and at the European Commission , and is unlikely to have been found on the sidelines if the crisis happened during his watch . There was , at the time , some surprise that BP had gone outside the industry to find Mr Sutherland 's replacement . But , then , so did Royal Dutch Shell , BP 's bigger rival , when it appointed former Nokia boss Jorma Ollila as its chairman . Married , with three children , Mr Svanberg , 57 , has had a distinguished career . Born in the Swedish town of Porjus , inside the Arctic Circle , he received a Masters degree in engineering from the Institute of Technology at Linkoping University . After graduating in 1977 , he worked for ABB on various foreign assignments , then moving to security company Securitas . He led the spin out of Assa Abloy from Securitas in 1994 and , with the help of numerous acquisitions , boosted turnover seven-fold . A big ice hockey fan and accomplished player in his youth , Mr Svanberg took the top job at Ericsson in 2003 , steering a then loss-making company through a big and often painful restructuring . His reward was to be given the King of Sweden 's medal for his contribution to Swedish industry - and to have garnered enough plaudits to make him a contender to chair one of the world 's great energy groups . Ironically , Mr Svanberg 's single biggest skill , according to one analyst who has watched his career , is `` stewarding companies through difficult times '' . There are many observers who think that Mr Svanberg could be putting that skill to better use today . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

BP was forced to remove the cap after an underwater robot bumped into the venting system . Gas had risen through the vent that carried warm water down to prevent ice-like crystals from forming in the cap . The cap has been partially containing the leaking oil and directing some of it to a surface ship . The decision to remove the cap for repairs meant that oil was flowing unhindered into the ocean for about 10 hours on Wednesday . Crude has been leaking at a rate of between 30,000 to 60,000 barrels per day , according to US scientists . The cap has been collecting roughly 16,000 barrels every 24 hours , BP says . In a separate development , two workers involved in the clean-up operation died , Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen said . One death , he said , appeared to have been a swimming pool-related accident , while the second one was an apparent suicide . It was not immediately known when the deaths had occurred and which company either of the two victims had been working for . The spill was caused by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which killed 11 workers . At a press briefing in Washington , Adm Allen said BP had removed the containing cap after the underwater robot bumped into the venting system on Wednesday . The `` top hat '' cap , which works by trapping leaking oil and then sending it up to a container ship , was removed for inspection after crews detected gas , he said . `` They indicated the problem was a remotely-operated vehicle had bumped into one of the vents , '' he said . The slick has closed fishing grounds , killed hundreds of turtles and seabirds and dozens of dolphins and affected the coastlines of four US states . Emergency workers and fishermen in Florida said the oil was now being washed ashore on Pensacola Beach . `` It 's just a line of black all the way down the beach as far as you can see in both directions . It 's ruined , '' said Pensacola fisherman Steve Anderson . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

The ship is orbiting the nucleus of activity at the site of the oil spill , held at a distance of five nautical miles . The ship has been modified to meet the needs of the scientists studying this leak Researchers Professor David Valentine from University of California in Santa Barbara and Professor John Kessler of Texas A & M University are onboard for a 10 day cruise hoping to answer some basic questions about how much crude is flowing and where it s going . Although usually referred to as an oil spill , the leak is made up of over 40 % natural gas mostly methane , propane and ethane . Much of the methane in particular seems to be trapped in the water , rather than rising to the surface . Atmospheric measurements just above the water don t show elevated readings of the gas , so the scientists believe it is held at depth , and spreading in what they re calling plumes horizontal layers of gas and oil . By measuring the methane levels at different depths and positions , scientists are hoping to get an idea of where the undersea plumes of oil are and what s happening to them . This will hopefully give them a better understanding of how this deep water spill is behaving and where the oil is traveling . Whether the amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane leaking will have an effect on climate change when it eventually reaches the atmosphere as well as calculating the quantity of trapped methane could also help with estimates of total oil leaking .

Although estimates vary , the growing consensus among scientists is that even with the cap that has now been placed over the leak , some 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day of crude oil are continuing to flow into the waters of the Gulf . Latest estimates suggest that some 3m barrels of oil have already entered the seas since the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk on April 20 . Parts of Caribbean at risk So far it has been the US that has suffered , but as the hurricane season gets underway and ocean currents undergo seasonal changes , there is a slight but hard to predict possibility that if the flow is not stopped in August when relief wells being drilled by BP are expected to be complete , some parts of the Western Caribbean could also be at risk . The Caribbean islands might be affected us the leak is not contained Forecasting hurricane frequency , intensity and tracking is a far from exact science ; but the suggestion this year is that higher than average sea temperatures in the Caribbean Sea may result in greater activity and intensity and for hurricanes to form off the southeast coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico , or in the northeastern Caribbean . Concern about the spill was raised when Cariforum Foreign Ministers met the US Secretary of State , Hilary Clinton in Barbados on June 18th . There , in what was described as a sobering analysis , the Bahamian Foreign Minister , Brent Symonette , spoke about the consequences of the oil reaching Caribbean shores . Most experts believe this possibility to be slight . This is because the ocean currents in and around the Caribbean move in north-westerly direction from the Eastern Caribbean to the Gulf of Mexico . They then join the Yucatan Current and the Florida Current , looping southwards around the west coast of Florida before proceeding on and up the eastern coast of the US . A report from the Mona Institute of Applied Sciences -LRB- MIAS -RRB- at the University the West Indies suggests that as the oil disperses from the spill site it will in time likely travel south , join the loop current and eventually follow it around Florida and along the US Atlantic coast and away from most of the Caribbean . Confirming this , in the short term , charts and diagrams produced by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- suggest any oil bearing currents will follow an offshore course past Havana to the north of the Cuban coast , before turning and passing to the west of the Bahamas . However elements of unpredictability exist should any hurricane develop in the Gulf of Mexico causing sea surges and changes in the movement of the undersea currents . MIAS 's conclusion is that although any imminent threat to Caribbean beaches and wildlife seems unlikely , the Caribbean needs to formulate a response plan to protect the beaches that sustain its economy and wildlife . Such considerations apart , the spill is having a number of immediate side effects . Although it has only marginally affected the timing of cruise ship sailings to the Caribbean , major lines like Carnival will not sail at night near the areas where the oil spill is . Cruise lines like ` Oasis of the Ocean ' might not sail at night near the affected areas Cruise lines are also having to inspect ships for contaminated hulls . More positively the price for Surinamese and Guyanese shrimp has surged as US Gulf Coast suppliers have had to turn to imports and cease domestic operations . More significantly , what has happened is leading globally to questions being asked about the risks associated with the recovery of oil at greater or lesser depths in environmentally sensitive waters in regions such as the Caribbean . This together with the continuing uncertainties surrounding oil prices and high levels of regional indebtedness suggests that the Caribbean as a whole ought to be giving greater thought to the promotion of investment in sources of sustainable energy and how this might be linked to investment , development assistance and to carbon credits . Some nations have already understood this . Last week a delegation from the Cuban energy sector has been in the UK and Italy meeting with industry specialists and potential investors and their advisers to discuss opportunities relating to using biomass , hydro power and other forms of sustainable energy including wind , solar and tidal action . Wind farms are considered as efficient forms of sustainable energy During their visit what became clear was that Cuba was paying great attention to alternative approaches to power generation , in areas where other large Caribbean nations have equal or better opportunities to encourage investment and external support . This is interesting , not least because Cuba has taken a conscious decision - despite its preferential arrangements with Venezuela , under the PetroCaribe accord - that it will develop a fully sustainable approach initially focusing on using sugar cane as the feedstock for the generation of energy . President Obama too , irrespective of the powerful US oil lobby , wants to begin to end his nation 's addiction to fossil fuels . He is trying to build on the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico to encourage a national sense of urgency . Speaking from the White House he suggested that there was a need to embark on a mission to develop clean energy technologies . The consequences of our inaction , he said , were in plain sight . `` Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries ... . Each day , we send nearly US$ 1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil . And today , as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude '' . In the Cariforum meeting with Hilary Clinton it was also recognized that energy security and mitigating the impact of climate change were linked and fundamental to the future development , growth and stability . President Obama 's message resulting from the Deepwater Horizon disaster is as much one for the Caribbean as for the people of the US . A heavily indebted region can not expect to receive for ever oil at subsidized prices from Venezuela , a nation that has economic problems of its own . If Cuba can start down a road to developing new sources of energy with external participation , so too should the rest of the region .

The company made an annual profit of nearly $ 14bn last year , but there is great uncertainty over the impact that legal action and compensation claims could have . BP has already said it will not be paying any dividends to its shareholders this year , after agreeing to finance a $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- clean-up and compensation fund for the oil spill .

Now it is sending its products to the Gulf of Mexico to help cope with the consequences of the BP oil spill . The company 's managing director Seamus Connolly said that the company is also meeting increasing demand from other parts of the world . `` Other countries where there is offshore or deepwater drilling are revising their emergency procedures , '' Mr Connolly said . `` We are receiving orders from places like Greenland and the Middle East because governments are very reluctant to allow any drilling to go ahead unless there is adequate provision for protection against possible spills . '' The company 's wildlife rescue system involves fitting the tanks with a netting enclosure , along with a water treatment and recirculation system . Oil from the birds or animals is passed through a bacteriological filter , which means that 90 % can be recirculated through the tank to reduce the cost of treatment . Mr Connolly said that the company had also been carrying out research and development to simplify the manufacturing process , and reduce the labor costs . However , the extra demand means that he has had to take on additional staff . `` Normally at this time of year we recruit some engineering students to give them experience and to work on specific projects . `` We have had to look for them earlier than usual because of the extra demand , which looks as if it will keep us busy for the next couple of years at least .

In the mayor 's office , tucked away in a town hall that is now also home to BP 's staff in this part of Louisiana , various local leaders sit around in matching light blue polo shirts . `` We 're not too popular for saying it , but here BP 's doing good , '' one says . There 's general agreement . It could be a bonanza today , but what about the future ?

BP 's done more than they ever did , '' another says . For obvious reasons the fishermen and others whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are cagey when asked about how the British oil company has responded to the disaster . Few want to go on the record in expressing praise , but all along Jean Lafitte Boulevard , the main street here , people pragmatically note that BP is probably doing as good a job as anyone could . There 's some criticism for Tony Hayward , the BP executive who was in charge of the clean-up effort until recently . `` Perhaps he was n't very good , perhaps it was his manner , '' one person says , but now he 's been replaced , things feel a bit better . The oil has damaged beaches and marshes across the region `` I think BP 's possibly doing all they can to help us , '' the local mayor , Timothy Kerner , says of the local effort . He 's exhausted , after working 18 hour days , seven days a week for the last ten weeks . He 's also frustrated , but with the government . `` I would think that for whatever reason the federal government left it up to BP to solve it . -LRB- But -RRB- now they 've put the coastguard in to do the work . The coastguard is more of a problem than a problem solver . `` There are too many jurisdiction battles between parishes with coastguard leaders , and I actually thought we were doing better working straight with BP to be honest with you . '' If qualified-praise for BP is a taboo subject in public , an even more delicate topic is what you might call the mini-oil boom that this disaster has brought with it . Down by the water , it 's clear that BP money is employing a small army of people , from near and far . One contractor - a teacher - has traveled down from Minnesota . He 's taken leave from his normal job , left his kids with his wife , and come to make some money . `` It 's bad for the family , but they know it 's good in the long run , '' he says . Fishermen have been among those badly affected Out on one of the barges involved in the clean-up operation , another man who normally works for an electricity company has also taken time out from work . `` It 's different work , you know ? And you make money , '' he explains . And at the marina , another , a ship fitter , says he 's getting $ 12 an hour . Last week he worked 86 hours . It 's like a mini-stimulus plan during the recession . `` With the economy this is what you 've got . You make a few nickels or you make no nickels . If you 've got bills you 're going to come out here and hustle . '' Make no mistake , the fishermen , indeed everyone you meet here , would rather this spill had never happened . People are worried as much about the long-term ecological effects of the chemical dispersants being used as they are about the oil itself . One fisherman , Adrian Ruttley , who 's working on the containment effort , says : `` It could be a bonanza today , but what about the future ? '' He says he 's making `` pretty much the same '' money that he would be catching shrimp . But he adds : `` We do n't know what the future holds , and that 's what worries most of us . We made some money for a while here , what do we do for the rest of our lives ? '' At Nunez Seafood , the dock is empty . `` Normally it would be so busy we would n't be able to walk along here , '' owner Randy Nunez says . The business was set up by his father 60 years ago . He says this is the toughest they 've had it . `` Dollar-wise it 's hard to put a price on it , because we do n't know what the catch is going to be , but it 's in the thousands of dollars .

Tests identified the small amount of tar found on the Bolivar Peninsula , north-east of Galveston , as coming from BP 's blown-out well off Louisiana . But officials said it was unclear if it had drifted hundreds of kilometres from the leak site or had fallen from ships taking part in the clean-up operation . Up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day have leaked into the Gulf since 22 April . BP has said its oil-capture systems collected or burnt off 24,980 barrels of oil on Monday , according to the Reuters news agency . Over the past week , efforts to clean up the spill have been hampered by the first hurricane of the Atlantic season , Hurricane Alex. Separately , BP said it could cover the costs of the clean-up and compensation claims without selling new shares , amid rumors that a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund was about to buy a stake . The commander of the US Coast Guard in the Galveston region , Capt Marcus Woodring , said about five gallons -LRB- 19 litres -RRB- of tar balls from the Deepwater Horizon leak had been found on Saturday . But he said it was impossible to confirm whether they had drifted from the site of the leak , about 550 miles -LRB- 885km -RRB- away , or had dropped off one of the ships carrying collected oil to Texas to be processed . The joint BP-US government response team said there were doubts that the oil had drifted all the way from the spill . `` The testing found that the oil was lightly weathered , raising doubts that the oil traversed the Gulf from the spill source , '' a statement said . Galveston 's mayor , Joe Jaworski , said he was hopeful the analysis was correct and that the tar balls were not a sign of more oil to come . `` This is good news . The water looks good . We 're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly , '' he said . Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson meanwhile promised in a statement that any of the state 's coastline affected by the spill `` will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab '' . The coasts of four other US Gulf states - Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida - have so far been more seriously affected by the spill . Tar balls and oily water were spotted on Monday near the mouth of Lake Pontchartrain , a large lake to the north of New Orleans , in Louisiana . The world 's largest skimmer is one recent arrival to the Gulf Rough weather since Hurricane Alex passed through the Gulf , to the south of the spill , has hampered clean-up operations for the last week . Tests of a giant tanker refitted to scoop up oil have been inconclusive because of high seas , the ship 's operators said . The first of two relief wells being drilled to permanently cap the well is seven days ahead of schedule , but officials said on Tuesday that it was still likely to be mid-August before the operation could be completed . In the meantime , some of the leaking oil is being piped to the surface from a cap over part of the well . BP spokesman Mark Proegler has said the company hopes to connect `` by the end of the week '' a third tanker , Helix Producer , to its collection system to increase capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from the current limit of 28,000 . The Helix Producer will form part of a new collection system involving a so-called floating riser and four vessels which will be able to disconnect and reconnect quickly , reducing the time lost when collection is halted because of rough seas . The new system should be able to handle up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day . The Deepwater Horizon rig - operated by Transocean on behalf of BP and its partners - exploded on 20 April and later sank with the loss of 11 lives , leading to the worst oil spill in US history . US scientists estimate 35-60 ,000 barrels per day are leaking from the well , about one mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- below the surface of the water . Mud that is heavier than the oil will be pumped into the well to stop the flow of oil . Cement will then be pumped in to seal it .

BP 's share price - which had more than halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in April first triggered the company 's woes - has staged an impressive recovery in recent weeks . Yet talk continues to circulate of a possible strategic investor in BP - either as a welcome provider of fresh capital to the company , or an unwelcome opportunist sniffing a bargain . So what are the options now for BP ? On 16 June , the cost of buying financial protection for one year against a possible debt default by BP reached a staggering 10 % . I think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case . '' End Quote Alan Sinclair Oil and gas analyst , Seymour Pierce During those panicky days , credit markets were in effect saying that a BP bankruptcy in the next few years was more likely than not . Things have calmed down since then , although the oil giant 's bonds still trade at prices comparable with companies rated `` junk '' , even though the credit rating agencies have yet to actually stick that ignominious label on BP . The about turn has been extraordinary . Before its money and reputation began bleeding away in the Gulf of Mexico , the oil giant was considered the safest of blue chip companies , because its debts were so low and its income so high . `` I think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case , '' says Alan Sinclair , oil and gas analyst at stock brokers Seymour Pierce . He points out that just by canceling its remaining dividends this year , the company should already have enough money in hand to cover what he expects to be the $ 6bn -LRB- # 4bn -RRB- direct cost of the clean-up . That is about double what the company has already forked out to date . `` If you add in all the civil liabilities ... I would be surprised if it comes to more than the $ 20bn they already agreed to set aside , '' Mr Sinclair adds , on the assumption that the relief wells currently being drilled succeed in stopping the leak in August . The company could seek ways to limit its liability to the oil spill . There is already a statutory limit under US law for oil spill costs of a mere $ 75m , but BP long ago waived this limit , as hiding behind it would have been politically untenable . However , BP had two co-investors in the Deepwater Horizon well - Anadarko of the US and Mitsui of Japan - who together own 35 % of the project . The UK company has called on its partners to pay their share of the spiralling costs , and Mr Sinclair thinks that if it comes to a legal fight , BP would prevail . The oil firm could also take more active steps to limit its liability , for instance through a selective bankruptcy of its US business . But this would almost certainly be unpalatable to the company 's board , as it would enrage US politicians , including President Barack Obama , and probably cut off the entire US market to BP . So the political reality is that BP 's liability in the Gulf of Mexico remains unlimited , and this continues to weigh down the company 's share price . Strategic investor or acquisition target ? In this context , speculation has arisen that BP may look to an outside investor to provide a capital injection to help cover these costs . Share price lowest point -LRB- on 25 June -RRB- : 296p -LRB- 55 % fall -RRB- Credit default swap spread -LRB- 5 years -RRB- : 4.1 % per annum Data : Bloomberg as of 6 July 2010 Or alternatively it could fall victim to an unwanted suitor looking to buy up the company cheaply on the stock market . Kuwait is high on the list . It has had a relationship with the company ever since the UK government sold British Petroleum on the stock exchange in 1987 . But Kuwait 's involvement in that flotation serves as a useful case study in the politics of such investments . The Kuwait Investment Authority helpfully bought almost 30 % of the company after the sale was almost derailed by the stock market crash . But the Arabs later came under pressure from Downing Street to give up hopes of a takeover and scale back their investment . Yet today Kuwait may be the most attractive suitor . On Monday , Libya voiced interest in making a grab for the company . Resource-hungry China is also mentioned as a possibility . Its national oil company attempted to buy California 's Unocal in 2005 , only to be blocked by the White House on national security grounds . Among fellow oil companies , the names of Exxon Mobil and Shell are also being bandied about . But the resulting company might be unacceptably big and powerful for US and European anti-trust authorities . `` Even in Europe , the EU would have a fit about the anti-trust implications , '' says Mr Sinclair of Seymour Pierce . Indeed , he thinks the entire idea of an investor buying BP itself is questionable . Libya may be one of the less welcome suitors `` Why take on a company that is about to undertake several years of litigation ... -LRB- with -RRB- unquantifiable potential civil penalties ? '' Instead , he points to asset sales by BP as the likely way forwards . BP could for example spin off US subsidiary Atlantic Richfield to one of its rivals . Or it could sell individual wells and exploration rights to the Chinese . This would minimize both political and anti-trust issues , and allow BP 's existing management to keep control . `` BP can afford to fork out $ 4bn a year by selling assets ... and being flexible about -LRB- capital expenditure -RRB- , '' notes Mr Sinclair . The last possibility , and one that some market participants may be considering seriously again , is that BP will recover fully from its current debacle . Having promised to set aside $ 20bn in a dedicated `` escrow '' account , some are hopeful there may be a tacit agreement with the White House that this figure will represent a cap on the company 's liabilities .

Adm Thad Allen sent a letter to the oil giant 's managing director saying the company must hand over `` detailed plans and timelines '' on stopping the leak . The information is needed before BP is allowed to change caps on the oil well . Meanwhile , a court has rejected the government 's bid to restore an offshore deepwater oil drilling moratorium . The federal appeals court in Louisiana denied the Obama administration 's request that a lower court 's June order lifting the six-month moratorium be stayed pending appeal . The three-judge panel wrote that the government had `` made no showing that there is any likelihood that drilling activities will be resumed pending appeal '' . Further hearings on the issue are expected . The ruling came as BP said its operation to drill a new relief well to stop the Deepwater Horizon leak was ahead of schedule . The new cap BP intends to install should make a more secure seal over the wellhead . The company also plans to connect a third containment ship to capture more oil . BP began drilling two relief wells to stop the Deepwater Horizon leak in May But while the caps are being changed , the rate at which oil is spilling out of the leak will increase . And if the third containment ship , the Helix Producer , has not been connected when the change of caps is made , there will only be one vessel capturing oil . BP 's latest moves also are part of efforts to create a system for tackling the leak that is prepared for potential hurricanes . The US National Hurricane Center issued a warning on Wednesday about a tropical depression which has formed in the Gulf of Mexico . Stormy weather has already disrupted efforts to contain the oil which has been leaking from the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig since April . Adm Allen stressed the critical nature of this period of the response effort in his letter to BP Managing Director Bob Dudley , as well as demanding information on five key points : An outline detailing production by the Helix Producer and mounting of the new cap A plan for resuming the recovery at the riser if mounting the new cap fails A plan for pressure testing the well and transitioning from fully collecting oil from the cap to `` shutting in the well '' A plan outlining the management of oil reaching the water 's surface A timeline for the completion of the relief wells . BP says its operation to drill a relief well to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil leak is `` slightly ahead of schedule '' . Adm Allen confirmed this during a press conference on Thursday . Crews expect to reach the Deepwater Horizon well roughly 18,000 ft -LRB- 5,500 m -RRB- below sea level and drill into its casing in seven to 10 days ' time . But crews will not know how much time it will take to stop the leak until they reach the well . Adm Allen said if the oil was leaking out through different parts of the well , it would probably take until the middle of August to stop the gushing oil with mud and cement . `` If you have to exhaust all means for the ways that hydrocarbons are coming up the pipe , then that puts you into middle August , '' he said . Adm Allen added that if the oil was only traveling up the well 's central casing , BP might be able to stop the flow sooner . The company began drilling the first of two relief wells on 2 May and the second on 16 May . BP is facing massive clean-up costs and compensation claims as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil leak . As a result , the company has said it will look at selling some assets and attracting new investment . The US government has been highly critical of BP 's handling of the oil leak .

A spokeswoman for the company told the BBC it was `` ahead of the original schedule of completion in August '' . Asked about comments made by Bob Dudley , the man in charge , that finishing by 27 July was possible , she emphasised the caveats in what he said . Mr Dudley said completion between 20 and 27 July was possible but only `` in a perfect world with no interruptions '' . In his interview with the Wall Street Journal newspaper earlier this week , Mr Dudley added that such a `` perfect case '' was threatened by the hurricane season in the region and was `` unlikely '' . The US National Hurricane Center issued a warning in the early hours of Wednesday about a tropical depression which has formed in the Gulf of Mexico . Tropical storms could disrupt efforts to contain oil which has been leaking from the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig since April . Although the depression is not predicted to become a major hurricane , tropical storm warnings were issued for the Texas and Mexico coastlines . BP is facing massive clean-up costs and compensation claims as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil leak . Spokeswoman Sheila Williams repeated Mr Dudley 's caveats about whether the relief well could be completed by 27 July , saying such an outcome would only be possible without delays or interruptions caused by hurricanes or unforeseen problems . She also said that as the drilling for the relief well got deeper and closer to the leaking pipe the operation would become `` more delicate and technically difficult '' . Since the oil started leaking BP has tried a number of different ways to plug the well , including a failed `` top kill '' procedure which tried to staunch the flow by pumping huge quantities of mud into the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- that sits on the seabed . The company began drilling for the first of two relief wells on 2 May , and for a second on 16 May . The US government has been highly critical of BP 's handling of the oil leak . Congressmen have accused Chief Executive Tony Hayward of not taking responsibility for the disaster , while questioning him about alleged cost-cutting measures that could have contributed to the explosion and leak . On Wednesday the US government asked BP to tell it of any major asset sales or merger deals in advance , as it continues to keep a close eye on the oil giant . The highly unusual request was made in a letter from the US Department of Justice , dated 23 June . BP told the BBC it had yet to respond to the letter . In its most recent update , BP said the oil leak had now cost it $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- , though the total cost is forecast by analysts to be tens of billions of dollars . As a result , the company has said it will look at selling some assets and attracting new investment . Mr Hayward visited Abu Dhabi on Wednesday , with media reports speculating he was in the region to entice wealthy investors . BP said Mr Hayward 's visit was routine . Speculation has grown in recent days about potential investors in BP , including the Kuwaiti Investment Authority , China 's PetroChina and the US oil giant Exxon Mobil . These reports , as well as statements from BP saying the company had no plans to issue new shares , have helped the company 's share price to rally this week - including a 5 % rise on Wednesday . But despite the bounce , BP 's shares have almost halved in value since the Deepwater Horizon explosion on 20 April . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

The skipper was speaking as two of the subs - which can dive to 6,000 m - started a campaign of exploration at the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia . He added that there was still time for the subs to help BP with the disaster . The subs are searching for gas hydrates - a potential alternative fuel source - on the bed of Baikal . Yevgenii Chernyaev told BBC News that the problem had to be addressed at the highest level . Two oval-shaped submersibles have recently started their third season of exploration in Baikal - the world 's deepest lake . Anatoly Sagalevich of Russia 's Shirshov Institute of Oceanology , which owns the vessels , said that he had an informal conversation with a BP representative asking if Mirs would be able to help stop the leak . But he said there was no official request and no real discussions about the matter . A BP spokesman told BBC News that the company had not had any formal contact with the Russians . `` We 've had over 120,000 people come up with ideas , '' he said in an e-mail . `` We are looking through all of these to see which are viable . If -LRB- the Russians -RRB- want to contact us -LRB- or may have done so through some other channel -RRB- , we can evaulate their idea . '' Oil has been leaking from a damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico since a BP-operated drilling platform , Deepwater Horizon , exploded and sank in April . And though BP says it is now able to gather some 10,000 barrels of oil a day , using a device that siphons oil up to surface ships , thousands of barrels of oil continue to gush daily from the ocean floor . The US administration has already called the leak the biggest environmental catastrophe in the country 's history . Mr Chernyaev said that his team had held numerous discussions about the oil spill in the Gulf and the Russians would be ready to come to the rescue - but only if everything was done properly . The subs have discovered reserves of gas hydrates on the bottom of the lake Standing on a barge that transports the two subs after their submersion , the Mir-2 captain underlined that the subs were probably the only deep-sea vessels in the world capable of stopping the leak . `` Our subs are unique . There are two of them and they can submerge and work simultaneously . Also , they are powerful enough to work with any other additional equipment . `` There are only four vessels in the world that can go down to 6,000 m - the Mirs , French Nautile and Japanese Shinkai . The Mirs are known to be the best , and we have a very experienced team of specialists , '' he said . But Mr Chernyaev added that such an operation would have a chance of succeeding only if BP or the US government asked the Russian government to join efforts to stop the leak . Mr Chernyaev said the problem had to be addressed at the highest level `` It should all be decided on the government level . Asking -LRB- Anatoly -RRB- Sagalevich -LRB- of Russia 's Shirshov Institute of Oceanology , which owns the subs -RRB- to simply bring the Mirs over is nonsense . Even though we 're able to go to much greater depths than where the damaged well is located , we would n't be able to do much on our own . `` We need a team of international specialists and we have to know all the details and probably even build a special device to attach to the subs , and all this needs time , '' said Mr Chernyaev . He explained that the subs had already worked in much harsher conditions , such as the Arctic . The submersible 's pilot also said that the Russians were very surprised that BP and the US government had not asked them for help from the beginning . `` And we would not refuse to help , even though for us it would be very complicated , especially right now , when we 're already working on Baikal . But it does n't look like anyone seriously wants our help , '' he added . Mr Chernyaev was one of the pilots on the first manned descent to the seabed under the geographic North Pole , carried out using the Mir mini-submarines . The expedition was widely reported as a bid to further Moscow 's territorial claims in the Arctic . The Mir submersibles can dive to a depth of about 6,000 m The two submersibles started their third season of exploration in Lake Baikal on 1 July . Over the last two expeditions , they found reserves of gas hydrates on the lake bed - which some consider a possible alternative fuel source of the future . Gas hydrates are usually formed in permafrost or deep in the oceans . These are crystalline water-based solids ; gases such as methane are trapped inside them within cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules . Baikal is the only freshwater basin where gas hydrates are found in its sediments . Scientists say the depth of the lake - reaching 1,637 m - and extremely low temperatures of water near the lake bed both help gas hydrates form at depths exceeding 350m . The current expedition aims to obtain important data about these findings , and is also searching for new life forms , which might be unique to Baikal . Located in eastern Siberia , not far from the Mongolian border , the lake holds one-fifth of the planet 's fresh water and many unique species of plants and animals , among them the nerpa - a species of freshwater seal .

BP said it was `` disappointed '' that the firm had `` failed to live up to their obligations '' . `` Anadarko 's refusal to pay their share will in no way affect BP 's commitment to stop the leak , clean up the spill , and pay all legitimate claims as quickly as possible '' , spokesman Mark Salt added . He said another firm with a stake in the project , Mitsui Oil Exploration , had also not responded to a request to help pay for the spill .

BP also said there was no guarantee of success at such a depth . A fleet of 400 skimmers is in place to try to minimize the effects of increased oil loss . The company has two other operations ongoing . One will deploy a larger surface vessel to collect oil , the other is drilling two wells to intercept the leak , which it is hoped will provide a permanent solution . The larger ship , Helix Producer , could be in place to collect leaking oil as early as Sunday . BP says the first of the relief wells will be finished in the first half of August . The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig in April killed 11 people . President Barack Obama has called the leak the biggest environmental disaster in US history .

It 's not like putting a cap on a tube of toothpaste , '' Coast Guard spokesman Capt James McPherson warned . The new sealing cap - similar to a smaller version of the damaged blow-out preventer - has three devices that are designed to shut the flow . According to BP , the new cap `` creates the potential to increase oil and gas containment capacity to greater than 50,000 barrels per day and should improve containment efficiency during hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnect and reconnect times '' . The company said that `` there can be no assurance that the sealing cap will be successfully installed or installed within the anticipated timeframe '' , given it has never been attempted at this depth before . Experts say that the new cap will have to withstand enormous pressure . If the pressure becomes too great , another part of the well could rupture . BP said that contingency caps were at the ready on the seabed should the replacement operation fail . Meanwhile BP says its Q4000 containment dome is still in operation and continues to capture leaking oil . The president says this is the biggest environmental disaster in US history The Helix Producer is being brought in place and could be operational on Sunday . It has more than double the Q4000 's capacity to capture leaking oil . The containment dome currently collects about half the amount of oil gushing out of the damaged well . On Friday , the Coast Guard commander overseeing the response , Adm Thad Allen , said the flow of leaking oil could be contained by Monday . But in that time hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil could flow unabated into the ocean . `` We have a significant chance to dramatically reduce the oil that 's being released into the environment and maybe shut the well in altogether in the next week , '' he said . `` I use the word ` contained ' , '' said Adm Allen .

Some of the oil will be picked up by skimmers Oil which has not been dispersed or washed up on shore will be targeted by microbes . `` They use the oil as a food , '' says Prof Overton . There is an advantage in that the spill happened in the warm Gulf of Mexico , where conditions are good for decomposition . In colder climes , things can be harder . `` Contrast that with Exxon Valdez where you still have beaches where you can kick over cobblestones and still have pools of oil beneath them , '' says Stan Senner , director of conservation science for Ocean Conservancy . `` In the Gulf of Mexico it is a different environment . There is some greater capacity for that environment to handle hydrocarbons . '' But that is not to say the oil will totally vanish . There may be oil which becomes buried on shore , and oil may end up at the bottom of the sea in anaerobic areas - places where there is no oxygen to allow the microbes to do their work . `` We have never seen these clouds or plumes of oil dispersed in tiny droplets in the water , '' says Mr Senner . `` We do n't know how much is ending up on the bottom . Onshore , we do n't know how much is being buried . '' WHAT WILL THE EFFECT BE ON THE WETLANDS ? The Gulf Coast 's wetlands are home to a diverse range of wildlife `` The wetlands that are already impacted , if only the stems and the grass you see on the surface are affected then the recovery will be within one or two years , '' says Dr Larry McKinney , director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies . `` If the oil has penetrated down to the roots , then you are going to lose those areas altogether . -LRB- Wetlands -RRB- will go to open water and will never recover . '' It 's hard at this juncture to tell what the eventual effect will be on the northern Gulf Coast 's habitat . `` A coating on the leaves will kill the leaves but it does n't necessarily kill the plant , '' says Prof Overton . `` With events like this their impacts occur in different phases , '' says Mr Senner . First there is the initial wave of deaths , the animals that get covered in oil and die . Longer-lived animal populations will take years to recover The death toll Mr Senner is aware of already includes a `` thousand bird carcasses - half of them are oiled , others are just carcasses , a few hundred turtles , 50 or so dolphins '' . But those small numbers reflect the fact that only a small percentage of carcasses are recovered . `` The assumption is that the actual mortality rate is many times what has been recovered , '' says Mr Senner . `` The rule of thumb for the bird carcasses is that they find one in 10 , but that could be low . '' The question everybody will be asking is how quickly can animal numbers return to normal . It all depends on the life span of the animal . In the Ixtoc spill of 1979 , there was a 60-70 % reduction in shrimp in the year of the spill , but they were back to normal within one or two years , says Dr McKinney . Then there are longer-lived animals like dolphins , whale sharks and sea turtles . If a single generation has been largely wiped out , numbers might not fully recover for 10-20 years . And then there are the truly long-lived organisms . `` For deepwater solitary coral communities , their lifespan is in hundreds of years , '' says Dr McKinney . What will the effect of widespread use of the dispersant Corexit be ? Will migrating birds be severely affected ? How much oil has actually been spilled ? How much is buried in fragile wetland habitats ? What is the effect of oil on deep-sea ecosystems ? They could potentially be vulnerable to the oil or to patches of oxygen-depleted water created by the oil-eating microbes . When the microbes degrade the oil , oxygen is used up and carbon dioxide is produced . Dr McKinney is worried about `` huge clouds of low-oxygen oil dispersant mix , -LRB- which is -RRB- methane-heavy '' . The plus side for fish stocks on the other hand is that , severe as the damage might be , it will be mitigated by the break in fishing . `` They have closed such large areas of the Gulf that the pressure has been reduced , '' says Dr McKinney . `` Reducing the fishing pressure will allow more fish to remain alive and reproduce . '' So stocks of fish like red snapper could be back to normal within two to four years . But , the effect of the spill on species that are already under immense pressure - like Atlantic bluefin tuna - could be severe . HOW WILL ECOSYSTEMS BE CHANGED ? `` In ecosystems , when you wipe out large segments of them , the ecosystem responds to the absence of those things and other things come in to take their place and you do n't return to the way things were , '' says Mr Senner . `` Ecosystems are always dynamic . What we see in the Gulf of Mexico is an ecosystem that already had a number of stresses on it . '' Some animals and plants may be badly affected by the disruption of the spill and not regain their previous place in the ecosystem once conditions return to normal . But they will be replaced by other organisms . A lot of the thinking about the effects of the BP oil spill is informed by the work done following the Ixtoc spill of 1979 . But there are some aspects of the latest spill about which scientists find it hard even to speculate . Marine biologists will admit that not a great deal is known about the effects of oil on organisms in deep water . `` We know almost nothing about the ecology in the deep ocean , '' says Prof Overton . It may offer only a crumb of comfort , but the 2010 spill will one day provide that knowledge . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

BP and US Coast Guard officials said further analysis was needed before pressure testing could begin . If it proves successful , the well will be kept `` shut in '' and the leak halted until relief wells plug it entirely . The blown-out well has been spewing oil into Gulf waters since April . The US administration has sent BP and other parties a new bill for the clean-up . The administration says the latest bill is for $ 99.7 m -LRB- # 65.8 m -RRB- . The oil giant has already fully paid the last three bills totalling $ 122.2 m -LRB- # 80.6 m -RRB- for costs related to response and clean-up of the spill , according to the Obama administration . The test in the Gulf of Mexico , which was supposed to begin on Tuesday , will determine whether BP 's new cap can contain the oil . Coast Guard chief Admiral Thad Allen said the extra analysis would continue into Wednesday . This latest move to stop the oil comes a day after the containment cap was placed on the leaking well . The sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions '' Work on the permanent relief well solution continues . BP Vice-President Kent Wells said no promises could be made about whether the new cap would work . `` It 's not simple stuff . What we do n't want to do is speculate around it , '' he said . Shutting in the well would provide a temporary solution to the leaking oil . BP is continuing work on the relief well that is expected permanently to stop the oil . If the test goes as planned , it will mark the first time since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April that the leaking oil has been stopped . During the tests , BP will be monitoring the pressure of the oil in the well . High pressure will mean the oil has been contained inside the wellhead . But if the tests showed there was low pressure , Mr Wells said , this might indicate that oil was leaking elsewhere in the well . He added that if pressure was low the cap would not be kept shut and ships on the surface of the Gulf would continue collecting oil . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL In June , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface . However , this continued to leak oil and has now been replaced with a better fitting device .

BP expects no oil will be released from the well during the test process , but the company remains cautious . `` The sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions , and its efficiency and ability to contain the oil and gas can not be assured , '' it said in a statement . If the cap is unable to take the pressure , a pipe will be connected to the cap to take oil to the ships . Whatever happens , the well will still need to be plugged , which BP says may not happen until mid-August . The first of two relief wells has another 30ft -LRB- 9m -RRB- to drill before intercepting the leaking well , Mr Wells said . He expects BP to complete the drilling by late July . BP will then attempt to plug the blown-out well with mud and cement . By Monday , between 89m gallons -LRB- 337m litres -RRB- and 176m gallons of oil had leaked into the Gulf , according to government estimates .

It is the first time the flow has stopped since an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . The well has been sealed with a cap as part of a test of its integrity that could last up to 48 hours . US President Barack Obama said the development was a `` positive sign '' but noted that BP was still in the testing phase . BP executive Kent Wells said the oil had been stopped at 1425 local time -LRB- 1925 GMT -RRB- and he was `` excited '' by the progress . `` It is very good to see no oil go into the Gulf of Mexico , '' said Mr Wells . BP shares rose in New York trading on Thursday after the flow was stopped , having already performed well over the day . But BP is stressing that even if no oil escapes for 48 hours , that will not mean the flow of oil and gas has been stopped permanently . BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles emphasised that there was no reason for `` celebration '' yet , particularly for those in areas already damaged by oil . Test will last as long as 48 hours If pressure drops significantly well will be reopened immediately After test finishes , well could be reopened while seismic test is done If test is successful well could be kept shut until relief well is finished Or oil could be piped to vessels on surface as before Three vessels on site can capture 50,000 barrels a day And BP say use of fourth vessel by end of July would take capture up to 60-80 ,000 barrels Relief well on course permanently to kill well by mid-August `` The job is not finished , '' he said . The pressure testing is necessary to check the strength of the well . If the pressure within the cap on top is low , that could indicate oil is leaking out further down the well . If the pressure remains high , BP and the government will have to decide whether to try to keep the well shut or to leave it open and pipe oil to four vessels on the surface . The US government 's incident commander , Adm Thad Allen , said even if it was successful , the well would be reopened and oil capture by ships on the surface would restart while a seismic test was done . `` We can go back then and put the system under pressure again . Once we are convinced we can certainly consider shutting in the well , that is always possible and we would certainly look to do that . '' But he emphasised that the option of shutting in the well - closing all the valves and stopping the flow - was a `` side benefit '' of the new capping stack . Laura Trevelyan BBC News , Florida After three months of this - and so many failed attempts - people are sceptical . But at the same time the mood has brightened considerably , because this oil spill has had a deadening psychological effect on the Gulf Coast . The long-term plan is still to dig a relief well which will intercept the leaking one . People have just left this coastline , tourists in particular , because they do n't want to run the risk of having a vacation ruined by oil This could all go wrong . We 're only a few hours into the tests . The priority had always been to increase the amount of oil being captured and piped to the surface , he said . Whatever happens will be a temporary solution , ahead of a relief well being used permanently to kill the original well with mud and cement . The pressure test will provide useful information for that operation . Work on both of the relief wells is currently suspended because of the integrity test . One of the relief wells is within 4-5ft horizontally and 100ft vertically of intersecting . The pressure test was twice delayed before starting on Thursday , once while additional checks were put in place to allay fears it could make the leak worse , and on Wednesday by a leaking piece of equipment . Meanwhile , BP continues to face political pressure in the US . A congressional committee has agreed measures that would ban the firm from new offshore drilling for seven years . And in a separate move , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said she will look into a request by four senators to investigate allegations that BP lobbied for the release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi while attempting to finalize an oil deal with Libya . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced on Thursday it would hold a hearing on 29 July into the circumstances of Megrahi 's release . The 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 killed 270 people - most of them were American . Megrahi , who has terminal prostate cancer , was freed by Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill on compassionate grounds in August 2009 after serving eight years .

The House committee on natural resources voted in favor of precluding companies with poor safety records from offshore oil exploration permits . The proposed law does not name BP , but would apply to any company that has experienced 10 or more deaths in the last seven years . The April explosion of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers . According to the draft legislation , the deaths must have taken place at drilling , production facilities , or refineries , and must have broken US health and environment laws . North America and the Gulf of Mexico are one of the cornerstones of -LRB- BP 's -RRB- strategy going forwards '' End Quote Evgeny Solovyov Oil equities analyst , SG Securities The Deepwater Horizon disaster is still being investigated . BP has already accepted its guilt in a separate accident in Texas in 2005 that killed 15 people . Although the proposal does not affect BP 's existing US oil wells , if it became law it would be a major blow to the UK oil company , according to Evgenvy Solovyov , oil equity analyst at SG Securities . `` North America and the Gulf of Mexico are one of the cornerstones of their strategy going forwards , '' said Mr Solovyov . He estimates that over 10 % of BP 's current output comes from the Gulf of Mexico Were it not for the political fallout from the oil spill , that share would have been expected to grow over the coming years . However , Mr Solovyov cautions that it is far from guaranteed that the committee 's draft bill will ever pass into law . It would need to gain approval both houses of Congress before it could be signed by President Obama . Mr Solovyov said that if the US still wants to continue expanding oil output , and reduce energy dependence on the Middle East , then there are not many other players who could step into BP 's shoes . US oil production increased last year at its fastest rate in 40 years , thanks in large part to BP 's work in the Gulf of Mexico , where it is the biggest deep sea driller . Chevron and Shell are also active players , but Exxon Mobil has surprisingly little presence in the Gulf . `` Smaller companies will not want to participate now , '' notes Mr Solovyov . `` It 's too risky for them , if -LRB- a similar disaster -RRB- could bring down a company of BP 's size . '' Another reason to doubt the political viability of the committee 's bill is the possible knock-on effects for other oil companies . The proposed rules would also exclude from offshore drilling any company that has been fined over $ 10m -LRB- # 6.5 m -RRB- by US authorities for environmental breaches in the last seven years . This wording would also affect BP , after an oil spill at Prudhoe Bay in 2006 . However , since the Deepwater Horizon spill began , it has emerged that there may be many old wells in the Gulf of Mexico that were not properly plugged and have been leaking for years . If other major exploration companies are found to be responsible for these wells , they could also fall foul of this clause of the draft bill . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

BP began shutting valves linked to the new cap , but a `` small leak '' in a pipe has delayed the tests . The firm said it would take a `` short while '' to fix . The tests will find out if the well can handle the pressure of the flow . BP hopes the cap will eventually stem the flow entirely - three months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded . The crucial testing phase of the cap was due to begin on Tuesday , but anxious politicians asked experts to review BP 's plans amid fears that the procedure could make things much worse if it went wrong . `` I was gung-ho for this test and I remain gung-ho for this test , '' said Adm Thad Allen , the US incident commander , on Wednesday . But he warned that nobody wanted to make an `` irreversible mistake '' . After 24 hours of deliberation , officials gave BP the go-ahead , and the firm began shutting off the valves that were allowing some of the oil to flow from the well on to the surface , where it was being collected by container ships . Undersea robots then began to close the three openings in the cap that let oil pass through . Live video footage from BP 's cameras showed the first two valves had closed successfully , but engineers discovered a leak in a line attached to the third valve . `` It will take them a short while to fix this particular problem and then we 'll get the well test itself under way , '' said a BP spokesman . The middle ram valve regulating the oil flow on top of the cap is closed The kill valve is closed off The choke is closed ; this takes a couple of hours and once it starts the pressure test can be said to have begun Once the well is shut in , BP and government experts will assess progress every six hours But if low pressure is detected they will open the well up instantly Other precautions include extra monitoring , such as by remote vehicles on the seabed Once the leak is fixed , engineers will begin to test whether oil will leak out of other areas if all the valves are closed . The experts will monitor seismic , acoustic and temperature changes in the well and the surrounding area , as well as the pressure of the oil in the well . High pressure will mean the oil has been contained inside the wellhead ; low pressure could indicate that oil is leaking elsewhere in the well . If the pressure proved to be low , BP officials said that the valves would not be kept shut . If the well is not strong enough to hold back the flow , BP hopes it will be able to channel the oil to container ships on the surface . The White House said in a statement that the tests would provide `` valuable data '' about the condition of the well , and also a better understanding of how the well could be closed down during hurricanes .

The government 's incident commander Thad Allen said `` hopefully '' the test would begin later on Thursday .

The priority had always been to increase the amount of oil being captured and piped to the surface . The latest setback to the pressure test was a leak on a line on the choke valve of the new cap . The test had already been delayed while additional safety monitoring measures were put in place . BP took another choke valve to the sea floor and attached it to the cap .

Oil , mixed with dispersant , is billowing out of the kill valve . Once the test is under way , and the flow of oil stopped , the pressure within the cap will be tested . If it remains high , it is safe to keep the flow of oil halted .

The firm is checking how much pressure the well can withstand while the valves on its new capping device are closed . US President Barack Obama hailed the move as a `` positive sign '' , and BP 's shares rallied in early trading in London after sharp rises in New York . Oil has been flowing from the well since a rig exploded on 20 April . Eleven workers were killed in the Deepwater Horizon explosion , and the oil spill has raised fears of an environmental catastrophe . BP has tried a number of ways to stop the flow , but the new capping device is the first to have succeeded in stopping it entirely . BP executive Kent Wells announced the success on Thursday , saying he was `` excited '' by the progress . The firm will now monitor the integrity of the well in detailed tests expected to last until Saturday , with experts discussing the progress every six hours . The valves staunching the flow of oil will then be reopened and oil will be again channelled on to containment ships on the surface while experts examine seismic data garnered from the tests . If the well can withstand the pressure , then the valves can be shut again . Matt McGrath BBC News science reporter As with so many other aspects of the response to this leak , the latest steps are being taken without the luxury of being able to test them first . Engineers are concerned that an increase in pressure might cause new ruptures in the sea floor that could increase the amount of oil leaking into the water . They will also be looking specifically at the well bore - the 4km or so of piping that stretches into the oil reservoir . The rise in pressure caused by stopping the flow could cause leaks or fractures in this pipe . And the relief wells are edging ever closer to the source of the problem . One is less than two metres away . Any leak into this well would be disastrous for the efforts to permanently stem the flow . The cap is intended to stop the oil spill until BP can finish drilling relief wells and permanently seal the well - an operation expected to be completed in August . Meanwhile , BP continues to face political pressure in the US . A congressional committee has agreed measures that would ban the firm from new offshore drilling for seven years . And in a separate move , the state department is looking into allegations that BP lobbied for the release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi while attempting to finalize an oil deal with Libya . Megrahi was the only person convicted of the 1988 plane bombing , in which 270 people died - most of them Americans . He was freed by the Scottish authorities in August 2009 after serving eight years because he has terminal prostate cancer and was estimated to have three months left to live . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced on Thursday it would hold a hearing on 29 July into the circumstances of Megrahi 's release . BP has strongly denied playing any part in discussions on the decision to free the bomber . On Friday , the UK ambassador to the US , Nigel Sheinwald , wrote an open letter to the senators in an attempt to `` correct inaccuracies which are harmful to the UK '' . `` I am troubled by the claims made in the press that Megrahi was released because of an oil deal involving BP , and that the medical evidence supporting his release was paid for by the Libyan government , '' he said . `` Both of these allegations are untrue .

Twenty-one years later , the BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani went to a nearby fishing village to see how its people had recovered - and found not all of them had . Surrounded by jagged snow-covered peaks and perched on the edge of a chilly fjord on Prince William Sound , the small Alaskan fishing town of Cordova is in a beautiful part of the world . But 21 years after one of the worst environmental disasters in US history , it remains scarred . In March 1989 , the Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef and spewed 11m gallons of crude oil into the sound 's pristine waters , and , until April 's BP accident in the Gulf of Mexico , it was America 's worst spill . Today , oil can still be found here . Exxon Valdez oil polluted coastlines , contaminated fishing grounds and killed huge numbers of animals . Now , most of the species affected by the spill have recovered or are on their way back . But herring - once a major catch in Cordova - disappeared in the years after the spill and have never returned . Oil company Exxon cites studies that suggest no link , but local scientists and fisherfolk will tell you otherwise . This year Cordova opened shrimp fishing for the first time since 1989 They point out that the spill occurred during spawning season , that the inlets and bays where herring traditionally laid their eggs were choked with oil , that herring spawn at age four and that the herring population collapsed four years after the spill . Either way , Cordova 's fishing industry was badly hit . Permits to fish herring commercially had been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars before the spill but became worthless , leaving many fishermen facing huge amounts of debt . RJ Kopchak , a former fishermen turned development director for the Prince William Sound Science Center , says he held herring fishing permits and equipment worth $ 200,000 -LRB- # 132,000 -RRB- when the spill happened . `` Today , they are worthless , '' he said . The disappearance of the herring lead to the loss of money and people . Nearly a third of Cordova 's population departed in the wake of the spill , restaurants and five nightclubs closed and businesses went bankrupt . Sue Laird , a former fisherwoman who now runs a seafood company , said the fishing industry had begun to recover . `` We 're still missing herring , we 're still missing several things . '' But , she added : `` This is the first year -LRB- since the spill -RRB- we 've had a shrimp fishery . '' Exxon spent billions of dollars on the clean-up and claims against it , just as BP is doing in the Gulf of Mexico today . A court ordered Exxon to pay $ 5bn -LRB- # 3.3 bn -RRB- in damages . After years of court battles , the amount was reduced to a tenth of that , $ 500m . My heart goes out to those people in the Gulf ... I think they 're going to have it worse than we had '' End Quote Leroy Gilkinson Fisherman Many fought for compensation for years , and the stress took its toll . While Cordova is not a depressed place now , the scars remain evident . `` We had lost our community during the spill years , '' said Sylvia Lange , whose family had to leave Cordova in order to carry on fishing . Now , she runs a hotel in the town . She said watching news of the BP spill reminded her of how the town was split into `` haves and have nots '' , when some people working for the Exxon clean-up effort became known as `` spillionaires '' . `` All told there were 10 years of total chaos , families splitting apart , not talking to each other , divorce , '' she continued . `` And then there were 10 years of making it right again , and I think we were there , after 20 years . '' The BP spill has re-opened old wounds in Alaska . Many fear the past here could foreshadow the future in the Gulf of Mexico . `` My heart goes out to those people in the Gulf , '' fisherman Leroy Gilkinson said over a morning coffee and smoke in the wood-panelled bar of the historic Alaskan Hotel on the town 's main street . `` I think they 're going to have it worse than we had . '' View from Cordova 's Alaskan Hotel : ` The Valdez broke a lot of people ' Mr Kopchak , of the science center , said he does n't think Cordova will be the same again until the herring recover . `` In March of every year , commercial fishermen would begin to arrive back to town , those that did n't live here permanently , '' he said . `` The crewmen would come back to town , the cannery workers would come back , the restaurants would open up . `` Now that there are no herring , it 's not until May before the community has an opportunity to take an economic part in the fisheries . `` That means that many kinds of businesses that could make enough money in six months to stay alive no longer have enough time to make enough money to be here .

Adm Thad Allen said there were concerns over three areas of `` anomaly '' during monitoring for a pressure test on the well . The well has been capped to see if the flow of oil can be stopped without provoking leaks in the sea bed . If the test fails , the well will be re-opened and oil will flow out again . Adm Allen outlined the three areas of concern . Some seepage , 3km -LRB- 1.9 miles -RRB- from the well head , had caused concern . But Adm Allen said it was not believed that the leak on the sea floor was anything to do with the integrity test . Oil and gas leaks can happen naturally , and it may have been impossible , while the oil was still gushing out of the well , for nearby natural seepage to be detected . Another area of concern is nearer to the well head , a few hundred metres away . And the third cause for concern is bubbles of gas and small quantities of oil coming from a section of the cap . This may not be `` consequential '' , Adm Allen said . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs confirmed that gas bubbles had been detected by underwater cameras around the well head . `` There are bubbles that are visible on the underwater camera , which we continue to monitor , '' said Mr Gibbs . BP wants to keep the valves on the cap closed until an operation to permanently seal the well can be performed - a procedure the company expects will take place in less than two weeks . But Adm Allen is not convinced the oil giant should leave the cap in place until the well is permanently plugged . `` I 'm not prepared to say the well is shut in until the relief well is done . There are too many uncertainties , '' he said . The US government has told the company to be ready to remove the machinery immediately if the seepage is confirmed to be methane . `` We had some concerns , I think as you heard over the past 24 hours , about commitments that BP had made that we did not feel that they were adequately living up to in terms of that monitoring , '' Mr Gibbs said on Monday . `` That was dealt with last night on a call that lasted late into the evening , where we believe that we 're getting the type of overall monitoring , particularly the seismic and the monitoring with remotely operated vehicles , so that we can look at each of these different steps . '' BP and Adm Allen also discussed on Monday the possibility of using the new cap to carry out a `` static kill '' procedure - a similar operation to the `` top kill '' procedure carried out unsuccessfully two months ago . BP said `` static kill '' would involve sending heavy drilling mud down through the blowout preventer valve system and then injecting cement into the well to seal it . Bubbles are coming from the cap on the well but the pressure test continues `` We 're still very much in the design and planning phase , '' said senior BP vice president for exploration and production Kent Wells . `` We 've got some real experienced teams working on this over the next couple of days . '' The current pressure test on the well will continue into Tuesday . The flow of oil was stopped on Thursday afternoon for the first time since the 20 April explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers . A new cap on top of the blowout preventer on the well made the test possible . All the valves on this new cap were closed to start the test . If pressure within the cap on the well stays high , that might suggest that oil is only flowing up the center of the well . If it was to fall , that might mean that oil has found its way to the surface through the rock and sediment around the well . The pressure inside the cap is currently at 6,811 pounds per square inch and rising at 1 psi per hour , which is less than the desired reading of 8,000-9 ,000 psi . Adm Allen said this lower-than-expected pressure was being debated by the scientists involved . It may be that the factor of depletion of the reservoir of oil may not have been fully considered .

He said the US government and BP were continuing to discuss the possibility of a so-called `` static kill '' - an operation to pump drilling mud and cement into the well to stop the flow . BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said the deal with Apache was the first sale of assets to help pay for the spill . BP has already spent some $ 4bn on efforts to contain and clean-up the oil and compensate those people affected by it . The comany said the assets sold included oil fields and gas processing plants in Texas and south-east New Mexico worth $ 3.1 bn and BP 's upstream Western Canadian gas business for $ 3.25 bn . The deal also included oil exploration and production assets in Egypt worth about $ 650m . BP 's share of the Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska was not included in the sale to Apache , contrary to earlier media speculation . The company had also been thought to be looking at a sale of its majority stake in its subsidiary Argentine Pan American , which operates in Argentina , Chile and Bolivia , and is thought to be worth about $ 9bn .

Mr Cameron earlier met US congressmen who have accused BP of lobbying the previous British government to arrange the release because of its business interests in Libya .

A final piece of casing needs to be cemented in place at the bottom of the relief well before it can then drill into the damaged well . Once the casing is in place , engineers could begin the last drilling within five to seven days and then `` kill '' the well with mud and cement . There is a 50 % chance that a weather pattern currently over the island of Hispaniola will turn into a cyclone by Friday , the National Hurricane Center says . It is currently moving west-northwest . A reconnaissance flight is to be carried out on Thursday . Adm Thad Allen , the US official in charge of the spill response , said the decision whether to order ships out of the area would be a `` judgment call '' based on how the storm developed . Shell Oil has already begun to evacuate employees stationed out in the Gulf . Senior BP executive Kent Wells said the relief well currently had a plug in it below the surface in anticipation of bad weather . `` What we did n't want is to be in the middle of an operation and potentially put the relief well at risk , '' Mr Wells said . If the weather holds , a `` static '' kill - pumping mud into the top of the well through the new cap - could be done as an intermediate measure . BP and government experts are deciding whether this will take place . BP would need a weather window of two to four days to place the final bit of casing , cement it and then carry out the static kill operation , Mr Wells said . The cap applied last Thursday stopped oil leaking from the well for the first time since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April . Eleven workers on the BP-leased rig were killed and the oil caused one of America 's worst environmental disasters . The well is currently shut for an integrity test , to see if there are any ruptures beneath the surface . Adm Allen said BP and the government were still considering whether the well would be left shut or opened in the event that bad weather forced all the ships away from the site . Vast amounts of oil have entered the Gulf and BP says the cost of dealing with the spill has now reached nearly $ 4bn -LRB- # 2.6 bn -RRB- . BP has moved to sell assets in Texas , Canada and Egypt in order to meet part of the clean-up bill . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL In June , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface . However , this continued to leak oil and has now been replaced with a better fitting device . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL When engineers removed the LMRP cap on 10 July , oil began to freely flow from the top of the blowout preventer once more . However , the Q4000 containment system continued to take some oil to the surface . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL Engineers then bolted on a new capping stack onto the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- . This allowed them to conduct a series of tests to see if the flow of oil could be stopped using the newly installed equipment . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL During the test the three ram capping stack has been closed and all sub-sea containment systems collecting the oil temporarily suspended , effectively blocking the flow of oil from the well . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL Once the tests have been successfully completed , BP will resume collecting oil .

The BBC has obtained a copy of a contract offered to scientists by BP . It says that scientists can not publish the research they do for BP or speak about the data for at least three years , or until the government gives the final approval to the company 's restoration plan for the whole of the Gulf . It also states scientists may perform research for other agencies as long as it does not conflict with the work they are doing for BP . And it adds that scientists must take instructions from lawyers offering the contracts and other in-house counsel at BP . Bob Shipp , the head of marine sciences at the University of South Alabama , was one of the scientists approached by BP 's lawyers . They did n't just want him , they wanted his whole department . `` They contacted me and said we would like to have your department interact to develop the best restoration plan possible after this oil spill , '' he said . Russ Lea from the University of South Alabama : Some clauses in the contract `` were very disturbing '' . `` We laid the ground rules - that any research we did , we would have to take total control of the data , transparency and the freedom to make those data available to other scientists and subject to peer review . They left and we never heard back from them . '' What Mr Nelson is concerned about is BP 's control over scientific research . `` Our ability to evaluate the disaster and write public policy and make decisions about it as a country can be impacted by the silence of the research scientists who are looking at conditions , '' he said . `` It 's hugely destructive . I mean at some level , this is really BP versus the people of the United States . '' In its statement , BP says it `` does not place restrictions on academics speaking about scientific data '' .

When the deal with Libya 's National Oil Company was announced in 2007 BP set a minimum initial exploration commitment of $ 900m . Chief executive Tony Hayward at the time hailed it as `` BP 's single biggest exploration commitment '' and `` a welcome return to the country for BP after more than 30 years '' .

Mr Hayward was also publicly rebuked by members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee last month for `` stonewalling '' questions at a congressional hearing and of `` kicking the can down the road '' . Responding to reports that Mr Hayward was expected to step down , US Congressman Ed Markey - who chairs a committee covering the oil spill issue - said : `` While it 's now happy sailing for Tony Hayward , rough conditions will persist in the Gulf of Mexico for years to come because of his failed leadership . `` The new leaders of BP will have an uphill climb to correct the legacy -LRB- he -RRB- left , '' he added .

Many commentators believe Mr Dudley 's American accent will be advantageous from a PR perspective Many say that , from a public relations point of view , Mr Dudley has the advantage of being American and speaking with an American accent . He grew up in Mississippi and , according to BP , has a `` deep appreciation and affinity for the Gulf Coast '' . Mr Dudley joined BP in 1999 following a merger with Amoco and rose to the board last year . He is probably best-known for running BP 's joint venture in Russia , TNK-BP , during the public falling-out with its Russian partners .

Meanwhile a new US government estimate suggests the well leaked 4.9 m barrels of oil before being capped last month . The estimate would make it the largest accidental oil spill in world history . According to the new estimate prepared by the government 's Flow Rate Technical Group , BP was able to collect roughly 800,000 barrels of oil from the well in total . The well initially leaked about 62,000 barrels of oil per day , higher than any previous estimate of the flow . But as the well exhausted itself , the flow slowed to about 53,000 barrels per day . The spill totalled 205.8 million gallons . The flow ended on 15 July , when BP put a temporary cap on the well . BP hopes to begin its attempt to seal the well permanently with a `` static kill '' procedure on Tuesday . If the new estimates are correct , the spill would be greater than the 1979 Ixtoc I leak in the Gulf of Mexico , which gushed 3.3 million barrels . Only the intentional release of an estimated eight million barrels of oil into the Gulf by Iraqi troops during the Gulf War in 1991 was greater . BP has been using dispersant to break up the spilled oil , with the substance acting in a similar way to washing-up liquid . But amid concerns over dispersants ' long-term environmental impact , the Obama administration in May issued an order limiting their use . The study by the Environmental Protection Agency , released on Monday , showed the dispersant widely used in response to the oil spill in the Gulf , called Corexit 9500A , was `` generally no more or less toxic than the other available alternatives '' . `` The results indicate that the dispersant-oil mixtures are generally no more toxic to test species than oil alone , '' Paul Anastas , the EPA 's assistant administrator for research and development , told reporters . Concerns have been raised over the potential long-term effects of dispersant on marine life In a statement , EPA chief Lisa Jackson said : `` We have said all along that the use of dispersant presents environmental trade-offs , which is why we took steps to ensure other response efforts were prioritised above dispersant use and to dramatically cut dispersant use . '' The agency also said the use of dispersants had nearly halted since the well was capped on 15 July . On Sunday , the Washington Post reported that the US Coast Guard had granted BP 74 requests to use dispersants over 54 days on the Gulf surface and underwater , in spite of an administration order to limit their use . The paper found that the Coast Guard had granted every request to use the chemicals , although in some cases it had reduced the amount that could be deployed . In a letter released on Saturday , Democratic Congressman Edward Markey , chairman of the House energy and environment sub-committee , wrote that instead of complying with the EPA 's instructions , `` BP often carpet-bombed the ocean with these chemicals and the Coast Guard allowed them to do it '' . Last week , BP reported a record $ 17bn -LRB- # 11bn -RRB- loss , having set aside $ 32bn to cover the costs of the spill - the worst in US history . The spill may soon come to a permanent end , with BP preparing to inject mud and possibly cement into its blown-out well on Tuesday to seal it . Under the `` static kill '' procedure , the company will pump mud and cement into the well on Tuesday and Wednesday , if tests scheduled for Monday night yield positive results . The static kill , also known as `` bullheading '' , takes place in three stages . First , a test determines if oil can be pushed back down the well into the reservoir If that goes well , the static kill is begun by pumping in mud at low pressure . That may take all of Tuesday and possibly run into Wednesday Then , engineers will have to decide whether to pump in cement at the top of the well or wait and pump in cement from the relief well into the bottom of the damaged well .

If any leaks are detected during the procedure over the coming days , technicians will seek to identify them through seismic work and other diagnostic testing . During Sunday 's news conference , Mr Allen also defended the use of chemical dispersants by BP to break up oil slicks created by the spill , despite concerns expressed about their environmental impact . `` Sometimes there is no other way to attack the oil , '' he said , denying he had clashed with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency over the matter . `` There is no disagreement between Lisa Jackson and I regarding what we want to do with dispersants , '' he added .

A new government estimate suggests BP 's Macondo well leaked 4.9 million barrels of oil before being capped last month .

On Tuesday , BP started tests to establish how it can move to a procedure known as `` static kill '' . The tests - which will last several hours - were due on Monday but were delayed by a leak in a hydraulic line . The `` static kill '' will see heavy drilling fluid known as `` mud '' used to force the oil in the well back into the reservoir . It is likely to take between 33-61 hours , the US government 's incident commander Adm Thad Allen has said . Admiral Thad Allen : `` This thing wo n't truly be sealed until the relief wells are done '' A decision will then be made on whether the well can be immediately sealed with cement from the top .

It exceeds the 1979 Ixtoc I leak - also in the Gulf of Mexico . It 's comfortably bigger than tanker releases such as the Torrey Canyon and Amoco Cadiz , and 20 times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill with which it is often compared . Now that BP finally appears to have the flow under control , an important question - perhaps the most important of all - is being asked : it may have been the biggest , but was it the worst ? It is a simple-sounding question , but devilishly hard to answer . What impacts are we talking about - on the coast , on the ocean surface , or the sea floor ? Which species are we including - fish , shrimp , insects , plants , birds , whales , turtles - or some combination of them all ? Are we looking long-term or short-term , local or regional - and are we to include or exclude impacts from the use of chemical dispersants and fires and the other containment measures ? One thing that is clear is that different parts of the Gulf coast have seen very different levels of impact . Grasses in the wetland regions show damage - but they may recover Two weeks ago , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- announced that so little oil was being seen in a zone covering more than 26,000 square miles -LRB- 67,000 sq km -RRB- - a quarter of US territorial waters in the Gulf - that fishing could safely re-start . Yet in other areas , particularly along the coast , people are struggling daily to nurse oil-soaked birds back to health . Many commentators were saying during the early days of the episode that the ecological impacts would depend largely on the vagaries of winds and tides ; and so it has proven . Noaa has said that about three-quarters of the 4.9 million barrels leaked into the Gulf waters has already vanished from the area - through evaporation , capture , burning , or dispersion . But that still leaves more than a million barrels at sea . As a formerly significant US figure said in the context of a different Gulf : there are known unknowns , and unknown unknowns . Once it makes to it to shore it is causing an impact on our most sensitve ecosystem that is extremely difficult to clean up '' End Quote Paul Anastas EPA Andy Nyman , an associate professor of Wetland Wildlife Ecology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , has spent years conducting laboratory and field research into the possible impacts of oil spills on the coastal wetlands that are so vital as nurseries for fish and shrimp , nesting grounds for birds and as coastal defences . `` It 's going to be difficult to pick up the impacts of the oil spill and separate those from natural seasonal variability , '' he says . `` Impacts we 'll be looking for in the short term include the loss of wetland grasses and reductions in fish and other things that live in the water . `` In the longer term we could see reduced productivity in these populations , but we may not be able to detect it because the annual variations are quite large . '' He relates taking two trips along the coastal fringe in recent weeks . In one zone , they could see virtually no impact on the grasses . In the other , a stretch of coast about 10km -LRB- six miles -RRB- long showed significant damage , with swathes of grass brown and shedding leaves . Yet on many plants , new green stems were sprouting - just as happened on the grasses in Professor Nyman 's experimental plot after he had coated them in oil to see how they would perform . How the grasslands will fare in the long term is definitely a known unknown . Time 's lens will also reveal the impact on fish and shrimp , so vital to the local economy . But again , the stock varies naturally from season to season ; so picking out a specific impact of the oil leak could prove difficult . Out in the Gulf itself , the impact on bluefin tuna is potentially significant . The spawning grounds have been covered in oil at times , and there are fears that an entire year 's brood may be missing . But that will not become clear for several years . Estimating the marine impacts will also be complicated by the fact that closing the fisheries has given stocks a respite from nets and hooks . So how much do we know ? Several hundred thousand seabirds died from the Exxon Valdez spill - possibly as many as 600,000 , according to some estimates . By contrast , the number of birds found dead along the Gulf of Mexico coast is a little over 3,000 . Just over 500 sea turtles and 64 dolphins have also been found dead . But that is partly a function of the leak 's geography ; turtles would not have been affected by the Exxon Valdez simply because they do not frequent the coasts of Alaska . Conversely , the Exxon Valdez claimed the lives of several thousand sea otters - which do not live along the Gulf coast . Turtles are among the animals affected by the leak An important unknown - about which very little is known - is the importance of flows of oil deep underwater that were detected a couple of months ago and that almost certainly have dispersants mixed in . The use of these chemicals is controversial . They keep the oil away from shore - but the cost is paid in clogged wads of crude that sink to the sea floor . Paul Anastas , assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 's -LRB- EPA -RRB- Office of Research and Development , acknowleged that dispersants were far from perfect , but said their use here had been , on balance , positive . `` The purpose of the dispersants is to put the oil in a form that can be broken down and degraded by natural microbes , '' he said . `` Once it makes to it to shore it is causing an impact on our most sensitve ecosystem that is extremely difficult to clean up and has an extreme negative impact on the ecosystem of the Gulf . '' The EPA has just finished a batch of tests showing that dispersants mixed with oil are no more toxic to marine life in the Gulf than oil on its own - contradicting the claims of some critics . The Deepwater Horizon operation saw the injection of 771,272 gallons -LRB- 2,919,582 litres -RRB- of dispersant at depth , in addition to the 1,072,514 gallons -LRB- 4,059,907 litres -RRB- used on the surface . The impact of the deep water deployment is definitely an unknown unknown , as it has not been used on anything like this scale before . Expeditions are planned to investigate the impact on reefs , but they have yet to report . Other important investigations are going on into how quickly the oil is breaking down in the warm Gulf waters - something that should in principle happen much faster than in the icy conditions of Alaska 's Prince Edward Sound , or the Cornish seas where the Torrey Canyon spilt its cargo in March 1967 . That rate will have practical implications for the seabirds that will come to winter along the Gulf coasts - the piping plover , the blue-winged teal and the northern pintail - because it will largely determine how much oil will be there to greet them . Two decades on , the ecological impacts of Exxon Valdez are still being counted . And while the warmer Gulf waters are unlikely to take quite so long to settle , even a preliminary reckoning will have to wait until the first wintering birds have returned , shrimping boats have cast their nets again right across their grounds , and the wetland grasses have had a first chance to shed their oily carapaces and sprout anew in a fresh Spring .

So says Addison Wiggin , as the US government admits that nearly 75 % of all the oil leaked into the Gulf has already been removed . The average lake has higher concentrations of greasy suntan lotion from swimmers ... So everybody really ought to just calm down about it ... The Gulf shores will get cleaned up and big mother earth will do the rest . And John Polomny argues this is what rational people have been saying all along . Mike Thomas says he 's not pro oil but the subject 's close to his heart : Hyping environmental doom , as was done here , chisels away at the credibility of environmental issues . It 's the Cry Wolf syndrome . It also diverts attention from real issues , like the nutrients dumped into the Gulf from the Everglades . The threat of oil pales compared to this . Writing in Florida , Mike says : Pensacola Beach is beautiful . Blue crabs are having sex in the Louisiana marsh . Closed sections of the Gulf are once again open to fishing . The seafood is safe . And he argues the main damage to the coast has been from ` hysterical reports that scared away tourists and damaged the reputation of Gulf seafood ' . Most scientists agree ... that it 's far too early to write off the possibility of long-term consequences from releasing 210 million gallons of oil into the ocean . What 's more , it 's clear that even the good news ... only raises more questions about where the pollutants have gone . He suggests there could be a link between the BP oil spill and the Gulf Dead Zone , a massive area of water in the Gulf of Mexico that 's so deprived of oxygen it 's uninhabitable to sea life much of the year . And nearly 40 % of people in this online survey think the devastation from the oil spill has ` absolutely not ' been over-hyped . It 's certainly the biggest , but is the BP Gulf of Mexico the worst , or just the most ` over-hyped ' oil leak in history ? WHYS is a global conversation hosted by BBC News .

Meanwhile , BP 's relief well will reach the damaged well by the end of the week and start the final `` kill '' , the government 's incident commander said . An additional deposit of $ 2bn will be made in the fourth quarter by BP , with deposits of $ 1.25 bn being deposited each of the following quarters until the $ 20bn has been paid in full . `` The purpose of the escrow account was to assure those adversely affected by the spill that we indeed intend to stand behind our commitment to them and to the American taxpayers , '' BP 's incoming chief executive Bob Dudley said in a statement . Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli later said the justice department was `` pleased that BP made an initial contribution and has taken an important step toward honoring its commitment to the president and the residents and business owners in the Gulf region '' . The account will be overseen by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg , who managed compensation claims made by victims of the 9\\/11 attacks .

The investigation , carried out in June , shows a plume of crude oil-based chemicals up to 200m high and 2km wide , extending 35km from the spill site . The results are published in the journal Science . There had already been speculation that large quantities of oil from the spill remained dissolved in the sea at depth . This new research confirms that a plume , or cloud , does indeed exist below the surface . But it also shows that the amount is relatively small - possibly less than 0.1 % of the total amount spilled . Members of the research team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts , US , have been cautious about commenting on the significance of their study . Understanding how this plume is dispersing ... will determine how quickly deepwater fishing can resume in the Gulf '' End Quote Simon Boxall Southampton University Dr Chris Reddy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute , who was among those involved in the research , said he was unable to speculate , at this stage , what impact the plume would have on marine life in the area . `` I 'd -LRB- need -RRB- a much better inventory of all the molecules that make up the oil before -LRB- I could -RRB- start to get an idea , '' he said . Jane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , and one of the most senior scientists in the US , commented : `` We are all served best by proceeding in a careful , thoughtful , and quantifiable manner , where we can actually document everything and share it publicly . '' Marine experts said the US researchers ' study offered an important insight into the extent of the oil spill 's impact on the region 's marine ecology . Dr Simon Boxall from the University of Southampton , National Oceanography Centre , UK , said : `` This is actually an optimistic outlook and allays fears that huge plumes of oil lie in the deep ocean . '' Dr Martin Preston , an expert on marine pollution at the University of Liverpool , said that although the plume contained many toxic chemicals , they were at very low concentrations and at a depth where relatively few marine animals are found . Any concerns that oxygen would be depleted by the plume breaking up and creating so-called `` dead zones '' were unfounded , he added . `` Oil plumes are normally broken up by microscopic organisms in a process that uses up oxygen in the sea water , '' he said . `` If this happens rapidly , oxygen can reach dangerously low levels at the expense of marine animals . So the fact that the oil is breaking up slowly and moving away from the coastline is good news in the short-term . '' But the plume 's resilience means that there is also some bad news : the oil components are not degrading quickly and are likely to remain for several months or longer . Dr Benjamin Van Mooy , another principal investigator of the research team , said : `` If the oxygen data from the plume layer are telling us it is n't being rapidly consumed by microbes near the well the hydrocarbons could persist for some time . `` So it is possible that oil could be transported considerable distances from the well before being degraded . '' Dr Boxall said it would be important to continue monitoring the region . `` Understanding how this plume is dispersing and breaking down will determine how quickly deepwater fishing can resume in the Gulf , '' he said .

An investigation carried out by BP said it was responsible in part for the disaster , but it also blamed two other companies working on the well . However both firms criticised the report . BP faces billions of dollars worth of legal claims for compensation over the spill , the worst in recent US history . An estimated 4.9 m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf after the blast . The well was capped on 15 July , and an operation to permanently seal it is due to take place in the next few weeks . In the 193-page internal report released on its website , BP said that decisions made by `` multiple companies and work teams '' contributed to the accident , which it said arose from `` a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgements , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces '' . BP was leasing the Deepwater Horizon rig from Transocean , and its cement contractor was Halliburton . The BP report was critical of the processes and actions of teams from both firms . However , in a statement issued after the report , Transocean dismissed BP 's criticism , calling the company 's own well design `` fatally flawed '' . `` In both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk - in some cases , severely , '' the Associated Press reported Transocean as saying . Halliburton also criticised the BP report , saying that it had `` a number of substantial omissions and inaccuracies '' . `` Halliburton remains confident that all the work it performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP 's specifications , '' Cathy Mann , Halliburn 's director of corporate affairs , said in a statement . The report , conducted by BP 's head of safety , Mark Bly , highlighted eight key failures that , in combination , led to the explosion . BP said that both BP and Transocean staff incorrectly interpreted a safety test which should have flagged up risks of a blowout . It is in BP 's recommendations for change that many will see the real story '' `` Over a 40-minute period , the Transocean rig crew failed to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well '' which eventually caused the explosion . BP criticised the cementing of the well - carried out by Halliburton - and repeated previous criticism of the blowout preventer . Among the other findings , the report said : There were `` no indications '' that Transocean had tested intervention systems at the surface , `` as was required by Transocean policy '' , before they were deployed on the well `` Improved engineering rigor , cement testing and communication of risk '' by Halliburton could have identified flaws in cement design and testing , quality assurance and risk assessment A Transocean rig crew and a team described as `` mudloggers '' working for Halliburton Sperry Sun may have been distracted by what are described as `` end-of-well activities '' and , as a result , important monitoring was not carried out for more than seven hours Crew may have had more time to respond before the explosion if they had diverted escaping fluids overboard . `` To put it simply , there was a bad cement job and a failure of the shoe track barrier at the bottom of the well , which let hydrocarbons from the reservoir into the production casing , '' said outgoing chief executive Tony Hayward . `` The negative pressure test was accepted when it should not have been , there were failures in well control procedures and in the blowout preventer ; and the rig 's fire and gas system did not prevent ignition , '' he said . The blowout preventer that failed was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday and transported to a Nasa facility near New Orleans where it will be placed in the custody of the US Justice Department and examined . BP 's incoming chief executive Bob Dudley said the report proved that the explosion was `` a shared responsibility among many entities '' .

BP leased the Deepwater Horizon rig from Transocean , and its cement contractor was Halliburton . The BP report was critical of the processes and actions of teams from both firms . The report , conducted by BP 's head of safety , Mark Bly , highlighted eight key failures that , in combination , led to the explosion . BP said that both BP and Transocean staff incorrectly interpreted a safety test which should have flagged up risks of a blowout . `` Over a 40-minute period , the Transocean rig crew failed to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well '' which eventually caused the explosion . BP criticised the cementing of the well - carried out by Halliburton - and repeated previous criticism of the blowout preventer . Among the other findings , the report said : There were `` no indications '' that Transocean had tested intervention systems at the surface , `` as was required by Transocean policy '' , before they were deployed on the well `` Improved engineering rigor , cement testing and communication of risk '' by Halliburton could have identified flaws in cement design and testing , quality assurance and risk assessment A Transocean rig crew and a team described as `` mudloggers '' working for Halliburton Sperry Sun may have been distracted by what are described as `` end-of-well activities '' and , as a result , important monitoring was not carried out for more than seven hours Crew may have had more time to respond before the explosion if they had diverted escaping fluids overboard . `` To put it simply , there was a bad cement job and a failure of the shoe track barrier at the bottom of the well , which let hydrocarbons from the reservoir into the production casing , '' said outgoing chief executive Tony Hayward . `` The negative pressure test was accepted when it should not have been , there were failures in well control procedures and in the blowout preventer ; and the rig 's fire and gas system did not prevent ignition , '' he said . The blowout preventer that failed was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday . It will be placed in the custody of the US Justice Department and examined . BP 's incoming chief executive Bob Dudley said the report proved that the explosion was `` a shared responsibility among many entities '' . The company said it had accepted all the recommendations in the report , and would implement them worldwide . `` We are determined to learn the lessons for the future and we will be undertaking a broad-scale review to further improve the safety of our operations , '' Mr Dudley said in a statement .

Since the 20 April catastrophe there has been much discussion in US Congressional hearings and the media about the sequence of events that led up to it . Here is a summary of what we know so far about the BP oil spill , and the primary questions that are still being investigated . The Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling an oil well in the Macondo prospect that was intended to be plugged with cement and then completed later to become a production well . The top of the well was about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,524 m -RRB- beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico . The Deepwater Horizon was owned and mostly staffed by employees of exploration firm Transocean , under contract to BP . BOP : Blowout preventer - stack of valves designed to stop blowouts Blind ram shear : Last line of defense in BOP - cuts pipe Centraliser : Device to keep pipe or casing in center of well Cement bond log : Tests to make sure cement is sound Annulus : Gap between pipe and rock , or between pipe and another pipe Underwater oil wells are not just holes with a drilling pipe stuck into them . As the drilling is done , a fluid , usually mud is forced out of the drill bit and debris is thus pushed upwards . This fluid also counteracts the pressure to stop oil and gas forcing their way upwards . Once each passage of drilling is completed , metal casing is cemented into place in the hole . In this case the well had already been cemented ready for abandonment . At the point the disaster occurred , the well was essentially finished . How cement and casing is placed in drilling borehole Drill , lowered from rig , bores through seabed creating a borehole for sections of casing pipe to be lowered into Casing pipe is lowered into borehole allowing cement to be pumped down the pipe to fix it in place Once the cement is set and secure another stage of drilling begins In his evidence to a Congressional committee on 19 May , Transocean chief executive Steve Newman noted that the well was `` essentially complete '' with drilling having finished three days before the disaster on 17 April . He said : `` The one thing we do know is that on the evening of 20 April , there was a sudden catastrophic failure of the casing , the cement or both . Without a failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . '' Cementing issues being investigated by Transocean include the type of nitrogen-foamed cement used , the volume and the time it was allowed to `` cure '' . The BP investigation released on 8 September said data from the fateful day suggested that oil and gas had passed through the cement at the bottom of the well , through a device known as a `` shoe track '' and up the casing . The cement used was foamed with nitrogen . The BP team criticised providers Halliburton for doing `` inadequate lab tests '' on the cement mix . Much has been made in Congressional hearings of the number of centralisers used . These devices make sure that the pipe or casing is centralised during cementing , to ensure a good job is done . Congressmen say Halliburton recommended that 21 should be used , but BP decided only six should be used . In an e-mail , a BP engineer said : `` But , who cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine and we 'll get a good cement job . '' The BP investigation said the 15 centralisers were ready for use on the rig , but workers wrongly thought they were of a type that would have caused problems . They decided not to use them . This decision was wrong , but did not contribute to the disaster , the BP team said . Because of the importance of getting a good cement job in the well , one that is bonded both to the casing and to the geological formation in which the well is dug , a series of measurements called a `` cement bond log '' is usually run . A sonic scanning device is lowered through the well on a wireline . It checks whether there are imperfections in bonding or other problems in the cement . If there are , more cement can be squeezed into affected sections . Documents presented to Congress show a team from Schlumberger were called to the rig to be ready to do such work , but that they departed on the morning of the disaster having been told their services were not required . Other documents suggest the cost saving in not having a `` cement bond log '' to be about $ 118,000 . `` The cement bond log not being done at that point was n't a wrong choice , '' said BP investigation team leader Mark Bly . He did say that there should have been a `` risk assessment '' that might have included a cement bond log , but emphasised that it might not have spotted any problems . Another issue was the type of casing that would be used on the final , bottom section of the well . BP opted for a single line of casing from the seabed down to the bottom of the well , Congressman say . The more expensive option would have been to use a `` liner '' , a bit of casing hung from the bottom of the casing section above . Inside this would have been a further piece of tubing called a `` tieback '' . This arrangement would have created more barriers to the upward flow of oil and gas , but it would also have been more expensive . The BP team found that the suggestion that the firm used the wrong well design by not opting for a `` liner with tieback '' had no bearing on the disaster . This option would have guarded against oil flowing up the annulus , the space between the casing and the geological formation . But BP believes it went straight up the casing . BP 's investigation said it took 49 minutes after the first oil and gas flowed up the well before Transocean workers on the rig took action to control the situation . By extension , this suggests that they did not notice until that point that there was a big problem . `` It is also clear that the drill crew had very little , if any , time to react . The initial indications of trouble and the subsequent explosions were almost instantaneous . '' The surge of gas that reached the surface ignited . Transocean identified two nearby vessels , the rig 's own engines and some equipment as the possible source of the accidental ignition . BP 's investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of ignition . But their team did identify one crucial decision leading to the blast . A worker pressed a button to send the flow from the well to a device called a mud-gas separator , but the valves at various points in the system could n't deal with the pressure and failed . A cloud of gas was soon all over the ship . Instead , the gas and oil could have been sent overboard , but that still might not have stopped the gas igniting . This meant the sensors were active but the alarm would not actually sound , to avoid the crew being awoken at night . Transocean said the setup was standard practice and there were in any case hundreds of other alarms . In the blast and fire , 11 rig workers died , with more injured . Just over 36 hours later the rig sank . Whatever the exact cause of what happened , it is clear there was some sort of gas-kick and blowout resulting in an uncontrolled upward surge of oil and gas flow to the surface . The blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- is supposed to stop this happening . The BOP , the size of a five-storey building , consists of a series of high-pressure valves , designed to prevent such a surge or kick from damaging the drilling operation . In this particular BOP , built by US firm Cameron to specifications by Transocean , there are five ram-type preventers and two annular preventers , according to Transocean 's chief executive . The crew on the rig tried to close the BOP manually , but it failed . A `` dead man '' automatic trigger also failed . And subsequent attempts to close it using remote-operated vehicles did not work . Investigations into the US oil spill are focused on the blowout preventer system of valves on the seabed . The system 's control panel is its electronic `` brains '' , keeping valves open to allow flow from well to rig . In an emergency , hydraulic valves or shear rams should close shut on the pipe , sealing it and preventing flow . BACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Two possible scenarios have been discussed . One - suggested by Transocean - is that the kick was so catastrophic it pushed fragments of cement debris through the BOP so fast that it was damaged and could not activate . The sheer force of what happened is indicated by the fact that cement debris traveled all the way up the 5,000 ft of riser and on to the deck of the drilling rig . The other possibility is that the BOP was faulty in the first place . There were initial allegations that the batteries in a control pod for the BOP may have been flat . The BP investigation team said that one of the control pods did indeed have insufficient charge to activate the BOP . And the other pod had a faulty electrical coil and also could not work . Workers on the rig had tried to activate the BOP manually but cables from the surface had been damaged . The last line of defense in a BOP is usually the blind shear ram . This device , activated hydraulically , uses piston-driven blades to cut the pipe , thus stopping the flow . This did not work . One possible explanation that has been suggested is that the section of pipe it was trying to shear was a section of `` tool joint '' . These joints between the pipes are typically so strong that a blind shear ram can not deal with them . The BP probe said this was not the case . Another possibility is that something in the hydraulic mechanism of the blind shear ram had failed . The failed BOP was removed from the top of the damaged well on 2 September and brought to the surface two days later . It is now in the custody of the Deepwater Horizon Criminal Investigation Team and FBI Evidence Recovery Team and will be examined to determine what went wrong .

At the time of the explosion , 126 crew members were on the rig , 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana BP has revealed a number of key findings made during its internal investigation into who it believes was responsible for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Eleven people were killed and 17 people were injured in an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon on 20 April . An estimated 4.9 m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf after the blast . The report says no one action or inaction was behind the accident . Instead , `` multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time '' . It blames the combination of `` a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgements , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces '' . Transocean was responsible for the safety valve known as the blowout preventer . The report says six leaks were identified in its hydraulic system . While it was on the wellhead , the investigators say the preventer appeared to follow BP and Transocean 's standards . However , they say there were `` no indications '' that intervention systems had been tested at the surface , `` as was required by Transocean policy '' , before it was deployed on the well . The day before the accident , cement was pumped into the drill column of the well to prevent hydrocarbons entering it from the reservoir . The BP investigation says there were `` weaknesses in cement design and testing , quality assurance and risk assessment '' . It suggests that `` improved engineering rigor , cement testing and communication of risk '' by Halliburton could have identified those flaws . But the report also says the Houston-based BP staff at the site could have raised awareness of the problems . Transocean and BP -LRB- the well owner -RRB- A `` negative-pressure test '' was carried out to check the mechanical barriers . The report says that Transocean rig crew and BP leaders on the site `` reached the incorrect view '' that the test had been a success and the well was secure . The report says that the Transocean rig crew and a team described as `` mudloggers '' working for Halliburton Sperry Sun may have been distracted by what are described as `` end-of-well activities '' and , as a result , important monitoring was not carried out for more than seven hours . The crew `` underbalanced '' the well by pouring seawater into it rather than heavy-drilling mud . This allowed gases through the blowout preventer . For an estimated 40 minutes , the influx of gases into the well was apparently not spotted . By this time `` hydrocarbons were rapidly flowing to the surface '' and , according to witnesses , mud flowed uncontrolled on to the rig platform . The BP report says that if the blowout preventer had been closed and sealed around the drill pipe before that point , gases probably would not have entered the pipe known as the riser . The gases moved to areas of the rig where there was a greater risk of explosion . The heating , ventilation and air conditioning system `` probably transferred a gas-rich mixture '' into engine rooms on the Deepwater Horizon . The report says : `` The surface facilities were overwhelmed with the volumes of fluids and gas , which resulted in the explosions and fire .

Mr Hayward 's personal responses to the explosion , which killed 11 workers , have been criticised in the past . On a visit to Louisiana to view the spill 's damage , Mr Hayward had told reporters he `` wanted his life back '' . The Commons Energy Committee is questioning both Mr Hayward and BP 's head of safety , Mark Bly , on the firm 's attitude to safety . Asked whether BP paid sufficient regard to safety matters , Mr Hayward told the committee that over the past three years the company had made a major investment in safety , spending $ 14bn -LRB- # 9bn -RRB- and recruiting thousands of people . `` And it is undeniably the fact that because of all of that , this particular incident is so devastating to me personally because we have made an enormous amount of progress in that three-year period , '' he said . My Hayward 's demeanor was in contrast to when he faced a US Congressional committee , when he appeared crushed and evasive . He was then pilloried for failing to answer the committee 's questions . In a veiled reference to that hearing , Tim Yeo , the chairman of the energy and climate change committee , has warned his colleagues not to use Mr Hayward 's appearance for `` point scoring '' rather than serious inquiry . One issue the UK committee is considering is whether UK offshore oil safety rules need to be changed as a result of the Gulf of Mexico spill . My Hayward said no changes would be made to its # 12bn -LRB- $ 18.5 bn -RRB- investment in the North Sea energy fields . He told the panel : `` BP remains very committed to oil and gas exploration in the North Sea and intends to make absolutely sure all the lessons , in all the dimensions we have discussed today , are fully applied to everything we do in the U.K. '' Meanwhile , in the US on Wednesday , the interior department said it was set to require oil companies to plug 3,500 non-producing oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico , in an effort to prevent future leaks . The department will also require companies to dismantle 650 unused oil and gas platforms , some of which have sat idle for decades without inspection for leaks . On Wednesday , the Financial Times newspaper said offshore inspection records showed BP did not comply with rules about regular training for offshore operators on how to respond to an oil spill . Mark Bly told MPs the issue had been addressed : `` It is true a handful of people - less than 10 - had not undergone all the training , which was mostly a computer-based refresher . '' Mr Bly led an internal investigation by BP into the reasons for the explosion . It found BP was responsible in part for the tragedy , but also placed some blame on rig owner Transocean and cement contractor Halliburton . `` No single factor caused the accident , and multiple parties including BP , Haliburton and Transocean were involved , '' he said . Mr Hayward strongly denied cost-cutting was a factor in the Deepwater Horizon disaster , telling MPs that `` safety is the first call on every dollar BP invests . Before we invest in anything , we invest in safety '' . Mr Hayward will step down next month from the position of chief executive to be replaced by the man in charge of the Gulf clean-up operation , BP managing director Bob Dudley .

The Plaquemines Parish area was heavily affected by the spill . Ed Overton , an environmental scientist at Louisiana State University , said warm temperatures and a lack of wind can rob water of oxygen and in turn cause fish kills in late August and early September . But Mr Overton questioned whether the BP spill had played a role in the mass fish deaths . `` It is improbable , not impossible , that this is the result of oil toxicity , '' Mr Overton said . `` The oil that 's in the shoreline right now does n't have a lot of the volatile components .

The White House said decision-making must be `` fully informed '' by knowledge of any potential environmental consequences . BP announces that the total cost to it of the oil spill so far has reached $ 6.1 bn -LRB- # 3.8 bn -RRB- . The total includes the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , and cementing up of the damaged well . It also includes grants to the Gulf states hit by the spill and $ 319m paid out in compensation to some of those affected by the spill . The US government says three-quarters of the oil spilled in the Gulf has been cleaned up or broken down by natural forces . Meanwhile , BP reports `` encouraging '' progress with the `` static kill '' operation to plug the well with mud and seal it with cement . The US government says the oil spill is officially the biggest leak ever , with 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked before the well was capped last month . Scientists said only a fifth of the leaking oil - around 800,000 barrels - was captured during the clean-up operation . The US Environmental Protection Agency says in a study the dispersant used after the spill is no more toxic than oil alone . There had been concerns raised by congressional investigators that dispersant may have been more widely used than the government ordered . US scientists say the oil from the well has cleared from the sea surface faster than expected , 100 days after the disaster began . Mr Hayward will leave his post by October BP confirms that chief executive Tony Hayward will leave his post by mutual agreement in October , but he is likely to retain a position in the company . BP plans to nominate him as a non-executive director of its Russian joint venture , TNK-BP . Mr Hayward 's American colleague , Bob Dudley , who has taken charge of the clean-up operation , will replace him . Meanwhile , the oil giant 's second quarter earnings are published , showing losses of $ 17bn for the three months between April and June - a UK record . The company says it has set aside $ 32.2 bn -LRB- # 20.8 bn -RRB- to cover the costs linked to the Gulf of Mexico spill . The BBC reveals that 53-year old BP chief executive Tony Hayward will receive a year 's salary plus benefits , together worth more than # 1m , when he steps down . He will also be entitled to draw an annual pension of # 600,000 once he reaches the age of 55 . Ships involved in BP 's effort to secure the blown-out oil well prepare to resume work after a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico weakened . Coast Guard chief Adm Thad Allen says the storm put back efforts to drill a relief well by seven to 10 days . The rig drilling a relief well was ordered to leave the spill site ahead of Tropical Storm Bonnie Dozens of vessels , including the rig drilling a relief well to permanently block the damaged well , are ordered to leave the site as Tropical Storm Bonnie approaches . BP warns that the final operation to plug the well could be delayed by up to two weeks by the storm . The capped well is to remain unmonitored for several days . Meanwhile , BP says it has been given permission to prepare for a `` static kill '' - pumping mud into the top of the well through the new cap - a step viewed as an intermediate measure . The firm would need final approval from the US to carry it out . Adm Allen tells BP he is concerned about a `` detected seep '' on the sea floor near the well and other `` undetermined anomalies '' . He said that if methane was found to be seeping from the sea floor , oil might also be leaking . With the new cap in place , BP says it has temporarily shut off the oil flow in order to test the integrity of the well . President Barack Obama hails `` a positive sign '' . Adm Thad Allen says a relief well , which officials and BP have said is the only way permanently to plug the well , has come within 5ft -LRB- 1.5 m -RRB- of the leaking well bore . BP begins a bid to place a tighter-fitting cap atop the leaking wellhead . The company warns that oil will flow freely while the caps are being exchanged , but says it has brought in 400 oil-skimming ships to deal with the increased flow . The BBC 's Madeleine Morris says it may take days to complete the operation Oil from the spill reaches Texas , meaning it has affected all five US Gulf Coast states . But officials said it was unclear if the oil had drifted hundreds of kilometres from the leak site to the Texas shore , or had fallen from ships taking part in the clean-up operation . BP says the oil spill response has cost the company $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- , including the cost of containing the spill and cleaning up the oil , and the cost of drilling relief wells . The figure also includes $ 147m paid out in compensation to some of those affected by the spill . Many fishermen put out of work by the oil spill have taken jobs in the clean-up effort A federal judge blocks the Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , saying the ban can not be justified . The administration quickly issues another moratorium with revised terms . Meanwhile , BP hands day-to-day control of the response to Bob Dudley , replacing Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who had been widely criticised for his insensitive remarks on the spill . BP chief executive Tony Hayward receives a tongue-lashing at a hearing in the US Congress . Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , says BP 's `` complacency '' before the 20 April rig explosion was `` astonishing '' . BP announces it will place $ 20bn in a fund to compensate victims of the oil spill and says it will not pay a shareholder dividend this year . President Obama addresses the nation from the Oval Office , vowing , `` We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . '' Responding to complaints in the British media of an anti-British tone to his remarks , President Barack Obama tells UK Prime Minister David Cameron that his criticism of BP has nothing to do with national identity . The US Geological Survey estimates the oil flow at as many as 40,000 barrels per day before a cap was put on the well on 3 June . BP announces it is collecting 15,800 barrels per day from the well . Skimmers , including the giant `` A Whale '' , are cleaning oil from the surface Adm Thad Allen , the commander of the US response , says clean-up of the oil-stricken Gulf could take years . Meanwhile , President Obama says he has been consulting with experts so he can learn `` whose ass to kick '' in the matter . The US government says underwater oil plumes have traveled as far as 40 miles from the site of the leaking well . BP places a cap , called the `` lower marine riser package '' , atop the leaking wellhead . The cap allows the company to pipe much of the oil and gas leaking from the well to ships on the surface . President Obama takes a third trip to the region . The US announces a criminal inquiry into the BP oil spill . Carol Browner , President Barack Obama 's adviser on energy policy , says the spill is the worst environmental disaster in US history , worse even than the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . Obama visits the Gulf Coast again and declares `` the buck stops with me '' . BP prepares to plug the leaking well with heavy drilling mud , a procedure called a `` top kill '' . The attempt is declared a failure three days later . Oceanographers say oil from the leak has entered an ocean current - the `` loop current '' - that could carry it towards Florida and potentially up the US east coast . Pelicans are among the wildlife harmed by the oil Researchers who have analyzed underwater video from the leak site estimate as many as 70,000 barrels of oil are leaking into the Gulf per day , with a margin of error of plus or minus 20 % , significantly higher than earlier estimates . BP tries to thread a tube into the broken wellhead in an effort to collect some of the leaking oil in surface ships . Meanwhile , President Obama condemns the `` ridiculous spectacle '' of the companies trading blame while oil spews from the well . At a series of congressional hearings , BP , Transocean and Halliburton , the three companies involved in the Deepwater Horizon drilling operations , all blame each other for the disaster . BP officials weigh shoving debris , including golf balls and rubber tyres , into the leaking wellhead , a maneuver known as the `` junk shot '' . They also ready a `` top hat '' - a metal dome - to be placed over the leak . Meanwhile , BP reveals the oil spill has cost the company $ 350m -LRB- # 233m -RRB- so far . BP 's effort to place a giant metal box atop the leaking well to contain the spill fails when ice crystals accumulate inside the box and engineers are forced to remove it . Meanwhile , officials revise the estimate of the leak 's rate upward to 5,000 barrels per day . President Obama makes his first trip to the Gulf Coast and says BP is responsible for the leak and for paying for its clean-up . `` We 're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , '' he says . `` The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf states . And it could extend for a long time . It could jeopardise the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home . '' President Obama said he would ` spare no effort ' in responding to the crisis Oil from the leaking well begins washing ashore in Louisiana . Soon fragile coastal wetlands are inundated with thick , brown mud . President Barack Obama 's administration bans oil drilling in new areas off the US coast pending investigations into the cause of the BP spill . Before the spill , Mr Obama had said he would allow new offshore drilling . The US Coast Guard sets fire to patches of spilled oil in an effort to prevent the slick from reaching the vulnerable Louisiana coastal wetlands . President Barack Obama pledges `` every single available resource '' , including the military , to help in the response effort . The US Coast Guard warns the oil leak could become the worst oil spill in US history . In a reverse , officials reveal the well is leaking an estimated 1,000 barrels of oil per day and warn of environmental disaster . Meanwhile , BP sends undersea robots to the wellhead in an unsuccessful effort to activate the blowout preventer , a piece of heavy kit mounted on top of the well to stem the flow of oil . The Coast Guard says it had no indication that oil was leaking from the well 5,000 ft below the surface of the Gulf . The Deepwater Horizon sinks to the bottom of the Gulf after burning for 36 hours , raising concerns of a catastrophic oil spill . A Coast Guard official says the Macondo well , which the rig had been drilling , could be releasing up to 8,000 barrels of oil per day . An explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico , 52 miles -LRB- 84km -RRB- south-east of Venice , Louisiana , kills 11 workers . Operator Transocean , under contract for BP , says it had no warning of trouble ahead of the blast . The rig was drilling in about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,525 m -RRB- of water , pushing the boundaries of deepwater drilling technology . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

A pressure test showed a cement plug put in place by BP to permanently `` kill '' the well was holding . President Obama hailed the news , vowing to continue to help those affected . The worst offshore oil spill in US history began after the Deepwater Horizon rig blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers and later sinking . The top US federal official overseeing the disaster , Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen , said on Sunday that the well was now `` effectively dead '' . `` Additional regulatory steps will be undertaken but we can now state definitively that the Macondo Well poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico , '' Adm Allen said . A temporary cap had sealed the flow on 15 July while a relief well was dug . That well finally linked up with the ruptured well on Thursday , allowing workers to start pumping in the cement , removing the need for the cap and creating the permanent `` kill '' . The disaster has brought an environmental nightmare to hundreds of miles of US coast . It led to BP chief executive Tony Hayward standing down and the imposition of a moratorium on deepwater offshore drilling . In a statement , President Obama hailed Sunday 's `` important milestone '' and thanked all those who had `` worked around the clock to respond to this crisis and ultimately complete this challenging but critical step to ensure that the well has stopped leaking forever '' . The impact on the economy and wildlife has yet to be fully assessed He said he remained `` committed to doing everything possible to make sure the Gulf Coast recovers fully from this disaster '' . He added : `` This road will not be easy , but we will continue to work closely with the people of the Gulf to rebuild their livelihoods and restore the environment that supports them . '' The cost of the disaster to BP has been massive . It has created a compensation fund of $ 20bn and paid out another $ 8bn so far in the clean-up campaign . This final sealing will mean BP can leave the site and concentrate on dealing with the aftermath of the spill . At the beginning of August , the US government announced that almost three-quarters of the oil had been cleaned up or broken down by natural forces . The remaining quarter was thought to be `` degrading quickly '' . But more recent research noted an undersea plume of crude oil-based chemicals up to 200m high and 2km wide , extending 35km from the spill site .

This new figure is in good agreement with calculations produced by federal government advisers who used different estimation techniques . The Columbia University team reports its findings to the journal Science . They indicate the volume leaking from the well at one stage could have filled four Olympic-sized pools every day . Marine geophysicists Timothy Crone and Maya Tolstoy used a technique called optical plume velocimetry to study the oil escaping through the failed blowout preventer on the seafloor . The technique analyses the images from video footage to gauge the velocity of flowing fluids . It was originally devised by Dr Crone to study hydrothermal vents - volcanic areas in the deep ocean where super-heated waters are being spewed from cracks in the seabed . Velocimetry converts what is a flat , two-dimensional image in the video pictures into a volumetric flow rate . `` Using this optical image analysis method we can apply essentially a conversion factor for what the apparent motion is -LRB- in the video -RRB- and obtain what the average velocity is at the opening , '' explained Dr Crone . `` And if you know the average velocity at the opening , you can then multiply that by the area of the opening and that gets you the volume . The work relies heavily on laboratory experiments which we have used to calibrate this method , '' he told BBC News . One key assumption is the recognition that not all the plume seen in the video comprises oil . It is thought only 40 % of it does , with the rest being gas and water . For the Science study , the team assessed two short , high-resolution sequences of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil plume . The impact on the economy and wildlife has yet to be fully assessed One of these 20-30-second sequences was taken while the collapsed riser pipe was still connected to the well 's blowout preventer . The second sequence was taken after this riser pipe was cut and removed . Crone 's and Tolstoy 's analysis suggests that the average flow rate of oil from the well between 22 April -LRB- the day the Deepwater Horizon rig sank -RRB- and 3 June was 56,000 barrels per day . After the riser pipe was removed , the researchers say some 68,000 barrels of oil was flowing into the ocean each day , until the well was finally capped on 15 July . Their total spill figure is 4.4 million barrels . This number assumes constant flow rate and the subtraction of the 800,000 or so barrels BP managed to recover at the disaster site . The researchers stress their figures have a large uncertainty of perhaps 20 % , but they compare well with the 4.1 million barrels estimate produced by the federal government 's Flow Rate Technical Group -LRB- again , taking account of the 800,000 barrels recovered by BP -RRB- . Four-point-four million barrels is 185 million US gallons , or just over 700,000 cubic metres . To put it another way , the total volume is equivalent to about 280 Olympic-sized swimming pools -LRB- minimum specification -RRB- . The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and injured 17 By comparison , the volume lost from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska in 1989 , the largest previous US oil spill , amounted to 260,000 barrels . `` Our estimate should be viewed as preliminary , '' Dr Crone said . `` It was based on these two short clips . It 's sort of a proof of concept . What we 'd like to do in the future is apply this technique to more videos - if they can be made available - to get a better estimate of how the flow rate changed over time . This will help us narrow the uncertainties . '' Commenting on the research , Dr Simon Boxall , from the UK 's National Oceanography Centre , said the most important on-going issue remained not the size of the spill but its environmental impact . `` Whilst this may be the largest single marine spill of oil , it has not proven to be the most destructive , '' he explained . `` The depth of the spill , ocean conditions and the methods of coastal protection all helped to avoid catastrophic impact . Such research methods have an important application in identifying spill rates in determining best practice during an incident ; but post-spill , it is the fate rather than volume of oil that still needs attention . '' The federal government 's Flow Rate Technical Group estimated some 4.9 million barrels -LRB- see chart -RRB- came out of the well , with BP managing to capture only 800,000 barrels .

We think the UK can cope . The industry 's got to review things - they 'd be stupid not to . But we 've got the backbone of a good system '' End Quote Rob James Oil Spill Response On a vessel off Southampton , a group of oil managers , harbourmasters and port officials is coming face to face with the challenge of coping with a slick - part of a surge in training since the Deepwater Horizon blowout . Against a shoreline backdrop of vast BP oil storage tanks and the giant Fawley refinery , the class helps deploy a long stretch of heavy plastic boom - an exercise more relevant than ever as the oil companies drill in greater depths of ocean . The training is run by Oil Spill Response , a not-for-profit company funded with a budget of up to # 30m from the oil giants and several dozen others to provide expertise and resources to tackle accidents all over the world . The Gulf of Mexico leak sent shockwaves through the industry and led to calls for a moratorium on deep drilling . On Friday , the member states of the OPSPAR Commission - the countries with shorelines along the eastern Atlantic , including Britain - rejected proposals for a ban but agreed to review the rules for drilling in `` extreme conditions '' . With the Department for Energy and Climate Change considering plans for three deep wells off Shetland - one by BP and two by Chevron - the focus is on how effectively the UK could handle a spill . The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and injured 17 In its warehouses in Southampton and elsewhere , Oil Spill Response has about 16km of boom to protect shorelines , much of it packed and loaded on trailers ready for deployment - though in the Gulf of Mexico hundreds of kilometres of boom were used . About 1,500 tonnes of chemical dispersant is held by Oil Spill Response and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency , with several aircraft on standby to disperse it . Rob James , regional director of Oil Spill Response , says : `` We ca n't be complacent but we 've got the basic structure ready . `` We 're seeing more guys coming on training and that 's going to increase ; we 're having more enquiries to review contingency plans ; we 're getting more calls for exercises and we 're going to need more people . `` We think the UK can cope . The industry 's got to review things - they 'd be stupid not to . But we 've got the backbone of a good system . We 've got equipment here and elsewhere . '' The Gulf of Mexico spill has heightened awareness of the issues Throughout the industry , reviews are under way not just into what went wrong a mile underwater in the Gulf of Mexico but also into how to improve the chances of avoiding a similar calamity happening again . The key question raised by critics is that the oil industry was unprepared to cope with the impact of a blowout a mile deep and that future deep wells should not be drilled at least until the failings are better understood . The campaign group Greenpeace argues that plans for future deep wells in UK waters are courting disaster because current environmental assessments do not take account of the risks . Oil Spill Response has about 16km of boom ready to go to an incident Greenpeace protesters have climbed on to the anchor chain of the drilling ship Stena Carron off Shetland and its lawyers are considering seeking a Judicial Review into the government 's handling of the proposals for deep wells . Greenpeace 's Ben Ayliffe says : `` It 's irrational to rush ahead with deep water wells . Our worry is that there could be another catastrophic blowout and it could be incredibly difficult , nigh on impossible , to stop it . `` Whatever the governments say about the plans being robust , history has shown us time and time again that there always will be things like human error . And when you do that in ultra-deep waters like off the west of Shetland , the problems are magnified . '' The Department for Energy and Climate Change told the BBC there was no need for a moratorium because the UK 's regulatory system ensured the highest possible standards .

The report says that during the crucial first 10 days of the oil spill the government 's response `` seemed to lag '' - and that coastguard officials were `` overly-optimistic '' in believing BP could handle the incident .

His comments came in his first external speech since taking the helm of BP . Six months ago , the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , causing a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Central to attempts to rebuild BP 's reputation is the story about its efforts following the leak , Mr Dudley believes . `` The first thing to say is that we have stopped the leak and made huge progress in cleaning up the spill , '' Mr Dudley said . `` Second , our containment and clean-up efforts have gotten results . `` Third , we are meeting our commitments as a responsible party of this accident .

Mr Dudley was also eager to stress that BP was `` part of the American community '' , and that rather than pull out of the US , the company would get more deeply involved . After all , he said , BP was the largest producer of oil and gas in the US as well as a major employer , with 23,000 people on its payroll . `` I did not become chief executive of BP in order to walk away from the US . BP will not be quitting America , '' he said . BP could soon be back drilling in deep waters off the US coast , after Washington lifted a temporary moratorium , not least because the world will need more oil and gas , he reasoned . `` The deep waters are becoming an increasingly important source of energy to fuel the global economy , '' Mr Dudley said . `` And we are one of only a handful of companies with the financial and technological strength to undertake development projects in these difficult geographies . '' BP 's return may be controversial in the US , where many are still angry about the Gulf accident , but Mr Dudley is eager to reassure the American people . `` It can be done safely , '' Mr Dudley said . `` A silver lining of the event is the significant and sustained advance in industry preparedness that will now exist going forward , -LRB- including -RRB- the learnings and the equipment and techniques invested by necessity under pressure to contain the oil and stop the well .

Halliburton has denied the claims , saying the tests were invalid as they were on a different kind of cement . The 20 April blowout led to the worst environmental disaster in US history . Eleven workers on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig were killed by an explosion which followed , and hundreds of miles of coast were polluted . The well was finally capped on 15 July , after an estimated 4.9 m barrels of oil -LRB- 171m gallons -RRB- had leaked into the sea , and fully sealed last month . In a letter to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , its chief counsel Fred Bartlit said BP and Halliburton both had test results showing the foam slurry - created by injecting nitrogen into cement - used to seal the well before the blowout did not meet industry standards for stability . Halliburton carried out four separate tests . In three of them , the results showed the mixture to be unstable and potentially prone to failure . The fourth test produced more positive results , but these might not have been available by the time work on the well got under way on 19 April , Mr Bartlit wrote . Finally , Halliburton and BP both had results in March showing that a very similar mix to the one pumped into the Macondo well would be unstable . Halliburton does not believe that the foam cement design used on the Macondo well was the cause of the incident '' `` But neither acted upon that data , '' Mr Bartlit wrote . `` Halliburton -LRB- and perhaps BP -RRB- should have considered redesigning the foam slurry before pumping it at the Macondo well . '' Halliburton later issued a statement saying it believed there were significant differences between its own tests and those performed by the commission . `` The commission tested off-the-shelf cement and additives , whereas Halliburton tested the unique blend of cement and additives that existed on the rig at the time Haliburton 's tests were conducted , '' it said . The company also denied any suggestion that it knowingly used a potentially defective product , suggesting that the failed internal tests were invalid because the cement mixture was different from the one eventually used in the well . However , the last-minute changes demanded by BP meant that the final cement mix was not tested fully , it admitted . Earlier statements by the company had said tests had shown the cement to be stable . Halliburton also criticised BP for not performing a cement bond log test , which checks the cement is secure after it has been pumped down the well , or properly interpreting the negative-pressure test . The oil spill devastated wildlife along the Gulf Coast `` Given these numerous intervening causes , Halliburton does not believe that the foam cement design used on the Macondo well was the cause of the incident . '' The BBC 's Iain MacKenzie in Washington says the oil spill commission 's findings go some way to supporting BP 's own investigation , which found failings in the composition of the cement . However , the full report has yet to be published and at this stage the investigators stop short of apportioning blame , our correspondent says . Mr Bartlit also noted shortcomings by Transocean , which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig on behalf of BP . `` Because it may be anticipated that a particular cement job may be faulty , the oil industry has developed tests , such as the negative pressure test and cement evaluation logs , to identify cementing failures . It has also developed methods to remedy deficient cement jobs , '' he wrote . `` BP and\\/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well , '' he added .

The previous loss reflected the massive costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill crisis , which followed an explosion on a drilling rig in April . BP said the cost of the oil spill had now risen by $ 7.7 bn to $ 39.9 bn . Bob Dudley , who led the clean-up , became BP 's chief executive last month .

BP has benefited from a higher oil price , which boosted earnings in its giant exploration and production division by more than $ 2bn , offsetting a fall in the amount of oil produced . That division is being broken up , as part of comprehensive efforts by the new chief executive Bob Dudley to rehabilitate this battered business . His cure also includes shrinking BP , selling off up to $ 30bn of assets by the end of the year , to cover those huge oil spill costs . The news was well received by the markets , which sent the company 's share price up more than 1 % by early afternoon . `` The update provides a stark reminder that the fallout from the spill will follow BP for some considerable time to come , '' said Richard Hunter , head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers . `` In the meantime , BP has refocused itself with safety as a priority and , in terms of its normal operations , the company continues to generate enormous amounts of income .

In his first interview since resigning Tony Hayward said as the face of BP he had been `` demonised and vilified '' , but he understood why . The blast on 20 April killed 11 workers and caused one of the worst environmental disasters in US history . It took five months for the well to be completely sealed . BP was widely condemned for its slow response to the leak , which pumped out around half a million barrels of oil in to the gulf during the first month . Every day crude oil was still leaking into the ocean , US anger towards BP mounted . The world looked to BP 's leader Mr Hayward for reassurance that the spill would be stopped as quickly as possible to limit the environmental and financial damage .

I 'd probably still be the CEO of BP '' End Quote Tony Hayward BP 's former chief executive But he said it was hard to cope under such intense scrutiny . He told BBC Two 's Money Programme special , BP : $ 30 Billion Blowout : `` BP 's contingency plans were inadequate . We were making it up day to day . `` What was going on was some extraordinary engineering . `` But when it was played out in the full glare of the media as it was , of course it looked like fumbling and incompetence . '' By the end of May , the company 's best hopes of plugging the leak rested on pumping heavy drilling fluid down the well - in an operation known as top kill . `` I remember being in the control room in Houston , '' said Mr Hayward . `` The whole team had assembled , we were all watching the charts , listening to the read-out , and there was an incredible feeling of hope . '' But the top kill attempt failed . `` If we 'd been successful in killing the well in the first week of June , then so many things would 've been different . `` Not least I 'd probably still be the CEO of BP , '' he said . But Mr Hayward 's personal remarks and actions enraged residents of the Gulf coast and US politicians .

I 'm not certain I 'd do anything different '' End Quote Tony Hayward Former BP chief executive Two months into the disaster Mr Hayward was called to a hearing in Washington where he was grilled over his handling of the operation . Two days later , Mr Hayward was seen on a yacht off the Isle of Wight where his son was taking part in a yacht race , which made headlines around the world as a publicity own-goal . He was criticised by President Obama 's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , who said the boating incident has `` just been part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes '' . `` To quote Tony Hayward , he 's got his life back , '' he said . But for the first time Tony Hayward defended his move to take some time off , and said he would do it again . `` I have to confess , at the time I was pretty angry actually . `` I had n't seen my son for three months , I was on the boat for six hours ... I 'm not certain I 'd do anything different . `` I wanted to see my son , '' he told the program . President Obama , who was extremely outspoken about Mr Hayward , continually reassured the American public that the cost of the clean-up and compensation would fall to BP . This photo thought to be of Tony Hayward during the crisis , sparked angry criticism of his leadership `` The emotion , and anger and frustration was entirely understandable actually , '' Mr Hayward said . `` The US administration had n't created this mess , we had . '' Despite the criticism , Mr Hayward said that the blame was justifiable . `` I do n't feel like I 've been made a scapegoat , I recognized the realities of the world we live in . `` In some senses it comes with the patch and you simply have to take the rough with the smooth . '' He reflected that his comments about the spill and the reaction to them , contributed to the anger towards him . `` If I had done a degree at Rada -LRB- The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art -RRB- rather than a degree in geology , I may have done better , but I 'm not certain it would 've changed the outcome , '' he said . `` But certainly the perception of myself may have been different .

Fred Bartlit challenged congressional claims during his presentation to the seven-member National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , countering allegations that BP had made disastrous choices to save millions of dollars .

Criticism of the disaster has sprung in part from decisions made over the design of the BP well , which used a single pipe , known as a `` long string '' , that ran from the sea floor to the bottom of the well . Among the commission 's preliminary findings , released on Monday , was that there was `` no evidence at this time to suggest that there was a conscious decision to sacrifice safety concerns to save money '' . `` We see no instance where a decision-making person or group of people sat there aware of safety risks , aware of costs , and opted to give up safety for costs , '' Mr Bartlit said in his presentation . He added : `` We do not say everything done was perfectly safe . We 're saying that people have said people traded safety for dollars . We studied the hell out of this . We welcome anybody who gives us something we missed . '' But Mr Bartlit did say BP had left some important information out of its investigation into the disaster , which unleashed more than 200m gallons -LRB- 757m litres -RRB- of crude oil into the Gulf . He added that there were areas where the panel 's probe would conflict with BP 's findings . The commission 's 13 key points focused on tests done to check the cement used in the well , decisions made by BP when plugging the well and the actions of those at the company in the hours before the disaster aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig . BP and Transocean treated negative pressure tests as a `` complete success '' , the report says , adding that laboratory data should have prompted a redesign of the cement slurry . Once the crew on the rig recognized there was a problem , there were `` several options that might have prevented or delayed the explosion '' , another key point states . The report goes on to say that BP incurred `` additional risk '' through certain procedures . Despite the critiques by the commission , some groups feel the investigators could have come down harder on the oil giant . Daniel Becnel , a Louisiana lawyer who is suing BP , said the new findings were `` absolutely absurd '' . `` They are pasting over because they know the government is going to be a defendant sooner or later in this litigation , '' Mr Becnel said . Billy Nungesser , the president of Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana , also challenged the panel 's findings . `` Why cut corners if it is not for money ? '' Monday 's presentation kicked off a two-day hearing that is due to include reaction from BP , Transocean and Halliburton , the contractor which did the cement job on the Macondo well .

The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11 workers and polluted hundreds of miles of coast . Mr Reilly called for `` top-to-bottom reform '' at the companies involved in the well , known as the Macondo well , and faulted a `` sweep of bad decisions '' by the three companies . At a meeting on Tuesday of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , investigators , witness and panel members said BP was hurried and could have operated more safely if it had taken time to acquire necessary material and kit .

The panel had previously said the cement used to seal the well may have contributed to the blow-out that caused the explosion , and said the two companies had test results showing the cement was unstable . Mr Reilly 's remarks came a day after the panel 's chief investigator said he had found no evidence BP had made risky decisions in order to save money . Paul Adams BBC News , Washington Back in the summer , the narrative was clear : BP was in such a hurry to finish the well that it cut corners , chasing profits above everything . No longer is BP being singled out . Transocean and Halliburton , BP 's two main collaborators , are also in the firing line . White House investigators say they have yet to discover a single example of an individual action which put profit before safety . But the same panel has suggested that commercial pressures played an important role in the disaster . While BP executives can perhaps take some comfort from the fact that the president 's own investigators agree with about 90 % of the company 's internal findings , the oil giant is hardly being let off the hook . In any case , members of the panel have already made it clear that they are less interested in apportioning blame than identifying lessons to improve the safety of deep-water drilling .

For the first time in my life , I had oysters for breakfast Pelicans swooped by in formation , low and effortless , and a pair of dolphins raced just ahead of the bow , daring each other to get closer and occasionally rolling sideways to check we were suitably impressed . We were less than 100 miles -LRB- 160 km -RRB- from the wreck of the Deepwater Horizon but everything looked pristine under a blazing sun . As big as the palm of my hand , succulent and briny . It was still early and so , for the first time in my life , I had oysters for breakfast . But the atmosphere aboard the boat was sombre . The oysters were good but hardly plentiful . At this , the season of peak demand , far too many were simply dead . Oyster supplies are down following measures taken to disperse the oil Not , as you might think , coated in sticky oil or even poisoned by chemical dispersants but killed off , as luck would have it , by fresh water . Millions of gallons from the Mississippi River were hurriedly diverted into the bays and marshes of the delta to keep the oil from rolling in , earlier in the year - but this upset the delicate balance of fresh and salty conditions the oysters need to survive . Nick Collins is a fourth generation oyster-man , with a rich gumbo of an accent to match . His business had only just recovered from the ravages of Hurricane Katrina , five years ago , and Nick was looking forward to a bumper year . But if the first setback was an act of God , the second was an act of industry - an industry that is much bigger and more commercially important to Louisiana than Nick 's delicious oysters , an industry that sits off this fragile , mysterious landscape of channels and marshes , and produces the stuff that Americans really can not get enough off . At nearby Port Fouchon beach , the shallow-water rigs , tens of them , sit as little as a mile offshore . Clean-up teams are still scooping up tar from the beach Oil arrived here in the weeks after the spill and BP 's clean-up continues . Armies of contract workers , mostly from Central America , make their steady , painstaking way along the sand . Wave after wave of them , in bright yellow boots , stooping slightly over shovels and brushes , scooping up tiny tar balls , covered in sand . They pause , scour the patch in front of them and then - to the sound of `` Vamonos ! '' -LRB- `` Let 's go ! '' -RRB- - move on a few paces . Not all the oil is from the Macondo well . Studies show that some of it comes from elsewhere , perhaps from the rigs we can see , perhaps even from the natural seepage that goes on all the time in the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico - and which has , over the eons , created an army of microbes that like nothing more than to feast , like Pac-Men , on energy-rich hydrocarbons . He was confident , as everyone was , that it was just a matter of time before the oysters reappeared and everyone was happy again Organisms that just might clean up whatever muck lurks out of sight , all by themselves . So the clean-up is not just about the Deepwater Horizon but about every company that has ever sought to make a fortune extracting the black stuff and bringing it ashore . BP , it seems , is making amends for all of us . But back to the oysters and another family business struggling with the fallout . On the edge of New Orleans ' legendary French quarter , the P & J Oyster Company has been in business for more than 130 years . Like Nick Collins , Al Sunseri wonders if he has what it takes to recover . The ice which gushes noisily into his giant coolers every eight minutes has very little to cool and the high , whitewashed-stone shucking tables are deserted . The Exxon Valdez ran aground off Alaska spilling 11m gallons of oil He has laid off all but two temporary workers who keep a trickle of customers happy with oysters from nearby Texas . Al also had to deal with Katrina , downsizing and waiting for the oyster beds to replenish themselves . He was confident , as everyone was , that it was just a matter of time before the oysters reappeared and everyone was happy again . But now he wonders about his son , who has experienced depression and has not been working for a couple of months . He says he remembers his own anxiety as a young man , taking over a business with such a long tradition to uphold . He thinks about Alaska and the herrings that disappeared from Prince William Sound three years after the Exxon Valdez spill , never to return . More than seven months after the blowout on the Deepwater Horizon , the full ramifications of this disaster are still hard to gauge . The uncertainty gnaws at everyone who depends on the sea . Is it possible , they wonder , that the worst days may still lie ahead ? How to listen to : From Our Own Correspondent BBC Radio 4 : Saturdays , 1130 .

BP said it would continue to co-operate with government inquiries and fulfil its commitments to clean up spilt oil in the Gulf . Halliburton , the company that cemented the Macondo well , and Cameron International , which provided equipment for the well , were not targeted in the lawsuit . Andy Gallacher BBC News , Miami Barack Obama called the oil spill America 's environmental 9\\/11 . It was a catastrophe on such a huge scale that he addressed the American people from the Oval Office for the first time in his presidency . During that address , he promised US citizens that they would not have to foot the bill for the clean-up and that those responsible would be brought to justice . It was a militaristic speech that talked of battle plans and a greener future . It also set the tone for an administration that was determined to make BP and others pay for this country 's biggest environmental disaster . This lawsuit will be the start of a long road of litigation that could last for years and cost BP and others dearly . Criminal probes are still under way and there is the potential for thousands of class-action lawsuits . But for many , who depend on the oil industry for their livelihood , there has long been a desire to put this accident behind them and get back to work . But the justice department said on Wednesday that the investigation into the oil spill was ongoing and that more defendants and charges could be added to the lawsuit . Mr Holder did not specify a timetable for legal proceedings , instead saying the US would move as quickly as possible in the matter . Transocean disputed the charges brought by the government , saying that it should not be held liable for the actions of others . `` No drilling contractor has ever been held liable for discharges from a well under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , '' the company said in a statement . `` The responsibility for hydrocarbons discharged from a well lies solely with its owner and operator . '' Before the White House 's announcement on Wednesday , more than 300 lawsuits had been filed related to the spill and consolidated in federal courts in New Orleans . People working in the fishing and tourism industries , as well as the owners of restaurants and various properties along the Gulf of Mexico , were among those involved in the suits . The latest news on the BP oil spill follows the federal government 's decision not to open new areas of the coast along the eastern Gulf and Atlantic to drilling . Eleven workers on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig were killed by the explosion on 20 April , and hundreds of miles of coast were polluted before the leaking well was closed off in July .

Though it lacked subpoena power , the panel reviewed thousands of pages of documents , interviewed hundreds of witnesses , and in the autumn conducted a series of public hearings .

The oil spill was an avoidable disaster caused by a series of failures and blunders made by BP and its partners , including Transocean and Halliburton , and government departments assigned to regulate them , the panel concludes . It also warns such a disaster would likely recur because of industry complacency . BP internal report -LRB- September 2010 -RRB- BP admits its managers on the oil rig could have prevented the catastrophe had they picked up warning signs of a breach of the cement seal at the bottom of the well , as well as unusual pressure test readings , shortly before the explosion .

Chemical Safety Board investigation into regulatory approaches to offshore industry Joint inquiry by the US Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management National Academy of Engineering analysis In a months-long investigation , the panel found that mistakes and `` failures to appreciate risk '' compromised safeguards `` until the blow-out was inevitable and , at the very end , uncontrollable '' . BP 's `` fundamental mistake '' , the panel wrote , was failing to exercise proper caution over the job of sealing the well with cement . `` Based on evidence currently available , there is nothing to suggest that BP 's engineering team conducted a formal , disciplined analysis of the combined impact of these risk factors on the prospects for a successful cement job , '' the report reads . The conclusions run counter to industry efforts to portray the Deepwater Horizon disaster as a rare occurrence , as oil companies prod the US government to open greater areas of the US coast to oil exploration . `` The blowout was not the product of a series of aberrational decisions made by rogue industry or government officials that could not have been anticipated or expected to occur again , '' the report read . `` Rather , the root causes are systemic and , absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies , might well recur .

They also warned that taxpayers could pay for a major spill in the North Sea . But they said a moratorium on deep sea drilling would undermine the UK 's energy security and is unnecessary . Energy Minister Charles Hendry `` welcomed '' the report and said he would consider its recommendations in detail . The report came as a US presidential commission found that decisions to cut costs and save time had contributed to last year 's BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico . It added that the failures were `` systemic '' and likely to recur without industry and government reform . In the UK report , MPs singled out the `` harsh conditions '' off the west coast of the Shetland Islands in Scotland , where oil wells are being drilled more than 1,000 metres deep . There were `` serious doubts '' about the ability of clean-up equipment to function in such an environment , it added . Committee chairman Tim Yeo said : `` The harsh and windy conditions in the North Sea would make an oil spill off the coast of Shetland very difficult to contain or clean up '' . David Shukman with the `` top hats '' used by BP to help seal oil leaks The report also warned that a lack of clarity surrounding liability rules in the UK `` could see taxpayers pick up the tab for a major oil spill in the North Sea '' . And Mr Yeo questioned the response plans currently in place at oil exploration firms , saying that these must be site-specific and not generic . `` Companies can not continue producing cut and paste oil spill response plans and rig operators must make it easier for staff to raise concerns without fear of intimidation , '' he said . The MPs said the commercial pressures to keep on drilling were so great that workers who drew attention to safety problems `` may be - or feel - intimidated by their managers '' . They also noted contradictions in Health and Safety Executive reports about bullying and harassment on oil rigs . Mr Hendry said the government welcomed the committee 's `` thorough and comprehensive report '' . `` We note in particular that the committee supports the government 's view that a moratorium on UK deepwater drilling is not warranted . '' Industry body Oil & Gas UK also welcomed the report 's finding that a moratorium was unnecessary . `` We also warmly welcome the committee 's utter rejection of calls for increased regulatory oversight from the European Commission , '' added the group 's chief executive Malcolm Webb . He told the BBC that the industry had made `` gigantic strides '' in being prepared for an accident - and that the UK now had the equipment to cap a well . And addressing the concerns of the report about firms ' ability to deal with problems off the Scottish coast , he added : `` The industry is working to develop a capping device which can be deployed in the rough waters west of Shetland . '' Mr Webb also questioned the concerns of MPs over whether oil firms would be able to afford the clean up operations in the event of a spill - saying that it was clear companies were liable to cover costs , meaning that taxpayers or the government would not lose out . `` The regulator has all the powers to ensure that the oil companies are carrying all the requisite insurance , '' he added . However , the report was not universally praised . Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said : `` This report lists all the reasons why a ban on deep sea drilling makes sense and then ignores its own findings '' . `` The oil companies have no idea how they would deal with a major spill off the coast of the UK but apparently we 're supposed to trust them until they come up with an adequate plan .

Here are some key excerpts from their findings . The well blew out because a number of separate risk factors , oversights , and outright mistakes combined to overwhelm the safeguards meant to prevent just such an event from happening . But most of the mistakes and oversights at Macondo -LRB- well -RRB- can be traced back to a single overarching failure - a failure of management . Better management by BP , Halliburton , and Transocean would almost certainly have prevented the blowout by improving the ability of individuals involved to identify the risks they faced , and to properly evaluate , communicate , and address them . The Macondo well blowout was the product of several individual missteps and oversights by BP , Halliburton , and Transocean , which government regulators lacked the authority , the necessary resources , and the technical expertise to prevent . The blowout was not the product of a series of aberrational decisions made by rogue industry or government officials that could not have been anticipated or expected to occur again . Rather , the root causes are systemic and , absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies , might well recur . What we ... know is considerable and significant : -LRB- 1 -RRB- each of the mistakes made on the rig and onshore by industry and government increased the risk of a well blowout ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the cumulative risk that resulted from these decisions and actions was both unreasonably large and avoidable ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the risk of a catastrophic blowout was ultimately realized on April 20 and several of the mistakes were contributing causes of the blowout . Federal regulations did not address many of the key issues - for example , no regulation specified basic procedures for the negative pressure test used to evaluate the cement seal or minimum criteria for test success . Whether purposeful or not , many of the decisions that BP , Halliburton , and Transocean made that increased the risk of the Macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time -LRB- and money -RRB- . Some of the risky decisions taken by the companies involved include : Halliburton not fully reporting the results of tests on the foam cement used to seal the well until after the blowout , including ones that suggested that the mixture might have been unstable . The failure by BP to use 15 additional centralisers to stabilise the well instead of six , as recommended , which are critical to a good cementing job . The failure to properly conduct and interpret the negative-pressure test was a major contributing factor to the blowout . It was not necessary or advisable for BP to replace 3,300 ft -LRB- 1,006 m -RRB- of mud below the mud line with seawater , which placed more stress on the cement job at the bottom of the well than necessary . The drilling crew and other individuals on the rig missed critical signs that a kick -LRB- an unplanned influx of gas or fluids -RRB- was occurring . The crew could have prevented the blowout - or at least significantly reduced its impact - if they had reacted in a timely and appropriate manner .

The Arctic contains vast stores of methane , and its release could quickly accelerate warming around the world . But scientists caution that the regions are very different . The research ship Pisces , operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- , made several voyages into the Gulf in the months following the leak . `` There were thousands of different types of molecule coming out of the well , and by far the most abundant was methane , '' said research leader John Kessler , from Texas A and M University . `` In fact , by weight , 30 % of it was methane . `` Normally we have to go around and study what 's seeping naturally out of the sea floor ; but this release was massive and localized . '' Virtually all of the methane remained suspended and dissolved in sea water at depths of around one kilometre . Bacteria in the water that have evolved to process naturally-seeping methane apparently increased in number , taking oxygen from the water as they did so , and mopping up the Deepwater Horizon 's cargo . The team 's calculations indicate that less than one hundred thousandth of the gas released made it into the atmosphere . Methane is the second most important gaseous component of the man-made portion of the greenhouse effect . The Gulf waters were sampled for methane And vast quantities of it - no-one knows how much , though some estimates put it as 3,000 times the current amount in the atmosphere - lie trapped in the sea bed around the Arctic . There are other deposits around the world as well . Some see this methane hydrate as a potential future energy source . Others fear that if it escapes as the seas warm , it will act to amplify global warming . In principle , the Deepwater Horizon research could help inform scientists about how serious methane releases could be - how much would be processed in sea water , and how much would make it into the atmosphere . We do n't know the distribution of the methane hydrates - we do n't know how pervasive they are in the region '' End Quote Professor Graham Westbrook Birmingham University `` In the Arctic , there definitely would be some sort of microbial response ; and in most places on the sea floor that have the capacity for massive release , there will be some seepage that will help to populate the water with microbes that could respond , '' Dr Kessler told BBC News . However , he cautioned , there are big differences between the Gulf of Mexico leak and potential methane sources in the Arctic . Ed Dlugokencky , who runs Noaa 's global registry of methane concentrations but was not involved in the Gulf research , agreed . `` The implications of this work for release of methane from hydrates likely only applies to deep waters , not areas where hydrates exist on shallow continental shelves such as the East Siberian Arctic shelf , '' he said . `` There , water is only about 40m deep , and bubbling is an important mechanism for transport of methane from the sediments to the atmosphere . '' The shallower the water , the less time methane would spend in it , making absorption less likely . Temperature , currents and the types of bacteria present could be other factors important in determining how much makes it into the atmosphere . However , Dr Dlugokencky noted that evidence of vast , rapid releases of methane from the sea floor has not been seen in ice-core records , which now trace Earth history back about 800,000 years . Methane can escape from hydrates on or under the sea bed , and bubble to the surface ; higher temperatures may exacerbate the problem Research ships make regular cruises to the Arctic and have regularly found evidence of methane bubbling into the atmopshere . But , said Professor Graham Westbrook from the UK 's University of Birmingham , there is still a lot of basic science to be done . `` We do n't know the distribution of the methane hydrates - we do n't know how pervasive they are in the region , '' he said . `` And in places like the shelf areas north of Siberia , where releases have been found , it 's not clear how much of this is coming from the sea bed and how much is brought into the sea by rivers . `` Also , we do n't know how much of the releases we see are down to anthropogenic warming in the last couple of centuries , and how much relates to the natural warming we 've seen since the end of the last Ice Age .

The news came as a committee of UK MPs raised `` serious doubts '' about Britain 's ability to combat oil spills from deep sea rigs .

The report , by a US presidential panel , has said failures of BP were `` systemic '' - and were likely to happen again unless there were reforms in the oil industry . Perhaps most damningly , the chapter of the report detailing the circumstances of the actual explosion is headed with this quote from an internal BP email : `` But , who cares , it 's done , end of story , -LRB- we -RRB- will probably be fine and we 'll get a good cement job . '' However , from BP 's perspective , the key phrase in the report may be that the disaster was due to `` multiple causes and multiple companies . '' Certainly , it 's what they have emphasised in their reaction to the report 's findings . BP 's shares took a big jump as a result of the report . So has BP got away with it ? The essence of the report is that BP 's key fault was in its lack of `` adequate controls '' aimed at ensuring the engineering on the rig was `` safe and sound . '' There 's certainly a sense from some that BP should be suffering more as a result of this , summed up by Arbolioto on Twitter : `` The entire board and top management of BP should resign after presidential report on Gulf of Mexico oil spill . '' Charlie Krenock of Greenpeace told BBC News this morning that `` at the last minute ... they ignored their own recommendations , '' adding that `` the real answer is to stop chasing every last drop of oil ... chasing supply is going to continue to lead to problems . '' But on Facebook , Thabale points out that : `` Time saving & cost cutting are n't always a bad thing , its just the manner in which they are done and its a good thing they 've acknowledge that other parties were also involved ; at the end of the day , I would say BP deserved the share price rise . '' And on the Daily Telegraph , RiskManager argues that the line that Deepwater Horizon was the biggest environmental disaster in history is `` a hysterical Obama lie , '' and that the damage has largely disappeared . If that is the case , has enough already been done - and has BP been punished enough ? WHYS is a global conversation hosted by BBC News .

The panel also said the US needed to expand and update drilling regulation and establish an independent drilling safety agency . The April blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 people and caused one of the worst oil spills in history . The Macondo well , about a mile under the sea 's surface , eventually leaked millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf , damaging hundreds of miles of coastline before it was capped in July . The findings came in the final report of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , which President Barack Obama convened in May to investigate the root causes of the spill and recommend changes to industry and government policy . The report spreads blame for the disaster widely , criticising BP , which owned the Macondo well ; Transocean , which owned the rig ; and Halliburton , which managed the well-sealing operation . The oil spill was an avoidable disaster caused by a series of failures and blunders made by BP and its partners , including Transocean and Halliburton , and government departments assigned to regulate them , the panel concludes . It also warns such a disaster is likely to recur because of industry complacency . BP internal report -LRB- September 2010 -RRB- BP admits its managers on the oil rig could have prevented the catastrophe had they picked up warning signs of a breach of the cement seal at the bottom of the well , as well as unusual pressure test readings , shortly before the explosion . But it places much of the blame on Transocean and Halliburton . Chemical Safety Board investigation into regulatory approaches to offshore industry Joint inquiry by the US Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management National Academy of Engineering analysis It said the companies had cut corners to save time and money - decisions that contributed to the disaster . `` Our exhaustive investigation finds that none of the major aspects of offshore drilling safety - not the regulatory oversight , not the industry safety standards , not the spill response practices - kept pace with the push into deep water , '' said panel co-chairman William Reilly . Former Florida Senator Bob Graham , who sat on the panel , said the investigation showed the disaster was `` preventable and foreseeable '' , and described a shared `` failure that was years in the making '' . `` Federal government oversight utterly failed to provide an acceptable level of protection for those on the rig and for the Americans who call the Gulf their home , '' Mr Graham said in a statement . Mr Graham cited `` significant errors and misjudgements '' from BP , Halliburton and Transocean . increasing budgets and training for the federal agency that regulates offshore drilling increasing the liability cap for damages when companies drill offshore dedicating 80 % of fines and penalties from the BP spill to restoration of the Gulf lending more weight to scientific opinions in decisions about drilling The BBC 's Paul Adams , in Washington , says William Reilly was at pains to emphasise that last year 's spill was not a freakish , one-off event , but rather part of a much wider problem . The report 's authors want the companies to raise their safety standards , in order to restore the confidence of the American people in the safety of offshore drilling , our correspondent says . The commission 's recommendations include plenty of talk about tougher regulation . In Congress , where Republicans who traditionally mistrust federal regulation now control the House of Representatives , it 'll be interesting to see how lawmakers decide to act , our correspondent adds . In a statement on Tuesday , BP said it supported the commission 's efforts to boost industry-wide safety measures . `` We are committed to working with government officials and other operators and contractors to identify and implement changes that will enhance safety practices throughout the oil and gas industry , '' it said . Last week , the commission released an advance chapter of its report which said the firms involved had made decisions to cut costs and save time that contributed to the spill . It said that the decisions , even if inadvertent , had significantly increased the risk the Macondo well would blow out . `` BP did not have adequate controls in place to ensure that key decisions in the months leading up to the blow-out were safe or sound from an engineering perspective , '' the report found .

As part of the deal Rosneft will take 5 % of BP 's shares in exchange for approximately 9.5 % of Rosneft 's shares . It is BP 's first deal since the Deepwater Horizon spill last year , which cost it billions . The BP shares stake is worth just under $ 8bn -LRB- # 5bn -RRB- . `` BP executives see this as the first piece of good news since that disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico last April , '' said the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston . But he said the deal was a controversial one , with Russia not seen as an entirely transparent society nor as a stable place to do business . `` This unique agreement underlines our long-term , strategic and deepening links with the world 's largest hydrocarbon-producing nation , '' said BP 's chief executive Bob Dudley . Robert Peston Business editor , BBC News For BP executives it 's a hugely exciting moment - the first bit of what they see as seriously good news since that devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico last April . For BP what matters is that the area of the Russian Arctic to be explored has the potential to produce as much oil as the North Sea in its heyday . But the deal will be hugely contentious . First Russia is widely viewed as not a desperately stable environment for Western businesses . Second it involves Rosneft , Russia 's biggest oil company , taking a 5 % stake in BP worth just under # 5bn . Rosneft is 75 % owned by the Russian government . So it will look to many as though the Russian government is taking a 5 % stake in a company with strategically important oil reserves all over the world , including - of course - the US . He said the `` historic '' deal would `` create value , deliver growth , and meet the world 's demand for energy '' . Mr Dudley said the agreement would meet the needs of consumers , shareholders and governments . The firms will explore in three areas - known as EPNZ 1,2,3 - on the Russian Arctic continental shelf . The areas covers 125,000 square kilometres in an area of the South Kara Sea . `` Our future joint venture will utilize the experience and expertise of BP , one of the leaders in the global oil and gas industry , '' said Rosneft 's President , Eduard Khudainatov . `` This project is unique in its complexity and scale both for Russia and the global oil and gas industry . We see it as the next step in developing our relations with BP . '' Referring to the Deepwater Horizon blast Mr Dudley said that the firm had `` learned many lessons over the past year '' . He also said the Russian deal had not been precipitated by the backlash it had experienced in the US because of the Gulf of Mexico spill . We are creating an entirely new strategic alliance between what I know are two great companies '' End Quote Bob Dudley BP chief executive Since the rig disaster in the US Gulf of Mexico BP has been disposing of assets . Mr Dudley is the former chief executive of Russian joint venture TNK-BP , and was forced out of the country in 2008 after falling out with other shareholders . But he said he was pleased to now be working with Rosneft in `` one of the world 's last remaining unexplored basins '' . `` We are today building a relationship between BP and Rosneft that has been forged over 12 years but going far beyond anything that has gone before , '' he said . `` We are creating an entirely new strategic alliance between what I know are two great companies . '' UK Energy Secretary Chris Huhne : '' It 's a ground-breaking deal '' BP and Rosneft have also agreed to set-up an Arctic technology center in Russia which will work with Russian and international research institutes to develop technologies for the extraction of hydrocarbon resources from the Arctic shelf . UK Energy Secretary Chris Huhne hailed the agreement as a groundbreaking development . `` From what we know , it sounds like it 's potentially good for BP , '' said Phil Weiss , analyst at New York equities firm Argus Research . `` BP gets access to resources , Rosneft gets access to expertise and knowledge . '' However in the US Congressman Edward Markey , who is leading Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee , called for a review of the deal by US regulators . BP had a terrible 2010 with the Gulf of Mexico spill , which is going to cost them at least $ 40bn . But in November BP announced it was back in profit in the three months to September after last quarter ' s record loss . The firm said its replacement cost profit for the period was $ 1.85 bn -LRB- # 1.15 bn -RRB- , as against the $ 17bn loss recorded from April to June . The previous loss reflected the massive costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill crisis . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

The deal to exploit potentially huge oil and gas deposits in Russia 's Arctic shelf is the first for BP after both its profit and reputation were hit by the disaster at the Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico last year . `` In spite of the Macondo experience , and at the same time because of it , BP is betting that its relationship with the Russian government , which has often been fraught with problems , will now be its savior , '' says IHS Global Insight 's senior energy analyst Andrew Neff . Alexander Nazarov , senior analyst at IFC Metropol , believes that BP has become something of `` an outcast '' among the leading global energy firms as a result of the oil spill , which has already cost it billions of dollars . Valery Nesterov , an oil and gas analyst at Troika Dialog , says that there have been attempts to force BP out of the US energy market in the aftermath of the spill . Rosneft has used the situation to negotiate a much better share swap deal with BP than it would have been able to do before the spill , experts say . Mr Nazarov believes that Rosneft managed to get at least a 25 % bigger BP stake as a result of last year 's troubles for BP . BP will take 9.5 % of Rosneft 's shares , bringing the stake it owns in the Russian company to 10.8 % , in exchange for 5 % of its own shares . BP 's recently acquired experience in dealing with the oil spill could have played an important role in why Russia chose the company as its partner to exploit the Arctic shelf . The market value of BP fell as a result of the oil spill Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin quoted the Russian proverb `` one beaten is worth two unbeaten '' , when speaking of BP 's problems in the Mexican Gulf . Experts also name other factors that helped BP become Rosneft 's partner , including BP 's experience in developing its Alaska offshore oil drilling project and the company 's eight-year presence in Russia through TNK-BP . In 2003 , BP and the AAR Consortium , representing a group of Russian oligarchs , created the joint venture , which now accounts for a quarter of BP 's output . But in 2008 , Bob Dudley , who was then TNK-BP 's head , had to leave the post and the country as a result of a conflict between BP and the Russian oligarchs . Now Mr Dudley is BP 's chief executive and , according to a BP spokesman quoted by Reuters , he discussed the BP-Rosneft deal with one of the oligarchs on Thursday , one day before it was officially announced . Russian business papers have quoted Stan Polovets , head of the AAR Consortium , as saying that AAR lawyers are looking into whether the Rosneft-BP deal violates TNK-BP 's shareholders agreement . Mr Polovets says that under the agreement , both AAR and BP must get involved in any new project in Russia exclusively through TNK-BP , unless one of the partners refuses to participate in the project . But experts doubt that there will be a new public shareholders conflict in TNK-BP this time . One of the reasons is that TNK-BP lacks expertise in offshore oil drilling , Mr Nesterov says . In turn , Mr Nazarov says that Rosneft and TNK-BP have a good record of successful cooperation in a number of projects in Russia . Russia 's oil industry requires huge investment for the country to remain a leading oil producer , but the Russian investment climate makes many potential investors worry .

Watch the next program on Saturday , 29 January at 0330 GMT and 1830 GMT and on Sunday , 30 January at 1130 GMT and 1830 GMT . Last year , ConocoPhilips decided to sell its stake in Russia 's Lukoil , while E. ON Ruhrgas sold a Gazprom stake . And while the reasons for the sales might be unrelated to the general investment climate in Russia , they were seen by many as another example of investors ' fears . Seen in this perspective , the Rosneft-BP deal gives the Russian government a chance to show that the climate is not as bad as some critics say . As Mr Dudley put it : `` It 's my hope that you will see this step of cooperation with Rosneft as a very strong signal from BP in our confidence in the investment climate in Russia . '' But the shadow of Yukos , once a giant oil company owned by Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky , could create troubles for both Rosneft and BP . After the oligarch found himself behind bars and the company went bankrupt in 2004 , Rosneft bought its main asset . As a result , Yukos shareholders are suing Russia in the European Court of Human Rights , seeking $ 98bn -LRB- # 62bn -RRB- . `` BP shareholders should be concerned that once again the company has invested in a deal with Rosneft in assets over which there is a significant question as to security of Rosneft 's ownership , '' said Claire Davidson , who represents the former Yukos shareholders . Meanwhile , the former Yukos lawyer , Robert Amsterdam , believes that BP is taking a serious risk placing trust in the Russian officials . `` It is impossible to imagine a scenario in which the two companies -LRB- Rosneft and BP -RRB- have a dispute that is not artificially resolved in favor of Rosneft and its owners in the government of the Russian Federation , '' he wrote in his blog . On the other hand , experts say that there are some risks in the deal for Rosneft as BP shareholder . Financial services firm JP Morgan estimates that the total fine for BP could reach $ 69bn if the company is charged with gross negligence over the Mexican Gulf oil spill . According to estimates , BP and Rosneft will be required to invest up to $ 2bn in the first stage of the Arctic project - seismic testing and drilling wells . Mr Putin said last week that Russia 's Arctic offshore might hold 5bn tonnes of oil resources and 10 trillion cubic metres of gas . `` These are serious figures that need further confirmation , but they are quite realistic and I hope that these estimated resources will become proven reserves , '' said Mr Putin . If his words come to be true and the two sides manage to remain on good terms with each other , both BP and Rosneft could get a huge prize for what is seen by some as a gamble .
