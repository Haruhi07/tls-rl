Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success , also hit out at those behind the violence , which has cost more than 200 lives over the past few days , according to human rights groups . He said protests against his father 's rule , which have been concentrated in the east of the country , threatened to sink Libya into civil war and split the country up into several small states . Saif al-Islam also acknowledged -- in the first such admission by a Libyan official -- that the police and army made mistakes in dealing with the protests . But he said reports of hundreds killed were an exaggeration . He said the General People 's Congress , Libya 's equivalent of a parliament , would convene on Monday to discuss a `` clear '' reform agenda , while the government would also raise wages . -LRB- Reporting by Souhail Karam ; Writing by Christian Lowe ; Editing by Jon Boyle -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1", "dct": "2011-02-21", "dates": ["2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-22", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-20", "2011-02-20", "2011-02-20", "2011-02-20", "2011-02-11", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-18", "2011-02-20", "2011-02-20", "2010-12-01", "1969-01-01"], "text": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . Full Article Gaddafi son warns of civil war as turmoil spreads Credit : Reuters\\/Libyan TV via REUTERS TV TRIPOLI | Mon Feb 21 , 2011 3:51 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi will fight a popular revolt to `` the last man standing '' , one of his sons said on Monday after protests broke out in the capital for the first time following days of unrest in the city of Benghazi . Anti-government protesters rallied in Tripoli 's streets , tribal leaders spoke out against Gaddafi , and army units defected to the opposition as in a revolt that has cost the lives of more than 200 people . A major government building in the capital was on fire on Monday morning , a Reuters reporter said . The building is where the General People 's Congress , or parliament , meets when it is in session in Tripoli . The eastern city of Benghazi , where the protests began last week after the arrest of a human rights lawyer and where scores of people have been killed by security forces , was said by some residents to be effectively in the hands of the protesters . Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared on national television in an attempt both to threaten and calm people , saying the army would enforce security at any price to put down one of the bloodiest revolts to convulse the Arab world . `` Our spirits are high and the leader Muammar Gaddafi is leading the battle in Tripoli , and we are behind him as is the Libyan army , '' he said . `` We will keep fighting until the last man standing , even to the last woman standing ... We will not leave Libya to the Italians or the Turks . '' Wagging a finger at the camera , he blamed Libyan exiles for fomenting the violence . But he also promised dialogue on reforms and wage rises . A Tripoli resident , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters the streets of the capital were calm early on Monday morning . There was no sign of police , which is unusual for the city . He said that late on Sunday night anti-Gaddafi protesters had been replaced by his supporters , who rallied in the center of the city around Green Square until about 5 a.m. -LRB- 0400 GMT -RRB- . `` After Saif al-Islam 's speech , the pro-Gaddafi people , especially the youth , were touring the streets , particularly in the center , cheering Gaddafi . These people stayed up the whole night , they were marching all night , some driving in cars . `` They were in Green Square and along Omar al-Mokthar street . I would say there were hundreds , '' he said . `` I talked to someone near the square where the clashes were taking place and he told me it was quiet and they -LRB- anti-government demonstrators -RRB- have now departed . `` Last night during the rioting there were police around and they were shooting into the air . But after that there have been no police around , '' added the Tripoli resident . Saif al-Islam 's cajoling may not be enough to douse the anger unleashed after four decades of rule by Gaddafi -- mirroring events in Egypt where a popular revolt overthrew the seemingly impregnable President Hosni Mubarak 10 days ago . `` People here in Benghazi are laughing at what he is saying . It is the same old story -LRB- on promised reform -RRB- and nobody believes what he says , '' a lawyer in Libya 's second city told the BBC after watching the speech . `` He is liar , liar , 42 years we have heard these lies . '' In Benghazi , protesters appeared to be largely in control after forcing troops and police to retreat to a compound . Government buildings were set ablaze and ransacked . `` Security now , it is by the people , '' the lawyer said . `` Youths with weapons are in charge of the city . There are no security forces anywhere , '' University of Benghazi professor Hanaa Elgallal told Al Jazeera International television . Salahuddin Abdullah , a self-described protest organiser , said : `` In Benghazi there is celebration and euphoria . People are ecstatic about the situation . Right now it is calm . The city is no longer under military control . It is completely under demonstrators control . '' He told the TV network that protesters were trying to establish order by creating self-rule committees to run the city and distribute basic foodstuffs . European Union foreign ministers will condemn the repression of anti-government protests in Libya at their meeting later on Monday , according to the draft of a joint statement . France said the international community must do everything it can do prevent Libya sinking into civil war . The United States said it was weighing `` all appropriate actions '' in response to the unrest . `` We are analyzing the speech ... to see what possibilities it contains for meaningful reform , '' a U.S. official said . Libya 's ambassador to India told the BBC he was resigning in protest at the violent crackdown that has killed more than 200 . Ali al-Essawi also accused the government of deploying foreign mercenaries against the protesters . The Turkish Foreign Ministry said that around 3,000 Turkish citizens had applied to be repatriated from Libya since Friday and the first plane was sent to Benghazi on Sunday morning , with more planes to be sent once permission was granted . But CNN Turk reported that one Turkish Airlines plane had returned without landing amid reports that the airport had been taken over by opposition protesters . It was unclear if this plane was the same as the one mentioned by the foreign ministry . In the first sign of serious unrest in the capital , thousands of protesters clashed with Gaddafi supporters . Gunfire rang out in the night and police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators , some of whom threw stones at Gaddafi billboards . South Korea said hundreds of Libyans , some armed with knives and guns , attacked a South Korean-run construction site in Tripoli , injuring at least 4 foreign workers . Human Rights Watch said at least 223 people have been killed in five days of violence . Most were in Benghazi , cradle of the uprising and a region where Gaddafi 's grip has always been weaker than elsewhere in the oil-rich desert nation . Habib al-Obaidi , a surgeon at the Al-Jalae hospital , said the bodies of 50 people , most of them shot , were brought there on Sunday afternoon . Two hundred wounded had arrived , he said . Members of an army unit known as the `` Thunderbolt '' squad had brought wounded comrades to the hospital , he said . The soldiers said they had defected to the cause of the protesters and had fought and defeated Gaddafi 's elite guards . The Libyan uprising is one of series of revolts that have raced like wildfire across the Arab world since December , toppling the long-time rulers of Tunisia and Egypt and threatening entrenched dynasties from Bahrain to Yemen . The West has watched with alarm as long-time allies and old foes have come under threat , appealing for reform and urging restraint . Support for Gaddafi , the son of a herdsman who seized power in 1969 , among Libya 's desert tribes was also waning . The leader of the Al-Zuwayya tribe in the east threatened to cut oil exports unless authorities halted `` oppression of protesters '' . Libya is Africa 's fourth biggest oil exporter , producing 1.6 million barrels of oil a day . Oil jumped by more than $ 1 a barrel to $ 103.5 a barrel on fears the unrest could disrupt supplies . Some foreign oil companies were withdrawing small numbers of expatriate staff . -LRB- Reporting by Tarek Amara and Christian Lowe ; additional reporting by Brian Love and Daren Butler ; writing by Angus MacSwan ; editing by Giles Elgood -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "130", "dct": "2011-02-21", "dates": ["2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-20", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-21", "2011-02-11"], "text": "TRIPOLI | Mon Feb 21 , 2011 11:52 pm GMT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi fought an increasingly bloody battle to hang on to power on Monday when protests against his 41-year rule struck the capital Tripoli after days of violence in the east .

This would be a really serious threat . `` I am very concerned about the idea of dividing Libya in two ... that would be very dangerous .

Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam said in an address on state TV the army stood behind his father as a `` leader of the battle in Tripoli '' and would enforce security at any price . His comments were the first official reaction from the Libyan authorities since the unrest began . As he spoke , police used tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters in Tripoli , where gunfire was heard , vehicles were on fire and protesters threw stones at billboards of Gaddafi , who is facing the most serious challenge to his four-decade rule . Revolutions which deposed the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt have shaken the Arab world and inspired protests across the Middle East and North Africa , threatening the grip of long-entrenched autocratic leaders . In the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain , thousands of protesters gathered in a square in Manama , calling for political change and awaiting promised talks with the island 's Sunni rulers . After days of violence , the mood among the mainly Shi'ite protesters appeared to be more conciliatory . Libya , however was witnessing the bloodiest episodes yet in two months of unrest convulsing the Arab world . A resident in Tripoli told Reuters by telephone he could hear gunshots . `` We 're inside the house and the lights are out . There are gunshots in the street , '' he said . `` That 's what I hear , gunshots and people . I ca n't go outside . '' An expatriate worker said : `` Some anti-government demonstrators are gathering in the residential complexes . The police are dispersing them . I can also see burning cars . '' Al Jazeera television said thousands of protesters clashed with supporters of Gaddafi in Tripoli 's Green Square . The violence spread to Tripoli after days of protests in Benghazi , Libya 's second largest city , in which at least 233 people have been killed , according to Human Rights Watch . Communications are tightly controlled and Benghazi is not accessible to international journalists , but the picture that has emerged is of a city slipping from the grasp of security forces in the biggest challenge to Gaddafi 's rule since the `` brotherly leader '' seized power in a 1969 military coup . Habib al-Obaidi , head of the intensive care unit at the main Al-Jalae hospital in Benghazi , said the bodies of 50 people , mostly killed by gunshots , had been brought there on Sunday afternoon . The deaths came after scores were killed on Saturday . Two hundred people had arrived wounded , 100 of them in serious condition , he said . Members of an army unit known as the `` Thunderbolt '' squad had come to the hospital carrying wounded comrades , he said . The soldiers said they had defected to the cause of the hundreds of thousands of protesters in the streets and had fought and defeated Gaddafi 's elite guards . `` They are now saying that they have overpowered the Praetorian Guard and that they have joined the people 's revolt , '' another man at the hospital who heard the soldiers , lawyer Mohamed al-Mana , told Reuters by telephone . A Libyan tribal leader threatened to block oil exports to the West within 24 hours if the government does not stop the `` oppression of protesters . '' Another tribal chief told al Jazeera Gaddafi had to leave the country . Saif al-Islam , who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success , said the protests threatened to sink Libya into civil war and split the country . He said reports of hundreds killed were an exaggeration , but acknowledged the police and army made mistakes in dealing with the protests . The General People 's Congress , Libya 's equivalent of a parliament , would convene on Monday to discuss a `` clear '' reform agenda , while the government would also raise wages , in an apparent attempt to address some of the protesters ' demands , he said . The clamor for reform across a region of huge strategic importance to the West and the source of much of its oil began in Tunisia in December . The overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali then inspired Egyptians to rise up against strongman Hosni Mubarak , overthrowing him on February 11 . The tide has challenged Arab leaders , including many who have long been backed by the West as vital energy suppliers and enemies of Islamist militants . While each uprising has its own dynamics , from religion to tribalism , all protesters seem united by frustration over economic hardship and a lack of political freedom under entrenched elites . Unrest also hit Yemen , Tunisia , Morocco , Oman , Kuwait , Algeria and Djibouti over the weekend as people took to the streets demanding political and economic change . In Iran , thousands of security personnel deployed in the streets of Tehran and other cities to prevent protesters rallying in spite of a ban , opposition websites said . The United States said it was `` gravely concerned '' by the situation in Libya and warned its citizens to delay trips there . In Bahrain , the main opposition party said it wanted the crown prince to show signs of addressing opposition demands before any formal dialogue could start . Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa , of the ruling Sunni Muslim dynasty , made conciliatory moves after days of violence in which at least six people died . `` All political parties in the country deserve a voice at the table , '' he told CNN . `` I think there is a lot of anger , a lot of sadness ... We are terribly sorry and this is a terrible tragedy for our nation , '' said the prince , who is seen as a reformist . Ibrahim Mattar , a lawmaker of the main opposition Wefaq party , said protesters , thousands of whom were camping out in Pearl square , wanted more than words . `` We are waiting for an initiative from him , with a scope for dialogue , '' he said , adding that the prince should `` send a small signal he is willing to have a constitutional monarchy . '' Shi'ites , who make up 70 percent of the population , complain of unfair treatment in Bahrain , an ally of the United States , whose Fifth Fleet is based there . The opposition is demanding a constitutional monarchy that gives citizens a greater role in a directly elected government . It also wants the release of political prisoners . Speculation was growing that Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa , in office since independence from Britain in 1971 , would be replaced by the crown prince . In Tunisia on Sunday , security forces fired into the air as tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered downtown to call for the replacement of the interim government -- a sign that problems are not all swept away with the removal of a dictator . In Yemen , shots were fired at a demonstration in the capital Sanaa on the ninth consecutive day of unrest . Thousands were demanding the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who called for dialogue with the opposition . But the coalition of main opposition parties said there could be no dialogue with `` bullets and sticks and thuggery , '' or with a government `` which gathers mercenaries to occupy public squares ... and terrorise people .

Even if he flees -- assuming he could find a refuge -- Gaddafi would leave a nation with few normal structures for a peaceful transition , after four decades of his idiosyncratic rule . `` Any post-Gaddafi period is fraught with uncertainty , '' said Middle East analyst Philip McCrum . `` There is no organized opposition , there are no civil institutions around which people could ordinarily gather . `` The opposition in exile is small and disparate . It will therefore take a long time for a new political order to establish itself and in the meantime , political tensions will run high as various competing groups , such as the tribes , the army , Islamists and liberals vie for power . '' Dozens of people were reported killed in Libya overnight as anti-government protests reached the capital , Tripoli , for the first time . Several eastern cities appeared to be in opposition hands . The revolt has already cost more than 200 lives . Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , one of the mercurial leader 's sons , appeared on state TV overnight , mixing threats with appeals for calm , saying the army would enforce security at any price . `` We will keep fighting until the last man standing , even the last woman standing , '' he said , waving a finger at the camera . McCrum said Saif al-Islam 's speech had probably scotched any hopes among young Libyans that he could be a force for reform . The uprising in Libya already looks set to be the bloodiest in a series of popular protests racing across the Middle East from Algeria to Yemen . Possibilities for compromise look slim . `` Libya is the most likely candidate for civil war because the government has lost control over part of its own territory , '' said Shadi Hamid , of the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar . `` Benghazi was lost to the opposition and there are reports of other smaller cities going the same way . It is not something the Gaddafi regime is willing to tolerate . '' Benghazi , a city in eastern Libya -- the region that is home to most of the country 's oilfields -- is a traditional hotbed of anti-Gaddafi sentiment among tribes hostile to his rule . As the protests have snowballed , Islamic leaders and once-loyal tribes have declared for the opposition . Saad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer who for years defended Libya in the Lockerbie airline bombing case , said Gaddafi must go . `` I 'm sure he has armed to the teeth his own tribesmen and those tribes linked to him . I 'm sure he will be also giving them as much cash as possible , '' Djebbar told Reuters . He said Gaddafi had narrowed the circle of his power to his close family and tribe in recent years , alienating allies and tribes who had backed him after he seized power in 1969 . `` Gaddafi will go down fighting and Libyans will butcher each other . It 's a fight to the bitter end . If he activates the tribal card , it will only turn Libya into another Somalia . '' Djebbar said Western powers should consider protecting any rebel-held areas such as eastern Libya by using air power to bar Gaddafi from bombing his foes into submission -- similar to the no-fly zone they set up in Iraqi Kurdistan after the 1991 Gulf War to deter Saddam Hussein from reasserting control there . `` Gaddafi is like a cornered animal -- when threatened he attacks ferociously , '' said McCrum . `` Throughout his rule , he has shown no qualms in brutally suppressing any opposition . `` He is highly unlikely to make any concessions and if he goes down , he will take as many people with him as possible , '' he added , predicting that events in Libya `` will only get bloodier . '' McCrum said he doubted the army would turn on Gaddafi or emulate the role played by the military in facilitating the departure of long-serving autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia . `` The army will not actually effect regime change as in Egypt . They will simply perpetuate the status quo to protect their own interests , '' he said , noting that main arms of the security services were controlled by sons of Gaddafi . Libya , once a pariah accused of sponsoring international terrorism , rehabilitated itself by paying compensation to victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other attacks , and by renouncing its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction . `` If ever there was a regime which exposes the West 's hypocrisy , Gaddafi 's is it , '' McCrum said . `` The West has fallen over itself to rehabilitate Gaddafi so they can get at his oil and now it will pay the price in political capital -- if it has any left . In terms of investment risk , it 's obviously very serious , '' said Julien Barnes-Dace , Middle East analyst at Control Risks . `` People are just pulling out . Even if Gaddafi survives , there will be huge worries and reputational issues about doing business in Libya . Libya would be much more isolated after this . '' Analyst Geoff Porter said Gaddafi had `` nowhere to go , '' unlike ousted Arab leaders such as Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , who found refuge in Saudi Arabia , or Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak , in internal exile in Sharm el-Sheikh . `` Possibly the only place he can go is Zimbabwe , '' he said . `` So there is no alternative . -LRB- If he is toppled -RRB- , he will be like Saddam Hussein and end up hiding in a hole .

Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Who in the West has the troops , the money and the will to take over nation-building in Libya once Muammar Cadaver falls ? No matter , because the Libyan people wo n't permit such foreign interference anyway . Libya is rushing headlong down a path similar to another failed state -- Afghanistan . Libya is demonstrating the awful truth that , as horrendously bad and evil as autocratic rulers like Muammar Cadaver are , it can get a hell of a lot worse . The huge wave sweeping the Middle East is going to wash over and obliterate Western strategic interests in the entire region , and beyond . The West has been caught massively on its heels , and can not hope to ride the crest of this wave . Instead , it 's being left to flounder in its wake . Nuker -- I am curious what you think SS `` caught massively on its heels '' should have done\\/be doing differently ? Tough question to answer AFTER you 've fallen in a 20ft hole . But the U.S. should have seen this coming when the Soviet Union fell in 1989-1991 . That demonstrated the fact that peoples will allow oppression only for just so long . So the West should have begun back then to privately put increasing pressure on the oil-rich autocratic regimes to democratize . If no progress was evident after several years of effort , then it should have quietly but steadily positioned itself to be able to ride the crest of this wave whenever it inevitably would occur , and thus be looked to by the region 's peoples as the true champion of their freedoms and rights , rather than an interfering power that propped up autocrats perpetually . But , having utterly failed to look ahead and plan for this , the U.S. is really without options at present . All it can do is play a limited role in trying to limit the bloodshed and hope that the region 's peoples wo n't completely cast it and its strategic interests aside . Both Republican and Democratic administrations utterly failed us here -- none looked ahead and planned ahead sufficiently . This is scandalous considering the fact that the West is still utterly dependent upon oil , and will be for at least two more decades . This is what happens in the medium-to-long term when your words and your actions do n't even come close to matching up . The U.S. has proclaimed `` Democracy ! '' and `` Freedom ! '' and `` Human Rights ! '' while at the same time perpetually propping up insane , bloodthirsty dictators . The chickens have come home to roost . This discussion is now closed .

The opinions expressed are her own . LONDON -- Chaos in Libya could pose a threat to Mediterranean economies . The unrest in the oil-rich North African country , and the subsequent bloody reaction of its authoritarian regime , could soon present a serious strategic challenge for Western governments and corporate titans that recently embraced the long-pariah state . But it is Italy , the country 's former colonial ruler , which looks set to bear the brunt of the fallout if the situation descends into uncontrolled turmoil . Four decades of rule under unpredictable Muammar Gaddafi quite expectedly failed to deliver the Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution 's vision of a `` state of the masses '' or `` people 's capitalism '' . In one of the most corrupt countries in the world , wealth from the economy , which accounts for 2 percent of global oil production , is hardly visible among the population of 6 million . Despite its massive failings , Libya , as other similar countries , has won praise from the International Monetary Fund . The country 's relationship with Western powers deepened after U.N. sanctions against were lifted in 2003 . The United States has increased its oil imports from the country , and unsavoury government dealings have helped the likes of British oil giant BP push on with a $ 900 million exploration contract in Libya . The country 's strongest external ties , however , remain with Italy . Libya is a prominent feature on the Italian corporate landscape , with stakes in carmaker Fiat , banking group UniCredit and even the Juventus football team . Italian oil giant Eni has a 14 billion euro investment program in the country , as well as supply contracts stretching to 2047 . Overall Libyan oil accounts for around 27 percent of Italy 's consumption . Threats from Gaddafi 's son that the country 's oil `` will be burned '' can not be taken lightly . Even if Libya does n't descend into all-out civil war , it can afford a prolonged period of disruption despite its economy 's absolute dependence on oil production . The country 's net foreign assets are estimated to total $ 150 billion -- or enough to cover 37 months of imports . Italy 's politicians are reluctant to condemn Tripoli , but after the country 's decision to open fire on anti-government protestors , companies will have to weigh the dubious attraction of counting Libya amongst their shareholders . Energy investments could also now be threatened if sanctions are re-imposed . Meanwhile the near 2 percent jump in oil prices seems to suggest markets are n't overly optimistic . Greedy oil cartel members will quickly capitalize on high prices to capture a windfall . Thus , I do n't think that oil supplies anywhere will be threatened . And as a bonus , those producers will be applauded for `` stepping up to the plate '' and being a stabilizing force on the world economy , in a time of need . It 's a perfect play . Oil supplies on the planet are not unlimited -- the reason oilman George Bush used his presidency to invade a big oil producer unrelated to 911 -- US Companies ran out of accessible supplies and needed a new source . Tensions in the Middle East between the poor and the autocratic elite and their well-paid supporters have been building for decades -- the results now painfully apparent . And there is the Inconvenient Truth of global warmin -- caused by carbon-based fuels . So now we have the Perfect Storm unfolding before our very eyes . Do n't count on oil supplies or prices ever stabilizing again . Instead you will be forced to transition -- evolve -- to energy sources and production with a Green Footprint . Despite its massive failings , Libya , as other similar countries , has won praise from the International Monetary Fund . It 's too bad that Ms Galani did n't flesh this one out a little more . I suspect that the IMF 's focus is mainly on debt levels for any given nation , and obviously one that lives within its means , as most oil nations will , gets a thumbs up from them . So people reading that statement will gain a prejudiced view of the IMF as if it is complicit in supporting corruption in Libya , while that could hardly be the case . The IMF is merely a banker of last resort , as far as I can see , unless the institution is more politicized than I have been led to believe . This seems a very fair and even analysis and I doubt if the IMF comment will change any opinions about the debt merchants the IMF protects as last resort . The article and comments seem to ignore the fact that six million residents of Libya must do something , besides pounding sand , to improve their lives and add assets to Libya or to Qdufus and sons . This article has some nice tid bits of economic info that the general public should be aware of ; especially those who do n't know that Tripoli has been a pirate haven for generations .

Colonel Muammar Gaddafi has long relied on his immediate -- but small -- Qathathfa tribe to staff elite military units and guarantee his personal security and that of his government , experts say . But that is seen unlikely to be enough to secure the country . More important are the larger tribes long co-opted into his rule such as the Wafalla , who make up an estimated 1 million of Libyan 's more than 6 million population . Some rumors suggest the ferocity of Gaddafi 's crackdown on his own people may already be prompting tribal leaders to switch allegiance . `` In Libya , it will be the tribal system that will hold the balance of power rather than the military , '' said Alia Brahimi , head of the North Africa program at the London School of Economics . `` I think you will see defections of some of the main tribes if that is not happening already . It looks like he has already lost control of the east of the country where he was never popular and never fully managed to consolidate his power . '' Eastern Libya is the site of much of its oil reserves . On Tuesday , a Reuters correspondent reported that Gaddafi 's forces appeared to have abandoned their positions on the border with Egypt which were now in the hands of men armed with clubs and Kalashnikovs who said they were opposed to his rule . Who , if anyone , those men were answering to was not immediately clear . While herder and tribal lifestyles have declined in Libya in the face of rising oil-fueled urbanization , traditional power structures are said to remain strong beneath the surface . In Egypt and Tunisia , the armies proved to be the supreme political force , easing unpopular leaders Hosni Mubarak and Ben Ali from office in part due to their reluctance to fire on protesters . Libya is very different , however . Long largely closed to outsiders , details of its complex mix of alliances and loyalties are scarce . Experts generally agree part of Gaddafi 's strategy for retaining power has been to keep his own tribe in important positions . Key members of his family are said to command their own military formations , again usually members of their own Qathathfa tribe . Once largely nomadic herders , the Qathathfa were sidelined by Libya 's former monarchy but allowed to join the armed forces and police , then considered secondary organizations . Having risen through the military structure himself , Gaddafi is seen to have tried to emasculate it to prevent rival commanders from threatening him . Memorably , he abolished all ranks above his own position of colonel . Gaddafi 's unique `` Green Book , '' containing his political philosophy and system of government , vows to put an end to tribalism but in reality experts say it entrenched it . `` Gaddafi has largely dismissed the older tribal military structures but they will probably not have huge problems finding weapons , '' said the LSE 's Brahimi . `` Defections from the military will be key to this . '' Parts of the military had long appeared reluctant to use excessive force against their own people , she said . Popular rumor held that Gaddafi was forced to rely on Serbian mercenary pilots to bomb civilian areas during offensives against Islamist militancy in the 1990s . Some say Gaddafi 's tribal strategy has effectively amounted to a system of divide and rule , buying off particularly established tribal leaders from key groups . In recent years , they say , control has been faltering and recent events may accelerate this . `` Gaddafi made sure to keep the people aware of their tribal divisions , winning the alliance of larger ones and hence keeping the population under control , '' wrote Jerusalem-based journalist Lisa Goldman after a Skype conversation with a Libyan contact she said was well placed to talk on some military matters . `` Although the larger ones like the Werfalees and the Megrahees were privileged with power and money , his recent actions angered these tribes and for the first time in decades tribal barriers have withered away . People are uniting with other formerly rival tribes or even different ethnicities like the Amazeegh or Berbers . '' If Gaddafi can persuade other tribes to stay loyal to him , most experts believe he will probably try to arm them directly , raising the risks of ethnic conflict that could tear the country apart , send refugees pouring into its neighbors and jeopardize oil supplies . Gaddafi 's opponents accuse him of bringing in mercenaries from elsewhere in Africa , perhaps veterans of civil wars in the Sahel and West Africa . `` There 's a lot of weapons in the country and Gaddafi has armed tribes before that have supported him , '' said Geoff Porter , North Africa analyst and contributor to political risk consultancy Wikistrat . `` We could see something more along the lines of Lebanon 's civil war -- a prolonged period of violence and bloodshed .

Lying between Egypt and Tunisia , where a wave of Arab unrest has unseated two veteran presidents , the desert nation of six million which Gaddafi has ruled for 41 years seemed split in two , trapping thousands of foreign workers , jeopardizing oil exports and raising fears of tribal conflict and civil war . The United States , which once branded Gaddafi a `` mad dog '' but had joined European powers ' reconciliation to exploit Libya 's oil wealth , said it might impose sanctions to help end violence which one European minister said may have cost 1,000 people . President Barack Obama , who lacks the influence in Libya that U.S. aid gives him over some other Arab states , called for international unity to end the violence . He did not say Gaddafi should go , but said he would be held accountable for any abuses . `` It is imperative that the nations and peoples of the world speak with one voice , '' Obama told reporters at the White House in his first public comments on the revolt . `` The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous . '' Other foreign leaders , who also embraced Gaddafi , and his oil , after decades of isolating a leader who aided militants around the world , also voiced concern at the level of violence , which has included aerial bombing in parts of some cities . Differences over how to proceed , some driven by concern not to jeopardize the safety of foreigners caught up in the trouble , appear to limit prospects for immediate , concerted international action , although some analysts have suggested that even military force might be applied to protect the rebel east from Gaddafi . France called outright for sanctions . Obama said he would look at a `` full range of options . '' U.S. officials said sanctions were among those being considered . In the eastern city of Benghazi , cradle of the uprising and home to tribes long hostile to the 68-year-old leader , thousands filled the streets , lighting fireworks and waving the red , black and green flag of the king Colonel Gaddafi overthrew in 1969 . `` We have been suffering for 41 years , '' said 45-year-old Hamida Muftah . `` Gaddafi has killed people ... We are a very rich country , but most of the people are poorer than poor . '' A medical official said about 320 had been killed in Benghazi since protests against oppression and poverty began last week . Libya 's Quryna newspaper quoted a military source as saying a bomber crew bailed out and left their aircraft to crash rather than bomb Benghazi . Earlier in the week , two pilots flew their planes to Malta to avoid , they said , attacking their own people . In Tripoli , which remained largely closed to foreign media , local journalists said streets were calm after sporadic violence in recent days . Gaddafi 's state television channel showed dozens of loyalists waving his portrait and chanting his praises . `` Lots of people are afraid to leave their homes in Tripoli and pro-Gaddafi gunmen are roaming around threatening any people who gather in groups , '' said Tunisian Marwan Mohammed , who was crossing the border home after leaving the Libyan capital . Gaddafi 's children spoke up in defense of the man who went on television on Tuesday to fulminate against `` terrorists '' and promise to `` cleanse Libya house by house . '' They also sought to tell viewers foreign media were misreporting the week 's events . `` Libyans are the victims of the biggest joke , '' his son Saif al-Islam , once seen as a reformer , told state television . `` So wake up . The truths start today . You will see it with your own eyes , tomorrow and after tomorrow . '' Another son , former professional footballer Saadi , told the Financial Times that Saif al-Islam was drafting a constitution to `` bring in new blood to govern our country , '' adding : `` My father would stay as the big father who advises . '' He acknowledged aircraft bombed areas around Benghazi but said they hit only bases to prevent Islamist radicals seizing arms . He said his father would regain control of the east : `` When the people see the army , they will be afraid . '' Gaddafi 's daughter Aisha also appeared on state television , denying a report she tried to flee to Malta . `` I am steadfastly here , '' she said . She added she was unaware of a report she had been dropped by the United Nations as a goodwill ambassador . Others have deserted Gaddafi 's side , however . Interior Minister Abdel Fattah Younes al Abidi and a senior aide to Saif al-Islam joined them : `` I resigned from the Gaddafi Foundation on Sunday to express dismay against violence , '' Youssef Sawani , executive director of the foundation , told Reuters by SMS . Gaddafi has deployed troops to the west of the capital to try to stop the revolt that started in the east from spreading . In the east , many soldiers have withdrawn from active service . General Soliman Mahmoud al-Obeidy told Reuters in Tobruk in the east that the Libyan leader was no longer trustworthy . `` I am sure he will fall in the coming days , '' he said . Oil prices climbed above $ 111 a barrel at their highest since mid-2008 amid fears chaos could spread to other oil-producing countries and choke supplies , which could dash hopes of a quick global economic recovery . Trade sources said at least three oil cargoes did make it out of Libyan ports over the 24 hours to mid-Wednesday , however . Up to a quarter of Libya 's oil production has been closed down , based on calculations from firms in the country , which stretches from the Mediterranean into the Sahara and supplies nearly 2 percent of world oil output . Countries with strong business ties to Africa 's third largest oil producer scrambled to evacuate thousands of citizens and a Turkish worker was shot dead at a building site near the capital , Turkish officials said . A British oil worker said 300 people were stranded at a camp in the east of Libya , where he said local people had looted oil installations . `` We are living every day in fear of our lives as the local people are armed , '' James Coyle told the BBC . An estimated 1.5 million foreign nationals are working or traveling in Libya and a third of the population of 7 million are immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa . Witnesses described scenes of chaos as people tried to leave . `` It 's a biblical exodus , '' said Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , predicting several hundred thousand would seek refuge in Italy . The U.N. Security Council condemned the use of violence and called for those responsible for attacks on civilians to be held to account . British Prime Minister David Cameron called for a formal resolution . `` The Libyan regime is using appalling levels of force and violence against its own people including using airplanes that are shooting at people , '' he said . But in the latest sign of international division over how to deal with Gaddafi , the prime minister of Qatar said he did not want to isolate Libya , where several senior officials have declared their backing for protests that began about a week ago . -LRB- Reporting by Tarek Amara , Christian Lowe , Marie-Louise Gumuchian , Souhail Karam , Firouz Sedarat , Tom Pfeiffer ; Brian Love , Daren Butler ; Dina Zayed , Sarah Mikhail and Tom Perry ; Janet Lawrence and Philippa Fletcher ; writing by Alastair Macdonald ; editing by Andrew Dobbie -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Much of the oil-rich east around Benghazi appears lost . Troops melted away in the face of popular protests inspired by the overthrow of rulers in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia , leaving it in the hands of people 's militias and tribal groups . But so far Gaddafi 's opponents appear disparate and disorganized , with no centralized command and little prospect of mounting their own offensives . That could leave the initiative in Gaddafi 's hands . Analysts say he has always kept the wider military weak and disorganized , leaving real power in the hands of ultra-dedicated units often linked to his own tribal group . `` It 's always been kept deliberately nebulous , '' said Alia Brahimi , head of the North Africa program at the London School of Economics . `` But I think it 's clear there are at least several thousand troops -- perhaps more -- who will remain loyal to Gaddafi and it 's reasonable to assume that any serious military equipment is likely to be in their hands . '' Gaddafi has fomented confusion and rifts in any structure capable of posing a threat , said Jon Marks , a Libya expert and director of the Cross Border Information consultancy . `` It 's been divide and rule with the tribes , with political groups , with the regions , and above all with security , '' he said . Gaddafi may also be relying on foreign fighters brought in from elsewhere in Africa . In Benghazi , local people told Reuters they had captured several and were holding them in prison . The Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights , citing reports from Libya exile groups , estimated there were up to 6,000 mercenaries , 3,000 in Tripoli and the rest across the country . Others suggest those numbers may be vastly exaggerated . There is little solid information on Gaddafi 's weaponry and equipment , dented by years of sanctions . `` It is mainly vintage 1950s , 60s and 70s kit , '' IHS Jane 's Middle East analyst David Hartwell said . `` Some tanks and armored personnel carriers and artillery . Basic stuff , but certainly lethal . '' The opposition may also have some tanks and heavy weapons from units that defected , he said , but less in the way of spares and ammunition , less idea how to use it and currently no command and control structure . That may change if defecting military commanders and tribal chiefs form new alliances . Some experts say army chief General Abu Bakr Younus Jaber , a comrade of Gaddafi in the 1969 coup that brought him to power , is believed to have sided with the rebels . Mansour El-Kikhia , an expert on Libyan politics , estimated Gaddafi can call on 10,000-12 ,000 Libyan troops , split broadly between a 32nd Brigade led by his son Khamees , and a presidential guard that has been led by another son , Muatassim . There are also armed members of his revolutionary committees , hardline political structures that enforce internal security and which are likely to stay loyal , if only from a sense of self-preservation . `` Since the 1970s he has drummed into them that their fate is tied to his , '' Kikhia said . `` For the past 40 years he has delegated the carrying out of many of the atrocities of the regime to these forces , deliberately to implicate them . He has made sure they understood that they live or die with him . '' Information from Libya remains sketchy at best , but the battle lines are slowly emerging of what increasingly looks like a Libyan civil war . Gaddafi appears largely in control of Tripoli , after crushing protests there , while his opponents , though disorganised , have ousted him from the second city of Benghazi . The situation along the coastal strip between the two cities is more confused . Gaddafi 's home town Sirte lies in the middle , apparently under government control . Fighting was reported in the port city of Misrata , 200 km east of Tripoli . In other coastal towns , military forces have apparently been deployed to quell protesters . Gaddafi seems to be trying to cement his control of western Libya , but analysts warned he was still far from safe in Tripoli where popular protests remain a potential threat . Analysts said the air force is the only way he can hit back at opposition targets around Benghazi -- potentially including valuable oil installations . That could be complicated by the arrival of a British frigate to evacuate foreign nationals . On paper , his air force includes dozens of aircraft , mainly Russian-built jets with some 25 French-made Mirages at the start of the week . But many are believed to be out of service and Libyan pilots have proved reluctant to strike opposition areas . Two Mirage pilots defected to Malta earlier in the week and a Libyan newspaper said the crew of a third aircraft bailed out rather than bomb Benghazi . Gaddafi is said to have hired foreign mercenary pilots in the past , but finding new crews may be hard . Any war will likely be low-tech and bloody , analysts say . The good news is that Libya is believed to have given up and destroyed all stockpiles of chemical weapons as part of its rapprochement with the West . Gaddafi must know that if he did use any such weapons against civilian targets , he would invite an overwhelming response from abroad . Unlike the World War Two tank battles in the north African desert , fighting in the current conflict is expected to take place in the towns . `` This will be urban , '' said one ex-military security expert now advising the oil sector . `` Just like Iraq . '' A lengthy Iraq-style conflict or descent into Somalia-style anarchy could provide fertile ground for Islamist radicals at a time of great change in Libya 's coastal neighbors . `` The consequences could be very bleak , '' said LSE 's Brahimi . `` But right now there does n't seem to be any appetite in the outside world to do anything to stop it .

However , when all is said and done at the end of the day he is no different from hitler , stalen or any other manipulative , self-serving , megalomaniac imps serving satan 's purpose here on earth .

None of several potential outcomes is benign for Libya 's oil industry -- the lifeblood of its economy -- or for oil prices . The scenarios run the gamut from all-out civil war and attacks on energy infrastructure to low-level neglect and reservoir damage , as foreign expertise flees the country . Over decades , from Iran , to Iraq and Venezuela , periods of political chaos in OPEC countries have usually carved lasting scars on the oil sector , and few expect Libya to be any different . `` A period of chaos will probably interrupt Libya 's refining and oil operations , '' said Amy Jaffe , an energy studies fellow and Middle East expert at Rice University in Houston . `` The military is abandoning Gaddafi , so it 's unclear who is left to protect oil installations . Lots of foreigners are being evacuated , so who will remain in place capable of operating Libya 's oil industry ? Will workers even show up ? '' As Africa 's No. 3 producer and the site of the continent 's largest proved reserves , estimated at 44 billion barrels , Libyan oil usually accounts for 2 percent of world output . The country , whose oil accounts for a fourth of Italy 's demand , is the first major oil exporter to be thrust into acute turmoil since protests began sweeping through the Middle East in January , unseating presidents in Tunisia and Egypt so far . An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd of production has been halted , as companies evacuate staff and suspend operations , according to the latest Reuters calculations . Much of the country 's oil industry is run by foreign firms including Eni and Repsol , while Libya 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- has traditionally been tightly controlled by Gaddafi . Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi defiantly pledged on Tuesday to stay in power at any cost , threatening to have protesters hunted down and killed `` house by house . '' With rival factions already laying claim to an oil-rich swath of eastern Libya , separated by hundreds of miles of desert from capital Tripoli in the west , the country could even face civil war , analysts warned . In OPEC countries where oil infrastructure is the ultimate key to power and purse strings , war and other major political crises have typically resulted in supply disruptions that take years or decades to bounce back from . Iran 's 1979 revolution cut the country 's output by more than half , and production never recovered fully . Iraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait ultimately slashed output in both countries for years , and ravaged Kuwaiti oil wells . Venezuela 's massive oil industry strike of 2002 crippled production , which has never returned to pre-strike levels . To be sure , OPEC 's top producer Saudi Arabia has stepped in to boost production in previous disruptions in other member producers , and the Saudi oil minister said on Tuesday the cartel , led by the kingdom , stands ready to pump more oil , but only when needed . U.S. officials say Saudi Arabia could replace Libyan supplies within a month , although it would leave less available spare capacity . Libya 's unrest has helped push Brent crude oil prices up nearly 6 percent since Friday , touching a 2-1\\/2 - year high of nearly $ 109 a barrel , although the surge also reflects the chance that chaos will affect other oil-exporting countries . Brent rose $ 2.64 to $ 108.42 a barrel on Wednesday . `` The output of -LRB- Libya 's -RRB- oil will probably not be completely halted , but it is difficult to see this level of chaos failing to result in significant operational disruptions , '' Eurasia Group analysts said in a note on Tuesday . `` It is likely that the country will experience a prolonged period of violent instability , with a potential for full blown civil war . '' As the revolt aimed at ending Gaddafi 's 41-year rule intensifies , oil infrastructure could enter the power play . Unlike in major African exporters Nigeria and Angola where oil is mostly offshore , installations are mostly on land in Libya , making them potentially more vulnerable . `` This effectively gives the country two political factions , two energy-producing basins , two oil output infrastructures . Economically at least , the seeds of protracted conflict -- regardless of what happens with Gaddafi or any political changes after he departs - have already been sown , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor . With oil companies scrambling to pull personnel from the country , Libya 's oil industry `` will have to operate under difficult circumstances . A sustained lack of security will keep foreign oil companies at bay for a while , '' said energy consultancy PFC in a note . As yet , there are no reports of attacks on energy infrastructure , but eastern tribal leaders have threatened to shut off exports , revenue from which usually flows to capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's increasingly tenuous stronghold in the west . Nearby , an underwater gas line to Italy has already been interrupted . The fact that Libya is cutting exports of refined products may indicate workers are already abandoning the country 's refineries and their highly explosive plants out of fear . A Time Magazine intelligence columnist wrote on Tuesday that Gaddafi himself may be ordering sabotage attacks on oil pipelines leading to the Mediterranean Sea , citing a source in the region . At Libyan oil wells , which are mostly in remote desert areas , any abrupt halt could permanently damage infrastructure and compromise it for years . `` Anybody who feels they could still control the infrastructure in the future will probably not try to blow it up , '' said Jaffe . `` But companies , including the Libyan national oil company , may face a tough decision . Will they try for orderly shutdowns that ensure production can resume easily later , or keep fields going but risk events that could damage them ?

After a surge in Brent oil prices to 2 - year highs near $ 120 a barrel , South Korea , the world 's fifth-biggest crude importer , warned that its inflation situation was getting tougher . Business executives fretted about rising prices and investment banks said oil was reaching an inflection point that could endanger the world 's recovery from the global financial crisis . `` We actually think that we 'll be able to ride out the Libya situation and it will stabilize , '' Obama , referring to fuel prices , told a group of corporate chief executives . His Treasury Secretary said the world had plenty of oil reserves . `` We have substantial capacity across the major economies in the strategic reserves , '' Timothy Geithner said . `` Hopefully , by reminding people of that and calling attention to the fact that there 's a fair amount of excess capacity in parts of OPEC ... hopefully that will make it less likely the market ... starts to build in higher prices over time . '' The key risk for the world economy is a sustained rise in the price of oil . But after shooting up to close to $ 120 a barrel in intraday trade on Thursday , Brent crude futures ended the day at less than $ 112 , showing just how fraught investors nerves are . The sharp fall came after market rumors that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had been shot dead and on news that top producer Saudi Arabia could cover any supply disruptions . On Friday , Brent crude was trading around $ 112 . U.S. crude futures eased to $ 97.60 from a Thursday high of $ 103.41 . In Libya , forces loyal to Gaddafi hit back in fierce gun battles with rebels holding towns near the capital but there were no signs they had broken the opposition momentum . The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -LRB- OPEC -RRB- has an estimated 4-6 million barrels per day of spare crude production capacity , more than enough on paper to cover Libya 's output of 1.6 million barrels a day . But markets are worried that the unrest might spread to bigger producers in the region that would have a much bigger impact on the world economy . After public uprisings have already toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia , governments in the region are taking notice . Saudi Arabia this week unveiled a $ 37 billion package to try to insulate the kingdom from the wave of protests across the Arab world , while Algeria lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency as it tried to appease opposition groups . `` When you start adding the potential number of barrels at stake , you can see why the market is tense and would rather be long oil than short , '' said Harry Tchilinguirian , chief commodity strategies at BNP in London . Deutsche Bank said oil above $ 120 a barrel would be an inflection point for global economic growth . At that price , oil as a share of global GDP starts to move above 5.5 percent , historically a point where global growth has come under pressure . Airlines are feeling the brunt of high oil prices as reflected in sharp falls in stock prices . Chinese flag carrier Air China Ltd has dropped 14 percent this week . `` Unfortunately , oil prices have been rising like mad recently , '' said Li Jiaxiang , head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China . Emerging Asia , which led the world 's recovery from the global financial crisis , is already trying to deal with escalating food prices . Higher oil prices will add to the dilemma for policymakers of how to contain inflation and support economic growth . Yet another complication is that while the crude price spikes this week reflect a supply-side risk , oil prices were already rising as economic activity around the world picked up pace . `` The global recovery is ongoing , it is gaining more traction but the developments in the crude-oil sector as a result of the turmoil in the Middle East is putting to question the strength of that recovery , '' said Jose Mario Cuyegkeng , economist at ING in Manila . Since most countries have little control over the world price of oil , raising interest rates would not address the issue for their economies . But higher fuel prices could feed through to other prices , such as transport , and inflation expectations . `` The environment influencing inflation is now much more difficult than what we had expected at the end of last year , '' said Yim Jong-yong , South Korea 's vice finance minister . Indonesian central bank deputy governor Hartadi A. Sarwono said he expects a recent drop in food and commodity prices to push monthly inflation down in the country , but oil was a risk . `` We have to be cautious on long-term inflation from rising oil prices , '' he told reporters . The combination of high oil prices undermining growth while fuelling inflation raises the prospect of stagflation that blighted economies in the 1970s . Westpac rates strategist Russell Jones said there was a risk of stagflation but there were economic differences now -- including less reliance on oil and better central bank credibility -- to suggest any outbreak would be mild and short lived . Still , it would still result in a pick up in the pace of monetary policy tightening , he said . `` The longer that oil prices remain elevated , the more likely that the European Central Bank and Bank of England could hike in the second quarter . Emerging market central banks are also apt to tighten more aggressively . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . `` Gouge '' or `` Kick '' ? Go gas up your Escalade .

Saudi Arabia has boosted output by more than 700,000 barrels per day , to a level exceeding 9 million bpd , a senior industry source familiar with Saudi production told Reuters . Worries about the worsening situation in Libya , where oil outages have risen to as much as three quarters of its 1.6 million bpd output , spurred short-covering before the weekend . Those moves were further stoked by news that the United States was imposing sanctions and cutting diplomatic ties with Libya as Muammar Gaddafi 's security forces cracked down against a widening revolt against his rule . `` I do n't think many traders are comfortable being short over the weekend , '' said Tom Bentz , a broker at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York . Estimates of Libya 's supply loss could not be confirmed , however , with conditions unsettled as rebels fought to wrest control of oilfields and terminals in the east of the country from Gaddafi loyalists . On Thursday , the disruptions pushed Brent to almost $ 120 and U.S. crude to more than $ 103 . Brent shot ahead as more of Libya 's oil exports go to European refiners than to those in the United States . In London , Brent futures for April closed up 78 cents at $ 112.14 a barrel , the highest weekly settlement since August 21 , 2008 . They peaked at $ 113.91 , below Thursday 's high of $ 119.79 , the loftiest intraday since August 2008 . U.S. April crude futures settled up 60 cents at $ 97.88 , the highest weekly close since September 2008 , and reached $ 99.20 earlier . That was well below Thursday 's intraday peak of $ 103.41 , also the highest since September 2008 . Brent 's premium against U.S. crude rose to $ 14.26 , from $ 14.08 at the close on Thursday , when the Brent spread against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rocketed to a record $ 16.91 . `` Fears that the unrest in Libya could turn into a civil war and wipe out its oil production have been offset by assurances from Saudi Arabia that it is raising output , '' said Gene McGillian , analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford , Connecticut . U.S. crude drew support from a rise in consumer confidence to a three-year high in February , suggesting the economy remained on a solid footing despite high gasoline prices , according to a ThomsonReuters\\/University of Michigan survey . That optimism was tempered by the latest reading of fourth-quarter 2010 economic growth , which showed the U.S. economy grew more slowly than expected .

Analysts monitoring Libya 's crisis say the most likely outcome is that rebels eventually take the capital and either kill or capture him and a hardcore group of loyalists . Many who know Gaddafi say he will fight to the finish , even though his 41-year-old rule looks increasingly uncertain after the loss of several cities and defections by soldiers , local and national officials and diplomats . In an ominous sign for Gaddafi , poor neighborhoods of Tripoli openly defied him at a funeral on Saturday , and security forces abandoned the working-class Tajoura district after five days of demonstrations , residents said . Libya 's former justice minister , Mustafa Mohamed Abud Ajleil , has led the formation of an interim government based in the eastern city of Benghazi , Libya 's Quryna newspaper reported . Defeat may not be swift , and in the short term it is not the only possibility . Here are other scenarios . GADDAFI FIGHTS BACK , A STANDOFF WITH THE REBELS ENSUES With several thousand troops backed by heavy armor deployed around the capital , and pro-Gaddafi gunmen violently suppressing dissent inside it , Gaddafi may have enough firepower for now to stop any opposition gains in the city , said Jon Marks , chairman of Britain 's Cross Border Information consultancy . Marks said dissidents in the capital were waiting `` for reinforcements . '' But help might not arrive if Gaddafi 's son Khamees , who leads the army 's reportedly powerful 32nd Brigade , crushes advances on the approach roads to the city , he said . In addition hundreds and possibly thousands of armed internal security agents in Tripoli would be on alert for any attempt by the opposition to quietly infiltrate armed men into the capital from outlying areas , security experts say . Military experts estimate Gaddafi can count on 10,000 to 12,000 troops , not counting loyalists in the security services and mercenaries . He also controls Tripoli airport and the port . A standoff might give Gaddafi time to deploy economic or paramilitary means to shore up links with any tribes that have not yet declared themselves for the rebels . GADDAFI FLEES TRIPOLI , STARTS DESERT INSURGENCY London-based Algerian lawyer Saad Djebbar , who knows a large number of Gaddafi 's top officials , says that for Gaddafi staying in power had become impossible . `` It 's about staying alive . '' `` He will create conditions for guerrilla warfare , that 's why he invited Libyans to take weapons , '' he said . Gaddafi may flee to the southern desert area of Sebha where his tribe is from and try to destabilise country from there . He might also try to flee to his hometown of Sirte , but this may be too risky -- it is near the east , which is in rebel hands . `` Someone like him must have already made some hideouts in the desert , '' said Djebbar . Geoff Porter , an independent U.S. analyst , said he could envisage the crisis ending up as a `` manhunt , '' adding : `` He could well go to ground with loyal henchmen . So he may fall from power , but his whereabouts may not be known for weeks . '' GADDAFI FLEES TRIPOLI , TRIBES AGREE TRUCE TO PREVENT CHAOS Djebbar said Gaddafi 's `` time is over . But how much damage he will cause before leaving is the question . '' He said the amount of disruption that would follow a defeat of Gaddafi depended on the loyalty of his tribesmen and relatives . At some stage , Gaddafi 's Gaddadfa tribe would decide to negotiate with other tribes and agree to cease hostilities . Libya expert Mansour El-Kikhia says rifts in the Gaddadfa had already opened up between loyalists and dissidents . The Gaddadfa want to do everything to avoid being persecuted by vengeful authorities in a future post-Gaddafi Libya . Ajleil said Libya was not in a phase of score-settling and the Gaddadfa were forgiven , Quryna said . GADDAFI FOMENTS A FULLY-FLEDGED CIVIL WAR This is seen at present as unlikely . But Marks said he could envision a standoff between `` a weird sort of city state ruled by this rump of Gaddafi forces , and the rest of the country ruled by an opposition that lacks the clout to take the capital quickly . If that endures , you may end up with a civil war . Djebbar said that the longer Gaddafi continued crushing protests , the more difficult it would be for his tribe to negotiate a peaceful settlement . GADDAFI IS TOPPLED , FLEES ABROAD Djebbar said he could envision Gaddafi 's closest relatives pushing him to negotiate with allied tribal leaders and senior officers to obtain safe passage to leave the country . `` We have noticed how many of his henchmen who have defected sought refuge with their tribes or fiefdom , which highlights the importance of tribes in determining Gaddafi 's future . `` So he , or his relatives , can tell allied tribes ` I 'll cease the hostility on condition I leave for some country without facing trial . '' Few countries are expected to be willing to take Gaddafi . And once abroad he might be vulnerable to any future attempt to extradite him for prosecution on war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague .

In the oil-rich east around the second city of Benghazi , freed a week ago by a disparate coalition of people power and defecting military units , a former minister of Gaddafi announced the formation of an `` interim government '' to reunite the country . At Tripoli in the west , the 68-year-old Brother Leader 's redoubt was shrinking . Reuters correspondents found residents in some neighborhoods of the capital barricading their streets and proclaiming open defiance after security forces melted away . Western leaders , their rhetoric emboldened by evacuations that have sharply reduced the number of their citizens stranded in the oilfields and cities of the sprawling desert state , spoke out more clearly to say Gaddafi 's 41-year rule must now end . `` When a leader 's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people , he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now , '' aides to U.S. President Barack Obama said in describing a call on Libya he had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also showed a harder tone from Washington , which had warmed to Gaddafi in recent years after decades of sanctions : '' -LRB- He -RRB- has lost the confidence of his people and he should go without further bloodshed and violence . '' A vote in the United Nations Security Council was imminent . It may impose sanctions and say Gaddafi should face war crimes charges over deaths , estimated by diplomats at some 2,000 , during his 10 days of efforts to stem the tide of revolution . Talk of possible military action by foreign governments remained vague , however . It was unclear how long Gaddafi , with some thousands of loyalists , some his tribesmen , others military units commanded by his sons , might hold out against rebel forces comprised of youthful gunmen and mutinous soldiers . Correspondents in Tripoli reported occasional gunfire after dark but could not assess the balance of forces in the city . London-based Algerian lawyer Saad Djebbar , who knows a large number of Gaddafi 's top officials , says that for Gaddafi staying in power had become impossible . `` It 's about staying alive . '' '' -LRB- Gaddafi 's -RRB- time is over , '' he added . `` But how much damage he will cause before leaving is the question . '' One key element in the opposition 's efforts to unseat him may be tribal loyalties , always a factor in the desert nation of six million and one which Gaddafi , despite official rhetoric to the contrary , tended to reinforce down the years . His former justice minister Mustafa Mohamed Abud Ajleil , now gone over to the opposition in Benghazi , was quoted by the online edition of the Quryna newspaper as saying that an interim government , whose status remained unclear , would `` forgive '' his large Gaddadfa tribe for `` crimes '' committed by the leader . Such declarations may be intended to erode Gaddafi 's efforts to rally supporters into a do-or-die defense of the old guard . One of his sons , the London-educated Saif al-Islam , again appeared on television on Saturday to deny that much of Libya was in revolt . But he also warned : `` What the Libyan nation is going through has opened the door to all options , and now the signs of civil war and foreign interference have started . '' Gaddafi , once branded a `` mad dog '' by Washington for his support of militant groups worldwide , has been embraced by the West in recent years in return for renouncing some weapons programs and , critically , for opening up Libya 's oilfields . While money has flowed into Libya , many people , especially in the long-restive and oil-rich east , have seen little benefit and , inspired by the popular overthrow of veteran strongmen in Tunisia and Egypt , on either side of their country , they rose up to demand better conditions and political freedoms last week . Particular condemnation has been reserved for aerial bombing by government forces and for reported indiscriminate attacks by Gaddafi loyalists and mercenaries on unarmed protesters . `` Gaddafi is the enemy of God ! '' a crowd chanted on Saturday in Tajoura , a poor neighborhood of Tripoli , at the funeral of a man they said was shot down by Gaddafi loyalists the day before . Now , residents said , those security forces had disappeared . Locals had erected barricades of rocks and palm trees across rubbish-strewn streets , and graffiti covered many walls . Gaddafi 's forces were nowhere to be seen but bullet holes in the walls of the tightly packed houses bore testimony to violence . The residents , still unwilling to be identified for fear of reprisals , said troops fired on demonstrators who tried to march from Tajoura to central Green Square overnight , killing at least five people . The number could not be independently confirmed . A funeral on Saturday morning for one of the victims turned into another show of defiance . `` We will demonstrate again and again , today , tomorrow , the day after tomorrow until they change , '' a man who called himself Ali , aged 25 , told Reuters . Libyan state television again showed a crowd chanting their loyalty to Gaddafi in Tripoli 's Green Square on Saturday . But journalists estimated their number at scarcely 200 . From Misrata , a major city 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , residents and exile groups said by telephone that a thrust by forces loyal to Gaddafi , operating from the local airport , had been rebuffed with bloodshed by the opposition . `` There were violent clashes last night and in the early hours of the morning near the airport , '' one resident , Mohammed , told Reuters . `` An extreme state of alert prevails in the city . '' He said several mercenaries from Chad had been detained by rebels in Misrata . The report could not be verified but was similar to accounts elsewhere of Gaddafi deploying fighters brought in from African states where has long had allies . Protesters in Zawiyah , an oil refining town on the main coastal highway 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , have fought off government forces for several nights , according to witnesses who fled across the nearby Tunisian border at Ras Jdir . At Tripoli 's international airport , thousands of desperate foreign workers besieged the main gate trying to leave the country as police used batons and whips to keep them out . Outside the main terminal was a sprawling camp of makeshift tents and people huddled together in the cold , wrapped in blankets and surrounded by heaps of clothes , food and garbage . Britain and France followed the United States in closing their embassies . Britain sent in air force troop carriers to take some 150 oil workers out of camps in the desert . Libya supplies 2 percent of the world 's oil , the bulk of it from wells and supply terminals in the east . The prospect of it being shut off -- as well as speculation that the unrest in the Arab world could spread to the major exporters of the Gulf -- has pushed oil prices up to highs not seen in over two years . In recent days , the flamboyant Gaddafi has made several appearances railing against his enemies as rats and cockroaches and blaming the unrest on a range of foes from the United States and Israel to al Qaeda militants and youths high on drugs . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It will be not long now . The only question is will he fall on his sword or be hung high by his people .

The bank said it saw substantial upside risks to Brent crude oil LCOc1 prices over the next few months and that its forecasts for oil prices were `` skewed to the upside '' . `` The combination of a substantial run-up in demand coupled with a very severe supply shock makes a spike and crash scenario increasingly likely for global oil prices and the world economy , '' it said . `` In our opinion , if Brent crude oil prices hold at around $ 110 - $ 115 per barrel in 2011 , energy as a percentage of GDP would remain close to record levels , suggesting that the point of demand destruction is in short sight .

The head of Italian oil company ENI , the biggest foreign operator in Libya , said he thought two-thirds of Libyan oil and gas output had been halted and warned oil extraction could halt if shipments did not resume . Foreign firms have been pulling staff out of Libya due to the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule . China 's three major state-owned oil and gas companies have evacuated all their Chinese employees . U.S. oil firm Marathon Oil Corp also said it had evacuated all expatriate employees and their dependents from Libya , while ConocoPhillips said it had closed its operations there and evacuated some employees due to the unrest . About half of Libya 's 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of production had been cut , IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol told Reuters Insider TV , citing industry reports . That is higher than the IEA estimated initially . Oil prices jumped toward $ 120 a barrel last week for the first time since 2008 because of the disruption in Libya , the world 's 12th largest oil exporter . Prices have since eased to $ 112 , partly because Saudi Arabia has promised to meet any shortages . `` This is not good news for suppliers in the market but at the same time it is very comforting that Saudi Arabia showed their readiness to make up , '' Birol told Reuters in the interview . All demands for extra oil have been met , the head of Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco said on Monday . The kingdom has boosted its output to around 9 million bpd , a senior Saudi source told Reuters , to meet demand . `` All incremental needs requested by our customers have been met , '' Saudi Aramco CEO Khalid al-Falih said . As well as the scale of the loss of Libya 's oil , the duration of the shutdown is also a concern to oil markets . Some analysts expect it may be out for a while . `` With Libya apparently at risk of a civil war , there are reasons to believe that oil supplies in that country could be off for months , '' Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note . Libya 's oil exports and oil tanker loadings remained at a virtual standstill . The country exports about 1.3 million bpd of high-quality crude , mostly to Europe . The size of the cut in Libya 's oil output remains unclear partly because of disrupted communications with the country . Eni 's chief executive , Paolo Scaroni , said on Monday he thought two-thirds of Libyan oil and gas output had been halted . He had put the disruption at 1.2 million bpd , or 75 percent , last week . Most of Libya 's oilfields are no longer under Gaddafi 's control , the European Union 's energy commissioner said on Monday . A unit of Libya 's state-owned National Oil Corp has decided to operate separately from its parent until Gaddafi is overthrown and Tripoli is free of his rule , an official said . -LRB- Reporting by Ludovic Vickers , Jim Bai , Selam Gebrekidan , Tom Miles , Martina Fuchs , Reem Shamseddine , Barbara Lewis and Giancarlo Navach ; editing by James Jukwey -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "378", "dct": "2011-02-28", "dates": ["2011-02-28", "2011-02-28", "2011-02-28", "2011-02-28", "2011-02-28", "2011-02-28", "2011-02-01", "2011-02-26", "2011-02-28"], "text": "TRIPOLI | Mon Feb 28 , 2011 10:35 pm GMT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States and other foreign governments discussed military options for dealing with Libya on Monday as Muammar Gaddafi scoffed at the threat to his government from a spreading popular uprising . With government forces massing to try to take back strategic coastal cities from rebels , the United States said it was moving U.S. naval and air forces closer to Libya . U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Washington was in talks with its NATO partners and other allies about military options . British Prime Minister David Cameron said his government would work to prepare for a `` no-fly '' zone in Libya to protect the people from attacks by Gaddafi 's forces . Gaddafi himself rejected calls for him to step down and dismissed the strength of the uprising against his 41-year rule that has ended his control over eastern Libya and is closing in on the capital Tripoli . `` All my people love me . They would die to protect me , '' he said in a joint interview with U.S. ABC network and the BBC on Monday . He denied using his air force to attack protesters but said planes had bombed military sites and ammunition depots . He also denied there had been demonstrations and said young people were given drugs by al Qaeda and therefore took to the streets . Libyan forces had orders not to fire back at them . Gaddafi said he felt betrayed by the United States and accused Western countries of abandoning his government in its fight against `` terrorists . '' U.S. President Barack Obama appeared to be misinformed about the situation , he added . Gaddafi , 68 , looked relaxed and laughed at times during the interview at a restaurant on Tripoli 's Mediterranean coast . Ambassador Rice called him `` delusional . '' As the uprising entered its third week , the exact situation on the ground was often hard for reporters to assess due to the difficulties of moving around some parts of the desert nation and patchy communications . But witnesses in Misrata , a city of a half a million people 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- to the east of Tripoli , and Zawiyah , a strategic refinery town 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- to the west , said government forces were mounting or preparing attacks . `` An aircraft was shot down this morning while it was firing on the local radio station . Protesters captured its crew , '' a witness in Misrata , Mohamed , told Reuters by telephone . A battle for the military air base was also under way , he said , although a Libyan government source denied the report . A resident of Zawiyah called Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone that brigades commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis were on the outskirts of the town and looked ready to attack . In Tripoli , Gaddafi 's last stronghold , several people were killed and others wounded on Monday when forces loyal to Gaddafi opened fire to disperse a protest in Tajoura neighborhood , Morocco 's Quryna newspaper reported . The protest gathered close to 10,000 protesters , the Libyan newspaper said , quoting its correspondent . `` When the protesters reached the Souk Juma -LRB- market -RRB- , they were joined by armed men from the Gaddafi battalion who were dressed as civilians and opened fire on the unarmed youths . Many among the youths were wounded and killed , '' it said . In Tripoli , queues outside bakeries and soaring rice and flour prices fuelled public anger . `` There is n't enough food , '' said Basim , 25 , a bank employee , adding that many workers in the public sector had yet to receive salaries for February . Crowds of people also massed outside state banks , which have started distributing handouts of about $ 400 per family in an effort by Gaddafi 's government to drum up support . Foreign governments increased the pressure on Gaddafi to leave in the hope of ending fighting that has claimed at least 1,000 lives and restoring order to a country that accounts for 2 percent of the world 's oil production . The U.N. Security Council on Saturday slapped sanctions on Gaddafi and other Libyan officials , imposed an arms embargo and froze Libyan assets . European Union governments approved their sanctions against Gaddafi in Brussels on Monday . The United States , whose Sixth Fleet operates out of Italy , said it was moving U.S. naval and air forces closer to Libya and working on various contingency plans . `` We 're still in that planning and preparing mode should we be called upon to do any of those types of missions , whether humanitarian and otherwise , '' Pentagon spokesman Colonel David Lapan said in Washington . Prime Minister Cameron , speaking in parliament , urged Gaddafi to step down and said all measures would be considered to pressure him to go . `` We do not in any way rule out the use of military assets , '' Cameron said . `` I have asked the Ministry of Defense and the Chief of the Defense Staff to work with our allies on plans for a military no-fly zone . '' Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said his government would ask the United Nations to approve a no-fly zone . Foreign Minister Franco Frattini of Italy -- formerly Libya 's closest ally in Europe -- told Reuters a no-fly zone was a useful measure . Italy would consider allowing allies to use its bases but the Security Council must first approve the measure , he said . NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen distanced himself from talk of an imminent implementation , saying the Security Council resolution excluded the use of armed forces and did not mention a no-fly zone . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that Gaddafi was using `` mercenaries and thugs '' to repress his people and that he must step down immediately . Revolutions in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt have helped to ignite resentment of four decades of often bloody political repression under Gaddafi as well as his failure to use Libya 's oil wealth to tackle widespread poverty and lack of opportunity . Regional experts expect rebels eventually to take the capital and kill or capture Gaddafi but say he has the firepower to foment chaos or civil war . Opposition forces are largely in control of Libya 's oil facilities , which are mostly located in the east . Industry reports suggested Libya 's oil output had been halved as expatriate workers pulled out , Fatih Birol , chief economist of the International Energy Agency , said . Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated in a note to clients that Libya was losing about 1.2 million barrels per day , or 75 percent of its pre-revolt output , and said the unrest could mean Libyan supplies were unavailable for months . Industry sources said actual shipments were at a standstill . Brent crude was around $ 112 a barrel in choppy trading . Wealthy states have sent planes and ships to bring home expatriate workers but many more , from poorer countries , are stranded . The United Nations refugee agency said nearly 100,000 people have fled the violence in a growing humanitarian crisis . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

Full Article SCENARIOS - Ivory Coast heading back towards civil war ? ABIDJAN\\/DAKAR | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 5:29 pm IST ABIDJAN\\/DAKAR -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Ivory Coast 's post-poll crisis is degenerating into armed conflict , with gun battles between forces loyal to presidential rivals erupting in the commercial capital Abidjan and the volatile west of the country . Incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo has defied international pressure to step down after U.N. certified poll results showed he lost an election that was meant to end years of stalemate following a 2002-3 civil war . His rival Alassane Ouattara is internationally recognized as president-elect of Ivory Coast but remains trapped in a lagoon-side hotel under siege by the pro-Gbagbo military , but forces siding with him have succeeded in seizing a town in the west and large swathes of an Abidjan neighborhood . Here are some possible scenarios in the weeks ahead : THE RETURN TO ALL-OUT WAR With daily AK-47 assault rifles and heavy weapons fire booming through Abidjan , and clashes erupting in various places across the country this week , a return to all out civil war is looking increasingly likely . Gbagbo still retains the public loyalty of the armed forces but , fearing a coup , is believed to have ensured that only his core elite forces have adequate access to the army 's weapons . U.N. accusations that Gbagbo has been seeking attack helicopters from Belarus further support fears of war . Both Belarus and Gbagbo 's government have denied the accusations . It is not clear whether Ouattara is ready to sanction a full-blown rebel advance , as it would taint his credibility if he came to power . Nor is it clear the rebels would succeed if they mounted any such offensive . But analysts say Gbagbo 's forces may be spread thin if clashes are opened up on enough fronts and he risks defections if losses within his ranks start building up -- as they seemed to do this week , with a number of deadly ambushes in Abidjan . A military source says increasing numbers of soldiers in the Ivorian military are deserting , by switching their phones off and going into hiding . A few are defecting to the other side . An unknown factor remains foreign mercenaries and Ivorian militia fighters that analysts say Gbagbo has on his payroll , although he needs money to pay them at a time when the financial noose is closing around him from sanctions and bank closures . A STALEMATE OF SPORADIC CLASHES Ivory Coast 's crises have a habit of fizzling into a slow burn neither war nor peace stalemate -- as has been the case since 2002-3 . In this scenario , no side makes much progress and the frontline does n't move much from the existing north-south one , with armed men on each side looting what they can from a rapidly shrinking economy . But previous such stalemates were possible because negotiations held out the hope of a resolution eventually . That now seems impossible since Gbagbo effectively tore up the peace process by refusing to accept the poll results . In this scenario , there would be a high likelihood of civilian unrest . This week saw pro-Gbagbo mobs attack Ouattara supporters and U.N. peacekeepers , after a call by Gbagbo 's youth leader to set up roadblocks and block their movements . AU PROPOSES A WAY OUT African presidents tasked with resolving the Ivorian crisis by proposing a `` binding solution '' have been given another month to complete what appears to be a Herculean task . Divisions emerged within the panel during their working visit to Abidjan , with Burkina Faso 's president and the head of ECOWAS objecting to the AU continuing with its trip despite threats against them by pro-Gbagbo supporters . Both sides have dug in so deep it is unclear what the AU might propose that would be palatable to both . An outside chance is talk that the AU could propose scrapping the Nov. 28 poll and holding a new one , potentially even with both Gbagbo and Ouattara ruled out and an outside force like Nigeria filling the security vacuum . This is unlikely to be popular in either camp but could be seen as the only way to break the deadlock . GBAGBO BOWS TO DEMANDS AND LEAVES Analysts see this as extremely unlikely unless his own life is in danger . Gbagbo has shown that he is more than willing to watch his country implode economically and head back to all out civil war if it will keep him in power . He has brushed off Western economic sanctions , bank closures and threats of force by West African regional bloc ECOWAS . He has also snubbed offers of a potentially lucrative soft landing in exile in the United States or South Africa . The killings of dozens of Ouattara supporters by pro-Gbagbo forces or allied militias in past weeks also create a strong disincentive for him to leave voluntarily , fearing reprisals or being tried for war crimes in the International Criminal Court . However , if the insurgency that is raging in Abidjan could attract enough army defectors to reach the gates of Gbagbo 's house , that might be more persuasive .

Gonzi told reporters late on Monday that Libya 's prime minister had personally requested the return of the two Mirage jet fighters . Malta rejected the request and the fighters are still under armed guard at the airport . Their pilots have sought political asylum . Gonzi said a Libyan Arab Airlines flight which was denied landing permission at Malta on Tuesday last week had been carrying pilots sent to take the Mirages back . The prime minister told a news conference he had approved humanitarian missions to Libya from the island , which according to its constitution is neutral and non-aligned . Some 12,000 oil workers have been evacuated in a week by air and ferries to Malta , which has a population of just 410,000 . A rapid succession of flights is taking them on to their home countries . More evacuated workers arrived from Libya on Tuesday with a German-chartered ship bringing some 500 workers of many nationalities . The island had also been the departure point for rescue flights by the British Royal Air Force to pick up workers from the desert . The flights have been carried out without Libyan authorization . Gonzi said Malta was offering its service as a coordinating center for international humanitarian aid to Libya . A number of Maltese NGOs have already started public collections of food and medicines . Anti-Gaddafi protesters scrambled up the facade of the two-storey Libyan embassy in Valletta on Tuesday and raised the pre-Gaddafi Libyan flag . Libyan Ambassador Saadun Suayeh , who had earlier met the protesters , said he would accept any flag which represented the Libyan people . He said he intended to stay in his post but would meet Foreign Minister Tonio Borg . In media comments over the past two days , the ambassador has made a distinction between the Libyan people and the Libyan government and said the embassy represented all of Libya .

WASHINGTON | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 12:46 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya may become a peaceful democracy or face a drawn-out civil war , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday as she urged Congress not to cut funds she said were vital to deal with crises abroad . U.S. global leadership needs resolve and resources , Clinton told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in the first of four congressional hearings this week where she will defend her budget against proposed Republican reductions . `` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos . The stakes are high , '' she said . `` The entire -LRB- Middle East -RRB- region is changing , and a strong and strategic American response will be essential . '' Libya , where Muammar Gaddafi is trying to crush a revolt , was an example of how Washington must use its resources to `` protect our interests and advance our values , '' she told the lawmakers , some of whom want to cut overseas spending . Clinton spoke a day after the United States began moving warships and aircraft closer to Libya , and froze $ 30 billion in assets , stepping up pressure on Gaddafi to give up power . `` We are taking no options off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to turn its guns on its own people , '' she said . Clinton has just returned from Geneva , where she discussed Libya with other governments outraged over Gaddafi 's violent attempt to put down the rebellion against his 41-year rule . No one expects any direct foreign military intervention in Libya for now , although there has been talk of a no-fly zone to prevent Libya 's air force from attacking protesters . U.S. officials say privately that there is little appetite for a no-fly zone . Separately , Clinton played down the idea of foreign forces helping opposition fighters to topple Gaddafi , saying `` they want this to have been their accomplishment . We respect that . '' Clinton testified to defend U.S. President Barack Obama 's $ 47 billion budget request -- up 1 percent from 2010 levels -- for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development , calling it a `` lean budget for lean times . '' Republicans , who took control of the House in November elections , have called for a tough new look at non-military overseas spending amid widespread calls to control the ballooning U.S. federal deficit . Clinton said Americans were justifiably concerned about the national debt but insisted they also wanted investments in the future , including diplomacy and aid to other countries . Retreating from international responsibilities often imposed long-term costs , she said , as happened in Afghanistan when the United States `` walked away '' after the Cold War ended and Soviet troops had gone home . `` We saved money in the short term . But those savings came at an unspeakable cost -- one we are still paying , 10 years later , in money and lives , '' she said , alluding to the rise of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . Representative Howard Berman , the committee 's top Democrat , called the Republican approach to cutting spending on diplomacy and development aid a `` slash and burn process . '' Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , the Florida Republican who chairs the committee , largely rejected that argument . `` Those who complain about diminished levels of international affairs funding need to ask themselves : How much less would an insolvent United States of America be able to do ?

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States and its NATO allies were still considering a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya , although military commanders warned of the peril to allied aircraft of enforcing it . The United States has also frozen $ 30 billion in Libyan assets . `` We are going to keep the pressure on Gaddafi until he steps down and allows the people of Libya to express themselves freely and determine their own future , '' Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' program . Two amphibious assault ships -- the USS Kearsarge , which can carry 2,000 Marines , and the USS Ponce -- were due to sail through the Suez Canal and enter the Mediterranean Sea early on Wednesday morning , an Egyptian official said . The repositioning of U.S. ships and aircraft closer to Libya is widely seen as a symbolic show of force since neither the United States nor its NATO allies have shown any appetite for direct military intervention in the turmoil that has seen Gaddafi lose control of large swaths of his country . U.S. officials said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts as tens of thousands of people flee the violence . But they said military action remained an option . `` We are looking at a lot of options and contingencies . No decisions have been made on any other actions , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , noting the United Nations had not authorized the use of force in Libya . As of Tuesday , there were three U.S. ships in the Mediterranean -- two destroyers and the USS Mount Whitney , the command ship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet based in Gaeta , Italy . Gates declined to comment on reports the USS Enterprise , an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea , could be moved into the Mediterranean , a step that would significantly augment the U.S. military presence off Libya . Clinton warned of civil strife if Gaddafi , whose forces are trying to regain control of areas now in rebel hands , refused to step down . `` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos , '' she told U.S. lawmakers . Clinton also said U.S. authorities would look into claims that Gaddafi may have ordered the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie that killed 270 people . Libya accepted civil responsibility for the bombing in 2003 but Gaddafi has never been held to account . Rice said the United States would work to stabilize oil prices , which jumped to their highest in 21\\/2 years on unrest in the oil-producing North African country . `` This ... does have potential implications for oil supply , oil prices , '' she said . Some Republican lawmakers have criticized the Obama administration 's initially cautious response to the Libyan crisis and pressed it to impose a no-fly zone . That would prevent Gaddafi from using his air force against the rebels , although analysts say the Libyan leader has been relying mainly on ground forces to attack opponents . Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said a no-fly zone would be a highly complex operation . `` If we were to set it up ... we 'd have to work our way through doing it in a safe manner and not put ourselves in jeopardy , '' he said . Libya 's Air Defense Command is estimated to have at least 216 surface-to-air missiles and 144 towed and 72 self-propelled missiles . But many analysts say much of Libya 's military equipment is poorly maintained or unusable , raising questions about what threat the anti-aircraft missiles would pose .

Two amphibious assault ships , the USS Kearsarge , which can carry 2,000 Marines , and the USS Ponce , are in the Red Sea and are expected to go through the canal early on Wednesday . The White House said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts but stressed it `` was not taking any options off the table . '' `` We are looking at a lot of options and contingencies . No decisions have been made on any other actions , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sounded a note of caution , saying military intervention would not happen without a clear United Nations mandate . British Prime Minister David Cameron said it was unacceptable that `` Colonel Gaddafi can be murdering his own people using airplanes and helicopter gunships . '' General James Mattis , commander of U.S. Central Command , told a Senate hearing that imposing a no-fly zone would be a `` challenging '' operation that would mean actual attack . `` You would have to remove air defense capability in order to establish a no-fly zone , so no illusions here , '' he said . `` It would be a military operation -- it would n't be just telling people not to fly airplanes . '' Analysts said Western leaders were in no mood to rush into conflict after the troubled , drawn-out involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq . `` They will be desperate not to place themselves in that situation , unless not doing so would result in even worse massacres , '' said Shashank Joshi of London 's Royal United Services Institute . Suspicions grew that Gaddafi , a survivor of past coup attempts , did not grasp the scale of the forces against him . `` All my people love me , '' he told the ABC network and the BBC on Monday , dismissing the significance of a rebellion that has ended his control over much of oil-rich eastern Libya . Rebel fighters claimed the balance of the conflict was swinging their way . `` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a spokesman in Zawiyah , only 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . A rebel army officer in the eastern city of Ajdabiyah said rebel units were becoming more organised . `` All the military councils of Free Libya are meeting to form a unified military council to plan an attack on Gaddafi security units , militias and mercenaries , '' Captain Faris Zwei said . He said there were more than 10,000 volunteers in the city , plus defecting soldiers . Rebels guarding a munitions store said they feared a direct hit by Gaddafi 's warplanes could cause destruction for miles around . But Zwei said pilots appeared to be aiming to miss . `` We have complete confidence in the Libyan air force not to hit anything that affects their relatives in the east , '' he said . Despite the widespread collapse of Gaddafi 's writ , his forces were fighting back in some regions . A reporter on the Tunisian border saw Libyan troops reassert control at a crossing abandoned on Monday , and residents of Nalut , about 60 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- from the border , said they feared pro-Gaddafi forces were planning to recapture the town . Mohamed , a resident of rebel-held Misrata , told Reuters by phone : `` Symbols of Gaddafi 's regime have been swept away from the city . Only a -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- battalion remains at the city 's air base but they appear to be willing to negotiate safe exit out of the air base . We are not sure if this is genuine or just a trick to attack the city again . '' Across the country , tribal leaders , officials , military officers and army units have defected to the rebels . Sanctions will squeeze his access to funds . Tripoli is a clear Gaddafi stronghold , but even in the capital , loyalties are divided . Many on the streets on Tuesday expressed loyalty but a man who described himself as a military pilot said : `` One hundred percent of Libyans do n't like him . '' There were queues outside bread shops on Tuesday morning . Some residents said many shops were limiting the number of loaves customers could buy . The U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday unanimously suspended Libya 's membership of the U.N. Human Rights Council because of violence by Libyan forces against protesters . A U.N. Security Council resolution on Saturday called for a freeze on Gaddafi 's assets and a travel ban and refers his crackdown to the International Criminal Court . Libya 's National Oil Corporation said output had halved because of the departure of foreign workers . Brent crude prices surged above $ 116 a barrel as supply disruptions and the potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa kept investors on edge . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . By not demanding immediate military assistance from outside forces to combat Gadhafi s helicopter gunships , tanks and other heavy weaponry is it the will of the Islamic hardliners in the Libyan opposition to sacrifice 100,000 Libyan citizens to Gadhafi s military machine so that these Islamic hardliners can impose their diabolical Religious Democracy upon the backs of Libyan citizens and thereby crush the Libyan revolution ? Local Libyan militias had better read the text of those demanding their weapons for they will be turned on them if they choose unwisely . Run with wolves be prepared to be devoured or worse to become a wolf . We should go public with a bona fide no-fly-zone offer ! Make that , Very Public , offer directly to the Libyan opposition leaders in Benghazi and elsewhere and , in addition , make it through a formal demand for a no fly zone in the UN Security Council and General Assembly . Immediate unilateral US action may or may not be necessary at the most current moment , but if thousands of Libyans citizens are killed by Qaddhfi , let it NOT be said that it was for lack of a genuine effort by the US . A flight of F-15s coming in fast and low over his troops will put an end to this . All they want is a paycheck , and they are n't willing to fight hard to get one . This discussion is now closed .

Armed with tanks , anti-aircraft guns mounted on pick-up trucks and automatic rifles , the rebels in the strategic city of Zawiyah said they had repelled several attacks in past days by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi trying to retake the city . The road between Tripoli and Zawiyah , which is about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- long , was blocked by at least 12 checkpoints , most of them reinforced with tanks , when Reuters reporters drove through the area on Tuesday . At least eight Russian-designed truck-mounted Grad rocket launchers were deployed about 20 km east of Zawiyah . The rebels , who appear to control only the central part of the city , said their forces had started launching attacks on army checkpoints encroaching on the town . `` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a resistance spokesman . Asked if more attacks were planned , he added : `` We plan to attack checkpoints to send them away . '' In one incident late on Monday , he said three government soldiers were killed in skirmishes with rebel forces . A Libyan government spokesman said 10 soldiers were killed . The government says it is not using military force to retake rebel-held cities . However , one official did not rule out using force on Monday if all other options were exhausted . In central Zawiyah , where the red , green and black flags of the anti-Gaddafi revolt flew from government buildings , protesters said roadblocks around the city were disrupting food and medicine supplies . `` The situation is really bad . We are isolated , we can not get food supplies , '' said Ibrahim Klami , a human rights lawyer who has joined the rebellion in Zawiyah . `` We need human rights organizations to help us . There is little food and milk for babies . ... Gaddafi is trying to hide this . The city is no longer controlled by Gaddafi . '' On the outskirts of the city , life appeared to be more tranquil . Shops were open and herds of sheep were grazing in lush fields dotted with yellow daffodils . But in the central square , barricaded against the rest of the city with blocks of concrete and palm tree trunks , a tank and several operational anti-aircraft guns were a testament to the rebels ' determination to fight on . A crowd chanted `` Gaddafi you madman '' and `` Down with the dictator '' and fired shots into the air . The entire front of a building facing the square was painted in opposition colors . Some , clutching their Kalashnikovs , were reclining inside military-style tents pitched over heaps of colorful carpets . `` This is how we win . Our victory is near , '' said one young man , Haitham . `` We have weapons and people 's support .

Captain Faris Zwei , among military officers in the east who had joined the opposition to Muammar Gaddafi , told Reuters there were more than 10,000 volunteers in Ajdabiyah , about 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- from the capital which was still held by forces loyal to the Libyan leader . `` We are reorganising the army , which was almost completely destroyed by Gaddafi and his gang before they left , '' he said . `` We are reforming , as much as we can , the army from the youth that took part in the revolution . '' He added : `` We 're currently waiting for Tripoli to free itself , and we will give them time to have this honor . '' Zwei declined to give a figure for the number of troops who had defected but said all forces were under the aegis of a newly formed military council encompassing all rebel-held areas . `` In Ajdabiya , we have more than 10,000 volunteers , not including official soldiers , '' he said . Other military officials have said they needed to train volunteer recruits first before making a push west . The officers and other witnesses reported that an air force plane bombed close to a munitions store near Ajdabiyah on Monday . The aircraft returned to attack the Haniyeh base a second time , striking close to a storage bunker inside the walls , they said . `` There was bombing here last night , but nothing was hit , '' said Jumah Sayed , one of the civilians who had volunteered to guard the base . `` If one of these bunkers were hit , everything would be destroyed for miles around . '' Stacked floor to ceiling in bunkers at the site were crates of missiles , rockets , mortar rounds and other munitions of all calibres , orange dust lying thick on the crate lids . Zwei , whose base was less than a kilometre from Haniyeh , said he was sure the air force pilots were missing their targets deliberately . `` We have complete confidence in the Libyan air force not to hit anything that affects their relatives in the east . And we see it with bombing away from targets . This is proof they have honor , '' he said . Last week , two Libyan pilots flew their fighter planes to Malta and defected , rather than attack anti-Gaddafi forces . The United States said on Monday it was moving ships and planes closer to the country and Prime Minister David Cameron has said his government was working on preparation for the declaration of a `` no-fly '' zone to protect the Libyan people . Volunteers guarding Haniyeh , some carrying Kalashniknovs and rocket launchers , said they did not know how to use heavy weaponry at the site . Few of them appeared to be professional soldiers . The base comprises 35 bunkers . Three bunkers were seen by Reuters , as well as an adjoining hangar which a military expert said was packed with thousands of tonnes of munitions . Most of it appeared in good order , although many boxes had a manufacture date from the 1970s .

What Colonel Muammar Gaddafi actually has left to call on is a different matter . Here are some details of Libya 's armed forces , officially totaling around 76,000 active personnel , plus a reserve or people 's militia of some 40,000 . GROUND FORCES - STRENGTH ON PAPER : Numbers : 50,000 including 25,000 conscripts . Main Battle Tanks - 2,205 , including 180 T-90S and 200 T-62 . The rest are in store . Armored personnel carriers - 945 . Even before the uprising , Libya 's military strength was seen as having been seriously undermined by sanctions and neglect although Western powers had just began to sell it weapons again . Much of the equipment is seen as poorly maintained or unusable , leaving it hard to estimate genuine numbers . Analysts say Gaddafi tried to emasculate the regular army to avoid the emergence of commanders who might rival his immediate family , relying instead particularly on three loyal `` regime protection '' units often of his own tribe . That leaves him with what most estimate to be some 10-12 ,000 loyal Libyan troops . The most reliable formation is seen to be the 32nd Brigade commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis . Repeated reports from witnesses , rights groups and others talk of African mercenaries flown in by Gaddafi to help strengthen his government . Exact numbers are impossible to obtain . In Libya 's east around the city of Benghazi , regular military forces appear to have either defected to the opposition or melted away . Citizens groups also appear to have taken arms . But analysts say the opposition lacks much in the way of command and control or even any form of centralized leadership . So far , opposition units have focused primarily on defending territory and have shown little appetite to advance . That leaves loyalist forces trying to stem protest and perhaps regain lost territory in Libya 's west around Tripoli . The key coastal city of Sirte between Tripoli and Benghazi is still under government control and the east effectively lost . But experts warn the situation remains fluid . `` We underestimate the degree of loyalty in the security forces , '' warns Shashank Joshi , Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute . `` The defections appear to be patchwork and possibly along tribal lines . The units that matter , such as Khamis 's 32nd Brigade , are holding together . NAVY - STRENGTH ON PAPER Submarines - 2 patrol submarines . Libya 's two surviving Foxtrot class diesel submarines were delivered by the Soviet Union in the late 1980s , but outside experts have long questioned their reliability . According to IHS Jane 's , in 2003 one was reported to be in dry dock and one was sea going -- although unlikely to be fully operational . It suggested both might already have been abandoned . AIR FORCE - STRENGTH ON PAPER Combat capable aircraft - 374 . 227 fighter aircraft -- 13-Mirage F1-ED , 94 MiG-25 , 75 MiG-23 and 45 MiG-21 . Helicopters - 85 Support helicopters Analysts estimate many of Libya 's fast jets are in fact no longer airworthy . Gaddafi has so far also lost at least three aircraft in the course of this uprising with two jets defecting to Malta and the crew of a third ejecting over the desert rather than bomb opposition targets as ordered . Occasional reports have also spoken of the use of helicopter gunships , fuelling calls for foreign powers to impose a no-fly zone . There are also Air Defense Command forces which possess at least 216 surface-to-air missiles and 144 towed and 72 self propelled missiles . Again , maintenance may be an issue . Most analysts believe Libya 's armed forces would not be able to seriously threaten outside air forces attempting to enforce a no-fly zone , saying Gaddafi 's defense capabilities probably lag behind those of Iraq 's Saddam Hussein before the US-led 2003 invasion . The BBC reported a British RAF Hercules transport aircraft evacuating foreign nationals came under small arms fire this week but was not seriously damaged . Some suggested the attack might have come from opposition forces who mistook the plane for one of Gaddafi 's aircraft on a bombing raid . According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -LRB- OPCW -RRB- , Libya destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical weapons munitions in early 2004 as part of a rapprochement with the West that also saw it abandon a nuclear program . The OPCW told Reuters Libya did retain some 9.5 tons of deadly mustard gas at a secret desert location but no longer had the capability to deliver it .

American global leadership needs both resolve and resources , Clinton told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee . `` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos . The stakes are high , '' she said . `` The entire -LRB- Middle East -RRB- region is changing , and a strong and strategic American response will be essential . '' The turmoil in Libya , where Muammar Gaddafi is trying to crush a revolt , was an example of how Washington had to use its diplomatic and defense assets as well as development aid to `` protect our interests and advance our values , '' she told the lawmakers , some of whom want to cut overseas spending . Clinton spoke a day after the United States began moving warships and aircraft closer to Libya , and froze $ 30 billion in assets , steeping up pressure on Gaddafi to give up power . The U.S. Agency for International Development is sending two humanitarian teams to the region to help provide food and medicine to Libyans fleeing into Tunisia and Egypt . `` We are taking no options off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to turn its guns on its own people , '' she said . Clinton has just returned from Geneva , where she discussed Libya with other governments outraged over Gadaffi 's violent attempt to put down the rebellion against his 41-year rule . Clinton was invited to testify to the House panel in defense of President Barack Obama 's $ 47 billion budget request for the State Department and the USAID . That is up 1 percent from 2010 levels . Clinton called it a `` lean budget for lean times . '' Republicans , who took control of the House in November elections , have called for a tough new look at non-military overseas spending amid widespread calls to control the ballooning U.S. federal deficit . Clinton said Americans were justifiably concerned about the national debt but insisted they also wanted investments in the future , including diplomacy and aid to other countries . Retreating from international responsibilities often imposed long-term costs , she said , as happened in Afghanistan when the United States `` walked away '' after the Cold War ended and Soviet troops had gone home . `` We saved money in the short term . But those savings came at an unspeakable cost -- one we are still paying , 10 years later , in money and lives , '' she said . Obama has proposed spending almost $ 110 billion in 2012 on Afghanistan , where he has pledged to begin withdrawing the first of about 100,000 U.S. troops fighting Taliban insurgents by the middle of this year . Of this amount , about $ 107 billion is military spending . The State Department , mounting its own civilian `` surge '' aimed at stabilizing Afghanistan , would spend an extra $ 2.2 billion there as it seeks to increase assistance programs . `` Retreating from our civilian surge in Afghanistan -- with our troops still in the field -- would be a grave mistake , '' Clinton said . She said U.S. aid to Pakistan was `` equally important . '' Obama proposes maintaining significant aid to Pakistan to arm , train and equip its military to fight extremists with about $ 1.1 billion earmarked for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund , roughly the same level as last year . The Obama administration is launching its requests for the 2012 budget at a time when spending for 2011 is still not approved by Congress . Clinton said the 16 percent cut to the State Department and USAID included in a House-passed spending bill for 2011 last month would be `` devastating to our national security .

The United States said Libya could descend into civil war if Muammar Gaddafi refuses to quit , after word of unspecified Western military preparations . Gold has rallied strongly since political unrest sent U.S. light sweet oil futures soaring nearly $ 3 to just under $ 100 a barrel on Tuesday , driven by worries about supply disruptions . Wall Street lost over 1 percent as oil 's surge fanned concerns about a dampening effect on economic growth . Spot gold rallied to a record of $ 1,432.10 an ounce , surpassing its previous record of $ 1,430.95 set on December 7 . The metal gained 1.4 percent to $ 1,430.69 an ounce by 2:50 p.m. EST -LRB- 1950 GMT -RRB- , its largest one-day gain since January . U.S. April gold futures settled up 1.5 percent at $ 1,431.2 an ounce , with volume about 10 percent lower than its 30-day average and in line with lower-than-usual recent turnover . Bullion rose 6 percent in February , its largest monthly rise since August . It traded mostly sideways last week , then gained on Tuesday on resurgent safe-haven bids . Silver hit a fresh 31-year high at $ 34.59 an ounce and later climbed 2 percent to $ 34.46 . Silver has risen about 11 percent this year . The gold-silver ratio , which shows how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold , approached a 13-year low . Silver has risen amid limited supplies for near-term delivery and on prospects of rising demand for industrial metals as the economy recovers . Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the recent surge in oil prices was unlikely to have a big impact on the U.S. economy , but could dampen growth and raise inflation if sustained . Bernanke 's comments boosted gold as he offered no hint that the U.S. central bank was considering winding down its loose monetary policy , which also sent the U.S. dollar to a 3-1\\/2 month low against major currencies . `` From the start of crude oil 's ascent based on Libya , you are seeing general risk issues become more of a front burner in peoples ' psyche , '' said James Dailey , portfolio manager of the TEAM Asset Strategy Fund . O -RRB- `` You 've had the U.S. long-term Treasuries rally . You 've had a lot of the things that traditionally occur when people start to get afraid , all except the U.S. dollar rally , '' Dailey said . Since the Fed cut interest rates to 0.25 percent in response to the global financial crisis in late 2008 , gold has risen 70 percent . In a reflection of investor ambiguity toward gold at record prices , bullion held by SPDR Gold Trust , the world 's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund , fell a fifth consecutive month in February , marking its worst string of declines since the creation of the fund in 2004 . Platinum group metals investors took heart from news that U.S. auto sales rose more than 20 percent in February as the lure of discounts from automakers outweighed concerns about higher oil prices . Platinum gained 1.8 percent to $ 1,837 an ounce , while palladium climbed 2.5 percent to $ 814.22 an ounce .

A warplane bombed just outside the walls of the Haniyeh base on Monday before returning to attack again , striking close to a storage bunker inside the walls , according to an officer at the site who has joined the opposition to the Libyan leader . Military officers and other witnesses confirmed on Tuesday that the attack had taken place after the accuracy of the report was questioned . The United States said on Monday it was moving ships and planes closer to the country , and British Prime Minister David Cameron has said his government is working work to prepare a `` no-fly '' zone to protect the Libyan people . `` There was bombing here last night , but nothing was hit , '' said Jumah Sayed , one of the civilians who had volunteered to guard the base . `` If one of these bunkers were hit , everything would be destroyed for miles around . '' Mohammed Yusuf , the officer , said anti-aircraft guns were fired at the raiding warplane . Then at around 9 p.m. , defenders heard a helicopter . `` We attacked with anti-aircraft fire and it left without bombing anything , '' he told Reuters at the site . Another aircraft was heard at around 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday , added Saad Mahmoud , another officer who defected from Gaddafi 's military during a revolt that has put much of the Libya under rebel control . `` We fired randomly in the air and it left , '' he said . The rebels said the bomb which struck inside the walls of the base had landed in a minefield , making it impossible to independently check the blast site . The base comprises 35 bunkers . This correspondent was given access to one which a military expert said was packed with at least 10,000 tonnes of munitions of every caliber . Five tanks were also visible at the base .

Aid workers threw bottles of water and loaves of bread over the wall to a sea of men surging forward toward the safety of Tunisian soil , in a futile attempt to calm them . Young Tunisians with branches torn from the trees kept them from clambering over the wall between border posts . Tunisian officials were processing entrants as fast as they could , as medics plucked fainting men from the heaving mass sweeping over the chest-high steel gate . Panicking migrants passed their bulging suitcases , rugs , and blankets overhead at the gate where soldiers with sticks tried to hold them back . A Tunisian officer with a loud hailer shouted reassurances that they would be let in . Order looked close to collapse at one brief point in the overflowing border compound on the Tunisian side , where throngs of men jostled and long lines of exhausted migrants in torn jackets and headcloths queued for water , food , and toilets . Troops fired warning shots in the air and white-faced officers unholstered their automatic pistols . Many tens of thousands more are expected to flee west from the violence that has consumed Liby as Gaddafi 's regime teeters on the verge of collapse . `` We ca n't see beyond that building on the Libyan side but we think there are many more waiting to come through , '' said Ayman Gharaibeh , team leader for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- at Ras Jdir . `` The numbers are daunting , '' he said . The last couple of days had seen an upsurge and refugees were now crossing at a rate of up to 15,000 a day , he said . There was no one to coordinate relief and establish order on the Libyan side and the UNHCR judged it was not safe to go over there . Medecins sans Frontieres and the Red Cross-Red Crescent were trying to liaise with the Libyans to slow the flow . `` It looks like it 's going to get worse ... They are going to break down the wall in the end , '' said Gharaibeh grimly . In the mass of people behind the wall on the Libyan side , Bangladeshis held up a sheet with the words : `` Help Help Help . '' In the Tunisian compound , a few hundred Vietnamese squatted stoically , waiting their turn to be bussed out and home . About 70,000 refugees had entered Tunisia since the uprising began in Libya and only an estimated 20 percent had been repatriated , the UNHCR team-leader said . Tunisia 's capacity to feed , shelter and provide sanitation for the destitute workers is being pushed to breaking point . The UN agency built a transit camp of hundreds of white tents overnight about 7 km -LRB- 4 miles -RRB- back from the border , with the capacity to provide temporary relief for up to 20,000 . `` When are we going to be taken out of here ? We can not accept this , '' said one Egyptian . `` Give me a camel . I will take a camel . I just want to go home . '' Evacuation flights were picking up refugees from Djerba airport in the plush beach resort area in the north of Tunisia , a world away from the chaos . Ships have taken boatloads away from the port of Zarzis but not nearly fast enough to ease the pressure , said Tunisian army Colonel Mohamed Essoussi . `` We need the most rapid possible evacuation , '' he said . `` The major weaknesses are in transport , air and maritime transport . '' The emergency shelters and transit camp could handle 5,000 a day , he said . `` We are now feeding 17,000 people . '' International aid agencies at the scene agreed with the assessment . Tunisia 's capacity to shelter the flow was at its limit . They said faster evacuation was needed and control on the Libyan side would greatly ease the crisis . However , there appeared to be almost no one with the power and authority to achieve order there , the UNHCR said . Thousands have no money to pay for their passage home , and no employer responsible for their repatriation . Many have been sleeping out in the open for days in cold , wet conditions . As the sun went down and rain clouds approached , campfires flickered under a grove of trees at the border , where hundreds of refugees huddled in shelters built of their baggage , under blankets and plastic sheeting .

Gaddafi , who said no more than 150 people were killed in the unrest caused by `` terrorists , '' told a loyal audience in an address shown on state television that if the United States or foreign powers entered Libya they would face a bloody war . The Libyan leader said he was willing to discuss constitutional and legal change without arms or chaos and was ready to talk with al Qaeda if they had demands . `` There is a conspiracy to control the Libyan oil and to control the Libyan land , to colonize Libya once again , '' he said . `` This is impossible , impossible . We will fight until the last man and last woman to defend Libya from east to west , north to south , '' Gaddafi told his supporters who punctuated the address with cheers of support and declarations of loyalty . `` You will remain great ! '' chanted the crowd to Gaddafi , who was full of confidence and vigor but apparently in denial about swathes of Libya occupied by anti-Gaddafi rebels . `` We will enter a bloody war and thousands and thousands of Libyans will die if the United States enters or NATO enters '' Gaddafi said . On the sequence of events that started the unrest , Gaddafi , who in a previous speech said protesters against his rule were brain-washed by Osama bin Laden and had their milk and Nescafe spiked with hallucinogenic drugs , said : `` How did that all begin ? Small , sleeper al Qaeda cells . '' Wearing long , white robes , a brown head-dress and gesticulating , Gaddafi said : `` Al Qaeda 's cells attacked security forces and took over their weapons ... After Bayda , the Qaeda cells moved to Benghazi and Derna . '' Gaddafi , 68 , said there were no protests against his rule in Libya and that `` underground groups '' were whipping people up and reports by the media to the contrary were wrong . There were no political prisoners in Libya , he said . The international community should set up a fact-finding committee to find out just how many people had been killed in the Libyan unrest and accusations against Libya , he said . `` I dare you to find that peaceful protesters were killed . in America , France , and everywhere , if people attacked military storage depots and tried to steal weapons , they will shoot them , '' Gaddafi said .

TRIPOLI | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 12:27 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya could descend into civil war unless Muammar Gaddafi quits , the United States said on Tuesday , its demand for his departure intensifying pressure on the longtime leader after news of Western military preparations . But Gaddafi remained defiant , dispatching forces to a western border area amid fears that the most violent Arab revolt may grow bloodier and spark a humanitarian crisis . His son , Saif al-Islam , warned the West against launching any military action to topple Gaddafi , and said the veteran ruler would not step down or go into exile . `` Using force against Libya is not acceptable . There 's no reason , but if they want ... we are ready , we are not afraid , '' he told Sky television , adding : `` We live here , we die here . '' In Moscow , a Kremlin source suggested Gaddafi , whose authority has unravelled in much of the vast desert country , should step down , calling him a `` living political corpse '' . In prepared testimony to U.S. lawmakers in Washington , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said : `` Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war . '' The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , said Washington would apply pressure on Gaddafi until he bows out , working to stabilise oil prices and avert a humanitarian crisis . She stopped short of saying the Obama administration was ready to impose a no-fly zone over Libya that would prevent Gaddafi using aircraft against rebels fighting against him . On Monday the United States said it was moving ships and planes closer to the oil-producing North African state . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sounded a note of caution , saying foreign military intervention in Libya would not happen without a clear United Nations mandate . British Prime Minister David Cameron said it was unacceptable that `` Colonel Gaddafi can be murdering his own people using airplanes and helicopter gunships . '' General James Mattis , commander of U.S. Central Command , told a Senate hearing that imposing a no-fly zone would be a `` challenging '' operation that would mean actual attack . `` You would have to remove air defense capability in order to establish a no-fly zone , so no illusions here , '' he said . `` It would be a military operation -- it would n't be just telling people not to fly airplanes . '' Analysts said Western leaders are in no mood to rush into conflict after the troubled , drawn-out involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq . `` They will be desperate not to place themselves in that situation , unless not doing so would result in even worse massacres , '' said Shashank Joshi of London 's Royal United Services Institute . Suspicions grew that Gaddafi , a survivor of past coup attempts , did not grasp the scale of the forces against him . `` All my people love me , '' he told the U.S. ABC network and the BBC on Monday , dismissing the significance of a rebellion that has ended his control over much of oil-rich eastern Libya . Rebel fighters claimed the balance of the conflict was swinging their way . `` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a spokesman in Zawiyah , only 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . A rebel army officer in the eastern city of Ajdabiyah said rebel units were becoming more organised . `` All the military councils of Free Libya are meeting to form a unified military council to plan an attack on Gaddafi security units , militias and mercenaries , '' Captain Faris Zwei said . But despite the widespread collapse of Gaddafi 's writ , his forces were fighting back in some regions . A reporter on the Tunisian border saw Libyan troops reassert control at a crossing that was abandoned on Monday , and residents of Nalut , about 60 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- from the border , said pro-Gaddafi forces deployed to retake control there . Mohamed , a resident of rebel-held Misrata , told Reuters by phone : `` Symbols of Gaddafi 's regime have been swept away from the city . Only a -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- battalion remains at the city 's air base but they appear to be willing to negotiate safe exit out of the air base . We are not sure if this is genuine or just a trick to attack the city again . '' Tripoli is Gaddafi 's last stronghold . Tribal leaders , officials , military officers and army units have defected to the rebels . Sanctions will squeeze his access to funds . Around the Libyan capital there were queues outside bread shops on Tuesday morning . Some residents said many shops were limiting the number of loaves customers could buy . `` The situation is nervous , '' said Salah , a doctor . `` Of course I am worried . My family is afraid . They are waiting at home . We have been hearing gunfire . '' A Tripoli resident said the main state television station , Jamahiriya , was no longer available on its usual satellite channel . He said Libiya , another of Libya 's three television stations , which are all state controlled , had told viewers Jamahiriya 's signal was being subjected to interference . It was not clear if the interference was linked to a campaign , led by Libyan exile groups , to persuade satellite television operators to stop carrying Libyan television . In the opposition bastion of Benghazi , residents said food and other necessities were in good supply . In Geneva , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on world powers to fully implement a U.N. Security Council resolution on Libya . The text , adopted on Saturday , includes a freeze on Muammar Gaddafi 's assets and travel ban and refers his regime 's brutal crackdown to the International Criminal Court . Libya 's National Oil Corporation said output had halved because of the departure of foreign workers . Brent crude prices pushed back above $ 114 a barrel as supply disruptions and the potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa kept investors on edge . At Ras Jdir on the border with Tunisia , Tunisian border guards fired into the air to try to control a crowd of people clamouring to get through a frontier crossing to escape the violence in Libya . About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir frontier crossing in the past two weeks , and in the last few days the rate has increased to up to 15,000 per day , said Ayman Gharaibeh , an officer with the U.N. refugee agency . Revolutions in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt have helped to ignite resentment of four decades of often bloody political repression under Gaddafi as well as his failure to use Libyan oil wealth to tackle widespread poverty and lack of opportunity .

Under its contingency plans , the WFP has re-routed shipments of wheat and flour to the Tunisian border and the Libyan port of Benghazi . `` We are planning for a three-month emergency operation that will help shore up Egyptian and Tunisian food safety nets and will also purchase food from the region to help ensure that recovery from the disruption can begin immediately , '' she said . Thousands of migrant workers desperate to leave Libya are stranded at the border with Tunisia , sleeping in the open and getting little if any assistance . Meanwhile , WFP says it is also worried about the food situation within the country . `` People arriving at the crossing are reporting that food availability varies from town to town . Food is scarce in some parts of the country , '' WFP spokeswoman Abeer Etefa said by phone from the border . Food shortages were reported in Zawiyah , a city 50 km west of Tripoli held by rebels but surrounded by pro-Gaddafi forces , where some refugees said the price of bread had gone up 20 percent . Libya relies on imports for over 90 percent of its food . `` It 's clear that the turmoil and the fact that roads are not safe are putting pressure on food supplies , '' Etefa said . The WFP dispatched a team to Benghazi on Wednesday to check if the port was safe for food deliveries and inspect the food supply situation there . -LRB- Reporting by Silvia Aloisi in Tunis and Svetlana Kovalyova in Rome , editing by Keiron Henderson -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "282", "dct": "2011-03-02", "dates": ["2011-03-02", "2011-03-02", "2006-01-01", "2003-01-01", "2006-01-01", "2005-12-28"], "text": "WASHINGTON | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 4:21 pm GMT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An unpublished U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks tells the previously undisclosed story of how an American corporate powerhouse -- the $ 35-billion -LRB- 21 billion pounds -RRB- Coca-Cola Co. -LRB- KO . N -RRB- -- got caught up in a fierce fraternal dispute between two of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's sons . The contretemps among the freres Gaddafi over a local bottling plant escalated into a heavily armed confrontation resembling a Hollywood gangster film , as a classified 2006 U.S. cable put it . `` You know the movie ` The Godfather ' ? We 've been living it for the last few months , '' a businessman involved in the dispute was quoted in the cable as telling an official from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tripoli . The cable , which was made available to Reuters by a third party , centres on a bottling plant in Tripoli that was shut down for three months . It had been seized by troops loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , a son of Muammar , who at the time was feuding with one of his brothers , Mohammed . -LRB- Another State Department cable suggests a third Gaddafi son , Saadi -- better known as the family 's professional soccer player -- may also have been involved in the squabble , though no details of his role are given . -RRB- Eventually , the American diplomatic mission in Tripoli , known then as the U.S. Liaison Office , sent a firm protest to the Libyan government . The document states that around the same time , Mohammed Gaddafi , possibly under pressure from his sister Aisha , a family peacemaker , apparently agreed that shares owned by the Libyan Olympic Committee , which he led , would be sold to a third party . Shortly afterward , the cable says , Mutassim 's men left the Coke plant , ending the family standoff , but not before employees of the plant received threats of bodily harm and a Gaddafi cousin was stuffed in the trunk of a car . The Coca-Cola confrontation is among numerous tales about endless squabbling within the Gaddafi clan recounted in State Department cables . Among other things , the incident underlines the difficulties faced by foreign companies operating in Libya even after the U.S. and United Nations began to scale back sanctions following Muammar Gaddafi 's decision in late 2003 to abandon his nuclear weapons program . A spokesman for Coca-Cola acknowledged there had been `` some uncertainty '' surrounding Coke distribution arrangements in Libya during the period described in the cable . But the problem was `` resolved amicably '' by the end of 2006 , the spokesman said , and since then , Coca-Cola had been operating normally in Libya until the onset of the current unrest . A spokesman for the State Department said : `` We will decline to comment on any particular cable . The U.S. has taken aggressive action in recent days to freeze the assets of the Qaddafi family . Thus far , more than $ 30 billion in assets have been blocked . '' WORKERS THREATENED , PLANT MATERIALS DESTROYED Back when Libya was isolated by economic sanctions , its Coca-Cola supply was limited to consignments of the beverage bottled at a plant in Tunisia and transported to Tripoli and Benghazi . After U.S. and international trade embargoes on Libya began to ease , the Tripoli plant was established . It was co-owned by what the cable describes as a British company called Ka'Mur -- whose name was a reference to two embargo-era Libyan soft-drinks -- and by the Libyan Olympic Committee , headed by Mohammed Gaddafi . Immediately after this joint venture was set up , the State Department cable says , the embargo-era Libyan distributor of bottled Coke sued the group behind the newly-opened plant , alleging breach of contract . A complaint was also sent to Coca Cola International alleging that the bottling plant operators had `` stolen the franchise '' from the previous distributors , according to the cable . The bottling plant operators counter-sued . Then , on December 28 , 2005 -- two weeks after the Tripoli plant began turning out locally-bottled batches of Coke -- `` two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility , asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant , '' according to an account of the incident a businessman gave to U.S. diplomats . The U.S. mission in Libya learned from other sources that the troops were loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , who , after the Coca-Cola dispute was resolved , was named Libya 's national security adviser . According to the State Department cable , Mutassim bore a grudge against his brother because he had `` taken over '' the embargo-era domestic soft-drink business in the late 1990s when Mutassim had been exiled to Egypt for `` insubordination '' against their father . -LRB- Another cable says the `` rumor '' was that Mutassim had been linked to a coup attempt . -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "325", "dct": "2011-03-02", "dates": ["2011-03-02", "2011-03-02", "2011-03-02", "2011-03-02", "1977-01-01", "2011-02-01", "2003-01-01", "2011-03-02"], "text": "BREGA , Libya | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 6:43 pm EST BREGA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels repulsed a land and air offensive by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on Wednesday as the defiant leader warned foreign powers of `` another Vietnam '' if they intervened . The U.S. government is already cautious about the prospect of imposing a `` no-fly zone '' over Libya , stressing the diplomatic and military risks involved , but has nevertheless moved two amphibious assault ships into the Mediterranean . Rebels in their eastern bastion of Benghazi have called for U.N.-backed air strikes to halt attacks by African mercenaries they say Gaddafi is using against his own people . Government troops , backed by air power , launched a dawn attack on Wednesday and briefly captured Brega , an oil export terminal 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . But opposition forces counter-attacked and took back the town they held for about a week , rebel officers said . They were ready to move west toward the capital , they said , if Gaddafi refuses to quit . Basking in the adulation of loyalists in Tripoli , Libya 's leader for the last 41 years , launched into a tirade against the `` armed gangsters '' he said were behind the unrest , part of a conspiracy to colonize Libya and seize its oil . `` We will enter a bloody war and thousands and thousands of Libyans will die if the United States enters or NATO enters , '' Gaddafi told Tripoli supporters at a gathering televised live . `` We are ready to hand out weapons to a million , or 2 million or 3 million , and another Vietnam will begin . It does n't matter to us . We no longer care about anything . '' Further bombing raids struck near the oil terminal in the afternoon . Estimates of the death toll during the day ranged between five and 14 . Oil prices surged to near recent 2-1\\/2 year highs due to fears the unrest could spread to other OPEC producers . Gaddafi , who once said ballot box democracy was for donkeys , told the gathering in Tripoli the world did not understand he had given power to the people long ago . `` We put our fingers in the eyes of those who doubt that Libya is ruled by anyone other than its people , '' he said , referring to his system of `` direct democracy '' launched at a meeting attended by visiting Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 1977 . A Tripoli resident and Gaddafi opponent , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters afterwards : `` Gaddafi will hang on for a while . It 's not going to be easy for an unarmed crowd to face highly armed forces eager to shoot their own people . '' The assault on Brega appeared to be the most significant military operation by Gaddafi since the uprising erupted in mid-February and set off a confrontation that Washington says could descend into a long civil war unless Gaddafi steps down . Witnesses said the attack was backed by heavy weapons and air strikes . One of the witnesses said Gaddafi 's forces were 2-3 km from the city center and had 300-350 rebels pinned down at an oil industry airport on the city outskirts . Hisham Mohammed , a 33-year-old mechanic on the side of the rebels , was defiant . `` I 'm going to Brega to help our brothers there . I 'm washed , I 've prayed , and I 'm ready to go to God , '' he told Reuters . Analysts cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from fast moving events in a situation of erratic communications . `` The attack reinforces the idea that the government is capable of projecting power far into the east , '' said Shashank Joshi , an analyst at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute . `` But we should keep in mind that both the government and the rebels are trying to spin an image of momentum . '' In Benghazi , the rebel National Libyan Council called for air strikes . `` We call for specific attacks on strongholds of these mercenaries , '' said council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga . `` The presence of any foreign forces on Libyan soil is strongly opposed . There is a big difference between this and strategic air strikes . '' In a possible response to Western hints that the opposition needs to unify to facilitate rebel links with outside powers , Ghoga added that a former justice minister , Mustafa Abdel , Jalil , would be chairman of the Council which will have 30 members and be based in Benghazi before moving later to Tripoli . Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , one of the first Libyan diplomats to denounce leader Muammar Gaddafi and defect , said the U.N. may back a resolution for a no-fly zone if the National Libyan Council officially requested it . Any sort of foreign military involvement in Arab countries is a sensitive topic for Western nations uncomfortably aware that Iraq suffered years of bloodletting and al Qaeda violence after a 2003 U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein . The Arab League said it was against direct outside military intervention , but could enforce a no-fly zone over Libya in cooperation with the African Union . Realistically though , only the United States could carry out such an operation . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said U.S. military assets could be used to support the movement of supplies to areas in need but a no-fly zone was not an immediate priority . `` I think we are a long way from making that decision , '' Clinton told a Senate hearing . `` There is a great deal of caution that is being exercised with respect to any action we might take other than in support of humanitarian missions . '' Two U.S. amphibious assault ships , the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ponce , passed through Egypt 's Suez Canal and arrived in the Mediterranean on Wednesday . The White House said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts but stressed it `` was not taking any options off the table . '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said : `` Our job is to give the president the broadest possible decision space . '' But he said that enforcing a no-fly zone meant first attacking and destroying Libyan air defenses . `` A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses ... Then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down , '' Gates told a congressional hearing . The uprising , the bloodiest yet against long-serving rulers in the Middle East , is causing a humanitarian crisis , especially on the Tunisian border where thousands of foreign workers are trying to flee to safety . At Ras Jdir on the Tunisia border , thousands of Bangladeshi migrant workers , desperate to leave Libya , pressed up against the gates of the frontier crossing , angry at their government for sending no help . Groups of West African migrant workers also in the crowd chanted for help and held up the flags of Ghana and Nigeria . About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir border post in the past two weeks , and many more of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in Libya are expected to follow .

A quarter of about 18,000 Indians , most of them employed in the oil , construction and health sectors in Libya , have been brought out after the government chartered cruise ships , and through special flights of the state carrier Air India . China , meanwhile , evacuated 32,000 of its citizens in an operation involving four heavy-lift IL-76 military aircraft , chartered aircraft and a navy frigate . The United States has already completed evacuation operations , with the last Americans flying out of the besieged capital Tripoli on Friday . `` We are not in competition with China here . We 're focused on the task of bringing back our people safe and sound . Please let 's not devalue this , '' Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said in a tweet as concerns increased about the fate of Indians stranded in the North African country . The United States said Libya could sink into civil war unless long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi quits amid fears that the uprising , the bloodiest against long-serving rulers in the Middle East , could cause a humanitarian crisis . The Indian navy has sent three ships to help in the evacuation but they will take a week to reach Libya . A Defense Ministry official said the air force was on stand-by to deploy IL-76 aircraft to rescue Indians stranded in the interior of Libya , but it would need overflight clearance from a host of countries . `` Out of Libya India crawls , the rest are safe at home , '' the Indian Express said , adding India remained the only major country with thousands of nationals stranded there . On Tuesday , Indian Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna spoke to his Libyan counterpart , Moussa Koussa , seeking help to evacuate Indians . The Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was looking at setting up air bridges with the cities of Sirte in the east and Sebha in the south to fly citizens out .

Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari , in opening remarks to an Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo on Wednesday , said the Libyan leadership must make brave decisions to stop violence and respect the `` legitimate rights '' of the people . The Cairo-based Arab League has suspended Libya 's participation in condemnation of a violent crackdown by Gaddafi forces against protests that have grown into a rebellion against his rule . Zebari called on the ministers to stand in silence in memory of Arabs killed in a wave of pro-reform protests that have swept the leaders of Egypt and Tunisia from power and are challenging the rule of others in Bahrain and Yemen , as well as Libya . `` We hope the Libyan people can overcome these difficult conditions , and that the Libyan leaders take brave stands to stop bloodshed and respect the legitimate desires and rights of its people to live in a free , democratic nation , '' Zebari said . He said the Arabs confirmed their `` desire for no foreign intervention '' in Libya , whose seat stood empty at the Cairo meeting . A draft resolution drawn up by Arab League representatives on Tuesday stated the Arabs ' rejection of `` any foreign military intervention in Libya '' and stressed `` the unity and integrity of Libyan soil .

Full Article ANALYSIS - Could Libya war crimes talk just entrench Gaddafi ? LONDON | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 6:54 pm IST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Foreign powers hope threatening Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi with a war crimes trial at The Hague will help drive him from office , but some worry such talk might instead leave him thinking he has no way out . The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to refer Libya to the International Criminal Court following its crackdown on protesters . ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said on Monday attacks on civilians could be a crime against humanity and warranted a full investigation . But -- just as with previous ICC probes into Congolese warlords , Sudan 's president and Uganda 's Lord 's Resistance Army -- there is the lingering worry that prosecutions will make compromise and finding a solution harder . Part of the problem , experts say , is that there is simply no real way to know what impact the threat will have on Libya 's always somewhat erratic leader . `` It 's a difficult balancing act , '' said Alia Brahimi , a research fellow on North Africa at the London School of Economics . `` There is a risk that taking an absolute moral and legalistic approach and talking about war crimes charges simply reinforces Gaddafi 's idea that he has nowhere else to go and no option to step down . But on the flip side , it sends a strong message to those around him . '' Homegrown amnesty , truth and reconciliation processes -- rather than international prosecutions -- have been key to the resolution of several political crises or conflicts once thought intractable , such as the conflict between South Africa 's white apartheid rulers and the black majority . Many also doubt Northern Ireland 's decades of violence could have been brought hopefully to a close if Britain had still been looking to prosecute sometime IRA militants . A week into Libya 's uprising , the country is effectively divided between Gaddafi loyalist and opposition forces in what some fear could be the opening stages of a civil war . Foreign governments say hundreds if not thousands have been killed already , while aid agencies fear a humanitarian crisis . Outside powers demand that Gaddafi stand down , threatening no-fly zones , sanctions and possibly further military action -- although critics say that can also back intransigent rulers into a corner . But the foreign powers say the risk of war crimes charges should deter followers from attacking civilians and might help prompt his ouster . `` International prosecutions can sometimes carry risks , such as causing brutal dictators to entrench rather than step down and face justice , '' said Matthew Waxman , professor at Columbia Law School and fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations . `` However , -LRB- they -RRB- can also help isolate perpetrators ... hastening their demise while also laying the foundation for longer term stability and serving broader interests in justice and deterrence . '' It is possible any war crimes prosecution could still be halted in its tracks if foreign powers chose to do so . Interviewed by Reuters in 2005 shortly before the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the head of Uganda 's LRA leader Joseph Kony , prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo said he might in general agree to halting proceedings in a country if that would bring peace . Some in Uganda and elsewhere had warned that issuing warrants against the LRA for child abduction and killing might make it impossible to reach an agreement with them . Kony ultimately refused to sign a peace deal after talks hosted by South Sudan , some say because he feared ICC prosecution . He and his fighters fled into nearby Congo and are still at large , continuing to raid villages there and in Sudan . But Human Rights Watch 's head of the international justice program , Richard Dicker , said it was now barely even legally possible to simply cancel proceedings . `` The world has changed with the passing of the Rome Statute , '' he said , referring to the 2002 treaty establishing the ICC . `` There 's just not the legal option to offer ... to stop the legal process . The option of letting Gaddafi walk away without any legal consequences just is n't on the table any more . '' In reality , international justice remains likely to be highly selective . Any one of the permanent five UN Security Council members of the U.S. , Britain , France , Russia or China can effectively block a probe . That means Chinese actions in Tibet and elsewhere , Russian clampdowns in Chechnya or alleged Western abuses in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay are all off the agenda . Close friends of Security Council powers such as U.S. ally Israel or China 's friends Myanmar or Sri Lanka also tend to enjoy more diplomatic cover . `` It 's a far from perfect system ... an uneven playing field , '' said Human Rights Watch 's Dicker . `` But I believe ... we are moving in the right direction . If you look at eastern Congo , you have warlords who have been given amnesty time and time again ... in a short-term search for peace . They have returned to commit even more vicious atrocities . You have to have systems that will bring justice . '' Others say that -- like the threat of economic sanctions or military action -- at the end of the day the prosecution threat may simply become another diplomatic bargaining chip . `` A war crimes indictment demonstrates the resolve of the international community , '' said Thomas Barnett , chief analyst of political risk consultancy Wikistrat . `` To the extent that it pushes an embattled leader into a corner , it can likewise be retracted as part of the collective bargaining for an acceptable exit scenario for the leader , his family and top associates .

Full Article U.S. warships move through Suez , Gaddafi defiant TRIPOLI | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 3:32 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Two U.S. warships were passing through the Suez Canal on their way to waters off Libya on Wednesday as Western nations exerted diplomatic and military pressure on Muammar Gaddafi to step down . The United States said Libya could sink into civil war unless the Libyan leader ends his four-decade rule amid fears that the uprising , the bloodiest yet against long-serving rulers in the Middle East , could cause a humanitarian crisis . Gaddafi is defiant and his son , Saif al-Islam , has warned the West against launching military action . He said the veteran ruler would not relinquish power or be driven into exile . Across Libya , tribal leaders , officials , military officers and army units have defected to the rebel cause and say they are becoming more organised . Tripoli is a stronghold for Gaddafi in this oil-producing north African state . `` We are going to keep the pressure on Gaddafi until he steps down and allows the people of Libya to express themselves freely and determine their own future , '' Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' . Captain Faris Zwei , among officers in the east who joined the opposition to Gaddafi , said there were more than 10,000 volunteers in Ajdabiyah , 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- from the capital . `` We are reorganising the army , which was almost completely destroyed by Gaddafi and his gang before they left , '' he said . `` We are reforming , as much as we can , the army from the youth that took part in the revolution . '' Two amphibious assault ships , USS Kearsarge , which can carry 2,000 Marines , and USS Ponce , entered the canal on Wednesday en route to the Mediterranean . The destroyer USS Barry moved through the Suez Canal on Monday . The ships entered through the southern end of the canal , an official said , adding that they were expected to pass through by 3:30 p.m. -LRB- 1330 GMT -RRB- or 4:00 p.m. local time . Arab League foreign ministers meet on Wednesday at an extraordinary session in Cairo and are expected to reinforce their condemnation of Gaddafi . Some delegates want the meeting to underline the League 's unwillingness to see foreign intervention in Libya . `` We are looking at a lot of options and contingencies . No decisions have been made on any other actions , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , noting the United Nations had not authorised the use of force in Libya . Italy said it was sending a humanitarian mission to Tunisia to provide food and medical aid to as many as 10,000 people who had fled violence in Libya on its eastern border . Tunisian border guards fired into the air on Tuesday to try to control a desperate crowd clamouring to cross the frontier . About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir border post in the past two weeks , and many more of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in Libya are expected to follow . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said : `` Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war . '' The U.S. Senate , in a unanimous vote , approved a resolution `` strongly condemning the gross and systematic violation of human rights in Libya , including violent attacks on protesters demanding democratic reforms '' . The White House said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts but stressed it `` was not taking any options off the table '' . Gates said : `` Our job is to give the president the broadest possible decision space . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sounded a note of caution , saying military intervention would not happen without a clear United Nations mandate . British Prime Minister David Cameron , who said Britain would work with allies on preparations for a no-fly zone over Libya , said it was unacceptable that `` Colonel Gaddafi can be murdering his own people using airplanes and helicopter gunships '' . General James Mattis , commander of U.S. Central Command , told a Senate hearing that imposing a no-fly zone would be a `` challenging '' operation . `` You would have to remove air defense capability in order to establish a no-fly zone , so no illusions here , '' he said . `` It would be a military operation . '' Analysts said Western leaders were in no mood to rush into conflict after drawn-out involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq . The U.N. General Assembly unanimously suspended Libya 's membership of the the U.N. Human Rights Council because of violence by Gaddafi 's forces . Gaddafi , a survivor of past coup attempts , has told television networks : `` All my people love me , '' dismissing the significance of the rebellion that has ended his control over much of oil-rich eastern Libya . The Libyan leader has , however , faced defections from soldiers , diplomats and ministers . Gaddafi replaced two of his ministers who had defected to support the uprising seeking to oust him , Libyan state television said on Wednesday . Rebel fighters said the balance of the conflict was swinging their way . `` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a spokesman in Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . The rebel army officer in the eastern city of Ajdabiyah said rebel units were becoming more organised . `` All the military councils of Free Libya are meeting to form a unified military council to plan an attack on Gaddafi security units , militias and mercenaries , '' Captain Zwei said . Despite the widespread collapse of Gaddafi 's rule , his forces were fighting back in some regions . A reporter on the Tunisian border saw Libyan troops reassert control at a crossing abandoned on Monday , and residents of Nalut , about 60 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- from the border , said they feared pro-Gaddafi forces were planning to recapture the town . Mohamed , a resident of rebel-held Misrata , told Reuters by phone : `` Symbols of Gaddafi 's regime have been swept away from the city . Only a -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- battalion remains at the city 's air base but they appear to be willing to negotiate safe exit out of the air base . We are not sure if this is genuine or just a trick to attack the city again . '' Many on the streets of Tripoli on Tuesday expressed loyalty , but a man who described himself as a military pilot said : `` One hundred percent of Libyans do n't like him . '' The U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday unanimously suspended Libya 's membership of the U.N. Human Rights Council . A U.N. Security Council resolution on Saturday called for a freeze on Gaddafi 's assets and a travel ban and refers his crackdown to the International Criminal Court . The United States has frozen $ 30 billion in Libyan assets . Libya 's National Oil Corp said output had halved due to the departure of foreign workers . Brent crude surged above $ 116 a barrel on Tuesday as supply disruptions and potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa kept investors edgy .

Full Article Global war crimes court to investigate Gaddafi THE HAGUE | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 10:52 pm IST THE HAGUE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The international war crimes tribunal said on Thursday it would investigate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , his sons and members of their inner circle for crimes committed by their security forces . Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo of the Hague-based International Criminal Court , pointing to a bloody crackdown on demonstrators against Gaddafi 's rule in which thousands may have died , said that no one had the authority to massacre civilians . He said the court would investigate `` serious crimes '' and had identified several people at the top of the command chain who could be investigated . `` They are Muammar Gaddafi , his inner circle including some of his sons , who had de facto authority , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . If opposition groups also have weapons and commit crimes , their leaders will also be investigated . `` We will act with impartiality , '' he said . The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Gaddafi and his family on Saturday , and referred Libya 's crackdown on demonstrators to the court . Gaddafi has vowed to stay in Libya and fight to the death since protests against his 41-year rule began in mid-February , inspired by the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt that ousted longstanding authoritarian rulers . The prosecutor said air strikes and attacks , alleged to have been made by security forces , and illegal detentions of hundreds of people would be investigated , including violence in the eastern city of Benghazi on Feb. 15 and attacks in the capital Tripoli on Feb. 20 . `` No one has the authority to attack and massacre civilians , '' Moreno-Ocampo said , adding that he could request the issue of arrest warrants over the atrocities in a few months ' time . Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim called the probe `` close to a joke '' since no fact-finding mission had been sent to his country , and said it was based purely on media reports . `` We have armed gangs having tanks , aircraft and machineguns and attacking police stations , army camps , ports and airports and occupying Libyan cities . This is far away from a peaceful movement , '' he told BBC radio . Khaled Kaim , deputy Libyan foreign minister , told Al Arabiya `` We are not under the jurisdiction of the court , we are not signatories ... The court has no power over Libya . '' Other people in Gaddafi 's circle who will come under the court 's scrutiny include the commander of the 32nd brigade , foreign mercenaries , a government spokesman and the National Security Adviser , Moreno-Ocampo said . He did not name them but said the inner circle included some of Gaddafi 's sons . The 32nd brigade leader is Gaddafi 's son Khamis . Outside that circle , he pointed to the head of Gaddafi 's personal security , the director general of the Libyan External Security Organisation , the head of the Security Forces and other organization leaders as potential suspects . Earlier on Thursday , Gaddafi 's forces struck at rebel control of oil export hubs in eastern Libya for a second day as Arab states weighed a plan to end the turmoil . Rebels are also calling for a no-fly zone , echoing a demand by Libya 's deputy U.N. envoy , who now opposes Gaddafi .

Bill Pace , head of a coalition of NGOs that support the work of the court , said the Security Council and member states should now stand by the referral and ensure that arrests are made . `` The involvement of the ICC indicates that crimes of grave concern will not be tolerated , '' Pace said . -LRB- Reporting by Aaron Gray-Block ; additional reporting by Stefano Ambrogi ; editing by Sara Webb and Tim Pearce -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "204", "dct": "2011-03-03", "dates": ["2011-03-03", "2011-03-03", "2011-03-03", "2011-02-28"], "text": "Libya unrest costs Russia $ 4 billion in arms deals : media MOSCOW | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 8:55 am EST MOSCOW -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Russia will lose $ 4 billion in arms deals due to unrest in Libya , Russian news agencies quoted Sergei Chemezov , head of the state holding company that controls weapons exports , as saying on Thursday .

Libya 's battle lines are shifting daily , with rebels in tenuous control of the east , but the fighting is increasingly taking place near oil industry infrastructure on the coast . Since unrest began weeks ago in the North African country , which typically pumps around 1.6 million barrels a day -LRB- bpd -RRB- , around 750,000 bpd has been shut in as workers flee . The disruptions helped push Brent crude prices to 30-month highs this week near $ 118 a barrel . But so far , the conflict has spared Libya 's oil infrastructure , including its key export terminals , pipelines and well equipment , worth billions . As the stand-off devolves into what looks increasingly like a civil war , oil experts and analysts are seeing an increasing risk of long-lasting damage to Libya 's largely foreign-run oil sector , which could keep oil prices high for a long time . The stakes are clear . Libya holds Africa 's largest oil reserves , and crude shipments account for 95 percent of its export revenues . Neither Gaddafi nor rebels want to see the spoils fall into enemy hands . European refiners , especially in Italy , rely heavily on Libya 's prized light crude . But both the Gaddafi regime and rebels have said publicly they will not seek to destroy oil infrastructure . No damage to oil infrastructure was reported Wednesday and Thursday , when Gaddafi-loyal air force fighters attacked oil export hub town Brega . The town , currently in rebel hands , has passed back and forth between regime and rebel control in recent days . `` It has become likely that Libyan fighting will affect , and potentially destroy , oil infrastructure serving the country 's largest , central Sirte basin , which is right on the fault line between Gaddafi loyalists and rebels , '' said Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East analyst at IHS Energy in London . Gaddafi loyalists , who briefly captured Brega Wednesday , have since been repelled back to Ras Lanuf , another major oil terminal 600 km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- east of capital Tripoli . `` Libya 's oil infrastructure has n't been damaged . But the risk of damage is increasing , and that could make it harder for Libya to resume oil supplies any time soon , '' said Carsten Fritsch , analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt . And after thousands of foreign oil workers have fled the country , concerns about oilfield maintenance in the remote interior are also rising . `` There are really two big concerns , '' said Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas . `` Over the course of a shutdown of production to evacuate staff , wells have to be handled very carefully . It 's not like turning a light bulb off and on again . The other concern is that we will see facilities affected by the fighting . '' The Sirte basin holds reservoirs with over 43 billion barrels of oil , which are tapped from both east and west , but it 's at risk of being cleaved down the middle . A trunk pipeline supplies oil flows that end up both in Ras Lanuf , still under Gaddafi 's control , and terminals further east which are run by AGOCO , a unit of the state-run National Oil Company that is now under the control of anti-Gaddafi engineers , Ciszuk said . AGOCO typically ships up to 450,000 bpd . Reports in recent days have shown tankers are still leaving Libya , but it 's not entirely clear who gets the revenue , Gaddafi or rebels . Digging in its heels , AGOCO has said it may start its own marketing division to negotiate with foreign buyers . Gaddafi-aligned oil minister Shokri Ganem , meanwhile , has claimed Libya 's oil sector remains firmly under regime control .

The report , reflecting a three-hour debate in the council last November , included praise for Libya from a range of countries who last Friday agreed that Gaddafi was a gross rights violator and backed his country 's removal from the body . Rights activist groups said the decision by the steering bureau of the council to postpone adoption of the report would avoid embarrassment for Islamic , African and countries like Cuba who had earlier lauded Gaddafi as a democrat . Hillel Neuer of UN Watch said the main effect of the report , compiled after a review of Libya 's record last November , `` was to bolster Gaddafi 's oppressive regime , demoralize his victims and harm the reputation of the U.N. '' U.S. ambassador to the council Eileen Donahoe said the report should not be adopted until `` the voices of the Libyan people , and not just the voice of the Gaddafi regime , can be reflected '' in the final text . Gaddafi struck at rebel control of a key coastal road for a second day on Thursday but received a warning he would be held to account at an international war crimes tribunal in the Hague for suspected crimes by his security forces . Countries who praised Libya during the November session , part of the five-year-old council 's Universal Periodic Review -LRB- UPR -RRB- process of all U.N. member states , included Iran , Algeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , North Korea , Pakistan and Myanmar . But last Friday several of these who are members of the council -- including Pakistan and Algeria -- supported a resolution launching an international inquiry into the ongoing crackdown on protestors and asked the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Libya 's membership in the 47-member Geneva forum . The General Assembly , in which all U.N. member states sit , unanimously agreed to the move on Tuesday -- less than a year after three quarters of countries in the New York body had approved Libya 's accession to the rights council . The UPR process is supposed to provide an objective review of each country 's performance in observing international rights pacts which they have signed and underpin U.N. documents like the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights . But critics say the process has been marked by determination among a majority council bloc of developing countries to ward off serious criticism by heaping praise on their allies -- as they do also in the council itself . Neuer of U.N. Watch , which closely monitors the council , said it should recognize the UPR on Libya was a fraud , withdraw the report and schedule a new session in which council countries `` would tell the truth about the Gaddafi regime 's heinous crimes .

Venezuela said the Libyan leader had agreed to its proposal for an international commission to negotiate an end to the turmoil in the world 's 12th largest oil exporting nation . But Gaddafi 's son Saif al Islam said there was no need for any foreign mediation in the crisis , a leader of the uprising rejected talks with the veteran leader , and the Arab League said cautiously the plan was `` under consideration . '' In Paris , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France and Britain would support the idea of setting up a no-fly zone over Libya if Gaddafi 's forces continued to attack civilians . U.S. President Barack Obama said the United States and the international community must be ready to act rapidly to stop violence against civilians or a humanitarian crisis in Libya . The uprising , the bloodiest yet against a long-serving ruler in the Middle East or North Africa , has torn through the OPEC-member country and knocked out nearly 50 percent of its 1.6 million barrels per day output , the bedrock of its economy . In eastern Libya , witnesses said a warplane bombed Brega the oil terminal town 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , for the second day , part of a struggle for control of a strategically vital coast road and oil industry facilities . Warplanes also launched two raids against the nearby rebel-held town of Ajbadiya , witnesses said . But Juma Amer , Secretary for African Affairs at the Libyan Foreign Ministry , told journalists : `` Media reports that civilian areas were bombed are false . Police had been and are urged to use maximum self restraint . '' Saif said Brega was bombed to scare off militia fighters and to gain control of oil installations . `` First of all the bombs -LRB- were -RRB- just to frighten them to go away , '' he told Britain 's Sky News . On the ground , rebels leading the unprecedented popular revolt pushed their front line west of Brega . They said they had driven back troops loyal to Gaddafi to Ras Lanuf , site of another major oil terminal and 600 km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . They also said they had captured a group of mercenaries . In an angry scene at al-Uqayla , east of Ras Lanuf , a rebel shouted at a captured young African and alleged mercenary : `` You were carrying guns , yes or no ? You were with Gaddafi 's brigades yes or no ? '' The silent youth was shoved onto his knees into the dirt . A man held a pistol close to the boy 's face before a reporter protested and told the man the rebels were not judges . In The Hague , International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Gaddafi and members of his inner circle , could be investigated for alleged crimes committed since the uprising broke out in mid-February . `` We have identified some individuals in the de facto or former authority who have authority over the security forces who allegedly committed the crimes , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . `` They are Muammar Gaddafi , his inner circle including some of his sons , who had this de facto authority . There are also some people with formal authority who should pay attention to crimes committed by their people . '' Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told BBC radio the news from The Hague was `` close to a joke . '' `` No fact-finding mission has been sent to Libya . No diplomats , no ministers , no NGOs or organizations of any type were sent to Libya to check the facts ... No one can be sent to prison based on media reports , '' he said . Ibrahim Mohammad Ali , a spokesman for the public security department , said Libya had told the United Nations it would allow visits by independent human rights observers . Libya is not a signatory of the ICC treaty , `` but we are willing to deal with the ICC and take action against anyone who has acted outside the law , '' he told a Tripoli news conference . A spokesman for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a Gaddafi ally , said the Libyan government had accepted a Venezuelan plan to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict in Libya . Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the plan was under consideration and he was waiting for details from Caracas . Oil prices fell briefly on news of the plan , but traders said the fall was due to profit-taking and they were sceptical about any Venezuelan mediation . Brent crude fell more than $ 3 but by 2000 GMT had recovered to $ 114.82 . Chavez 's plan would involve a commission from Latin America , Europe and the Middle East trying to reach a negotiated outcome between the Libyan leader and rebel forces . An aide to Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebels ' National Libyan Council , told Reuters the rebels were open to talks only on Gaddafi 's resignation or exile to avoid more bloodshed . `` There is nothing else to negotiate , '' he said . He also called for foreign air strikes to set up a `` no-fly zone '' to help the rebels topple Gaddafi . Save The Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres said they were struggling to get medicine and care to Libya 's needy , with gunmen blocking roads and civilians too scared to seek help . The government has tried to persuade people in Tripoli that life continues as normal . But there were queues at banks , and residents said food prices had gone up and the street value of the Libyan dinar had fallen dramatically against the dollar . The official news agency said the Libyan parliament had cut car fuel prices by 25 percent to 0.15 dinars -LRB- $ 0.12 -RRB- a litre . A fish market near Tripoli 's Green Square was mostly empty . `` The situation is affecting us , '' said Ismail , a fisherman . `` All the Egyptian workers who run the boats have left . '' Just outside rebel-held Zawiyah , west of Tripoli , officials took foreign journalists to a local refinery to show it was controlled by the state . Officials said it was running normally . But in the center of Zawiyah , rebels were fully in control and said they had enough forces to repel any government attack . In the opposition stronghold of Benghazi , men of all ages gathered next to the courthouse engaged in fierce debates , enjoying their new-found freedom of speech . `` We must go to Tripoli and get rid of Gaddafi , '' shouted one , to murmurs of approval from those around him . `` But we have only our shirts to protect us from the cannon , '' said Ahmed el Sherif , 60 , standing on the edge of the group . The upheaval is causing a humanitarian crisis , especially on the Tunisian border where tens of thousands of foreign workers have fled to safety . But an organized international airlift started to relieve the human flood from Libya as word spread to refugees that planes were taking them home . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Ca n't they remember what happened when the hard line Shah of Iran was deposed with Western influence . We surely need another Iranian regime in Libya , I do n't think . The Arab countries have to have dictators of one sort or another as they are such an unruly lot . History has proven this over and over . I would like to plead to all sides in the current civil war in Libya : Please , do n't go mindlessly blowing up oil wells like Saddam 's forces did when they retreated from Kuwait 20 years ago . Cap the oil wells , if you must . Cut us Americans off , if you must . Charge whatever you want to charge for a barrel of oil . I realize that middle east nations do n't owe us cheap oil . But I earnestly believe it is wrong for humanity to waste billions of barrels of oil by blowing up oil wells . You remind me of those who like in the US and colonial Africa who always wrote blacks are not capable of doing anything good and relatives of monkeys . Sure only whites know how to start wars ?

The contretemps among the freres Gaddafi over a local bottling plant escalated into a heavily armed confrontation resembling a Hollywood gangster film , as a classified 2006 U.S. cable put it . `` You know the movie ` The Godfather ' ? We 've been living it for the last few months , '' a businessman involved in the dispute was quoted in the cable as telling an official from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tripoli . The cable , which was made available to Reuters by a third party , centers on a bottling plant in Tripoli that was shut down for three months . It had been seized by troops loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , a son of Muammar , who at the time was feuding with one of his brothers , Mohammed . -LRB- Another State Department cable suggests a third Gaddafi son , Saadi -- better known as the family 's professional soccer player -- may also have been involved in the squabble , though no details of his role are given . -RRB- Eventually , the American diplomatic mission in Tripoli , known then as the U.S. Liaison Office , sent a firm protest to the Libyan government . The document states that around the same time , Mohammed Gaddafi , possibly under pressure from his sister Aisha , a family peacemaker , apparently agreed that shares owned by the Libyan Olympic Committee , which he led , would be sold to a third party . Shortly afterward , the cable says , Mutassim 's men left the Coke plant , ending the family standoff , but not before employees of the plant received threats of bodily harm and a Gaddafi cousin was stuffed in the trunk of a car . The Coca-Cola confrontation is among numerous tales about endless squabbling within the Gaddafi clan recounted in State Department cables . Among other things , the incident underlines the difficulties faced by foreign companies operating in Libya even after the U.S. and United Nations began to scale back sanctions following Muammar Gaddafi 's decision in late 2003 to abandon his nuclear weapons program . A spokesman for Coca-Cola acknowledged there had been `` some uncertainty '' surrounding Coke distribution arrangements in Libya during the period described in the cable . But the problem was `` resolved amicably '' by the end of 2006 , the spokesman said , and since then , Coca-Cola had been operating normally in Libya until the onset of the current unrest . A spokesman for the State Department said : `` We will decline to comment on any particular cable . The U.S. has taken aggressive action in recent days to freeze the assets of the Qaddafi family . Thus far , more than $ 30 billion in assets have been blocked . '' WORKERS THREATENED , PLANT MATERIALS DESTROYED Back when Libya was isolated by economic sanctions , its Coca-Cola supply was limited to consignments of the beverage bottled at a plant in Tunisia and transported to Tripoli and Benghazi . After U.S. and international trade embargoes on Libya began to ease , the Tripoli plant was established . It was co-owned by what the cable describes as a British company called Ka'Mur -- whose name was a reference to two embargo-era Libyan soft-drinks -- and by the Libyan Olympic Committee , headed by Mohammed Gaddafi . Immediately after this joint venture was set up , the State Department cable says , the embargo-era Libyan distributor of bottled Coke sued the group behind the newly-opened plant , alleging breach of contract . A complaint was also sent to Coca Cola International alleging that the bottling plant operators had `` stolen the franchise '' from the previous distributors , according to the cable . The bottling plant operators counter-sued . Then , on December 28 , 2005 -- two weeks after the Tripoli plant began turning out locally-bottled batches of Coke -- `` two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility , asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant , '' according to an account of the incident a businessman gave to U.S. diplomats . The U.S. mission in Libya learned from other sources that the troops were loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , who , after the Coca-Cola dispute was resolved , was named Libya 's national security adviser . According to the State Department cable , Mutassim bore a grudge against his brother because he had `` taken over '' the embargo-era domestic soft-drink business in the late 1990s when Mutassim had been exiled to Egypt for `` insubordination '' against their father . -LRB- Another cable says the `` rumor '' was that Mutassim had been linked to a coup attempt . -RRB- Sporadic violent incidents continued to erupt in the weeks after Mutassim 's forces occupied the bottling plant . Early in the siege , a businessman affected by the squabble told American diplomats , the occupation force would allow plant managers to enter the building alone or in pairs . But later employees were barred from the facility . During the weeks that followed , according to the State Department account , anonymous callers threatened three Coca-Cola employees , all Jordanian citizens , with `` political problems '' and bodily harm . Complaints to police , and later to Muammar Gaddafi himself , were met with indifference . The Libyan leader , according to the cable , `` declined to get involved personally '' yet urged plant owners to do `` everything within -LRB- their -RRB- power to resolve the matter according to Libyan law . '' Then , shortly before the plant reopened , Mutassim 's men `` abducted and assaulted '' one of Mohammed Gaddafi 's in-laws to `` send a signal , '' according to the cable . Earlier that day , it reported , one of Mohammed 's associates , after hearing Mutassim `` raging , '' phoned one the bottling plant 's founder to warn him to `` leave the city immediately '' because Mutassim 's men were coming to get him . That night , a posse of Mutassim 's associates turned up outside his brother 's home and began shouting for Mohammed Gaddafi to come outside . When they got no response , the cable reports , Mutassim 's men grabbed `` one of Mohammed 's cousins , '' who they proceeded to stuff into the trunk of one of their cars . The cable does not report the cousin 's ultimate fate . About a month later -- soon after the bottling plant had reopened -- two more violent incidents involving Mutassim Gaddafi occurred , according to the cable . On one occasion , according to a witness who talked to American diplomats , Mutassim personally `` assaulted '' an unnamed cousin of Mohammed Gaddafi -LRB- `` on his mother 's side '' , according to the cable -RRB- who was a member of the Libyan Olympic Committee headed by Mohammed . A day earlier , the cable said , Mutassim had assaulted another of Mohammed 's cousins . -LRB- The cable does not make clear whether either of these cousins might have been the cousin who earlier had been stuffed in a car trunk . -RRB- It was in the wake of these episodes that one of the U.S. diplomatic mission 's contacts offered the comment comparing his situation to `` The Godfather . '' In a `` hushed voice , '' the cable reports , the contact advised his American interlocutor that while he had heard `` stories '' about doing business in Libya , he had `` never imagined '' that what had occurred was still possible . `` ALL PARTIES '' WANTED STORY HUSHED UP After the bottling plant returned to operation , according to the State Department 's account , some contacts of U.S. diplomats said that a settlement between Mohammed and Mutassim Gaddafi had been brokered by their sister Aisha , described in other cables as a frequent arbiter of disputes among her fractious siblings . But other embassy contacts said that Mohammed Gaddafi decided on his own to lessen tensions with Mutassim by selling the Olympic Committee 's shares to a third party . The U.S. mission in Libya claimed some credit for helping to defuse the standoff . The cable says that because the principal company involved in operating the Tripoli bottling plant was not an American entity , U.S. diplomats were limited in what they could do . But in an effort to `` protect the broad interests of a brand representing several million USD in annual sales to a U.S.-based company , '' U.S. diplomats did contact influential Libyan officials to urge that the brotherly dispute be resolved : the U.S. mission sent what the cable describes as a `` strongly worded diplomatic note '' expressing `` serious concern over the plant closure and noting the growing risk of severe damage to U.S. investor confidence in Libya . '' Two days later , the plant reopened . The State Department cable describes the Coca-Cola conflict as a `` case study in the involvement of Qadhafi -LRB- sic -RRB- family members directly influencing the flow , pace and nature of economic activity . Family members squabble over personal financial interest with little regard to the possible impact on foreign investors or international public opinion .

He has never shied from spilling blood , and his end may well prove a bloody affair . Gaddafi has shown this week that he clearly intends to fight on and leading Libyan analysts say regime change will only come if those close to him force him aside . The Libyan leader , experts say , believes so profoundly that he is the embodiment of his country that he is willing to bring Libya down rather than give in a two-week-long revolt against his 41-year autocratic rule . `` There is a real danger that Libya is sliding toward a long , protracted civil war , '' said Fawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics . `` From everything we have seen so far Gaddafi is cornered , his back is to the wall and he has no exit strategy . He will most likely fight to the bitter end , '' he added . On the ground , Gaddafi appeared to have taken the initiative by launching a ground and air attack on rebels in control of the eastern oil terminal town of Brega . Both rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces are arming and positioning themselves for a longer fight and residents and tribes are being armed as well by both sides . `` In the last 48 hours Gaddafi seemed to have absorbed the first shock . He is consolidating his limited power base , '' said Gerges . `` The Gaddafi regime is positioning itself for a prolonged fight . He has adequate military and financial assets to fight . Even though Gaddafi has lost control over large swathes of Libya he seems ready to reduce the country to Somalia-like ruins rather than surrender power , experts say . `` Gaddafi reduced the Libyan people to his persona , '' said Saad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer who was involved in the negotiations over the Lockerbie bombing . `` Gaddafi 's aim will be to create chaos and put the country through civil war or Somalisation -- no central power , a divided country in which he will remain a force , '' said Djebbar . `` Gaddafi has containers of dollars , he has guns to arm people and he has loyalists , the more chaos he creates the better -LRB- for him -RRB- , '' Djebbar added . `` His message is : apres moi le deluge . You force me out of power and I will leave either a divided country or a country in civil war like Somalia . '' The uprising , the bloodiest yet against despotic rulers in the region , was sparked by the arrest of a human rights lawyer in Benghazi on February 14 . Revolt quickly spread , with Libyans from all walks of life -- professionals , academics , tribesmen , former soldiers and students -- demanding an end to Gaddafi 's repressive rule . Libyans have not experience democracy since he ousted King Idris and created a police state in 1969 . The mercurial leader has managed to cling to power through a carefully constructed security apparatus . The press remains gagged , despite a slight easing of curbs in recent years , freedom of speech is unheard of and political parties are illegal . But 41 years of repression have brought simmering discontent to the boil . Added to that , for many Libyans and world leaders , the former army officer is the evil hand behind terrorism inside and outside his country . Gaddafi has spent much of Libya 's oil cash financing terrorists responsible for hijacks and killings and groups seeking to kill dissidents and destabilize pro-Western governments in Africa . The Libyan upheaval has not only proven to be bloodier and costlier but more protracted than Tunis and Egypt , raising the risks of ethnic war that could fragment the country , trigger a humanitarian crisis and further jeopardize oil supplies . In Egypt and Tunisia , powerful military elites ultimately decided the outcome of the revolutions , easing unpopular leaders Hosni Mubarak and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali from office . But in Libya it is more opaque and complex tribal power structures could decide how events play out . Having risen through the military himself , Gaddafi emasculated the army to prevent its commanders from threatening him following periodic failed coup attempts . `` He knows from his own experience that coup d'etats come from the army so he closed the way for any potential coup d'etat a long time ago . He dismantled the army and set up instead what he called the popular army , '' said Djebbar . He created well-armed and tightly knit brigades led by his own al-Gaddadfa tribe and by al-Magarha , another tribe headed by Abdullah Sanussi , Gaddafi 's brother-in-law and chief enforcer . Experts agree that part of the explanation for Gaddafi 's survival is linked to having his sons in charge of his security and his own tribe occupying the most important positions . `` His units are die-hard loyalists , based on skin and kin , blood ties which for Gaddafi are more important than ideology . He has his son Khamis who is in charge of a special army unit , '' Djebbar said . Those familiar with Gaddafi say he is the only decision-maker , a man with absolute authority who does not delegate power to anybody , not even to his own sons . On the ground , the balance of power looks equal . Gaddafi and his forces control the capital Tripoli and some nearby towns as well as his birthplace Sirte further east , the site of large arsenals and bases designed to guard oil infrastructure . The rebels hold Benghazi , Misrata and Zawiyah and Jebel Nafusa southwest of Tripoli . `` Gaddafi has not given up , the attack he launched on Brega is an indication that he intends to carry on , '' said George Joffe , a Middle East expert at Cambridge University . Despite the defection of large numbers of tribes some still support him including his own Gaddadfa community . `` The forces on the ground might be quite well balanced . It really can go on for quite some time . If you control Benghazi you control -LRB- the eastern region of -RRB- Cyrenaica , '' said Joffe . `` If you control Tripoli you control Tripolitania . In those circumstances you could have two forces relatively well balanced who can confront each other for a long time . '' On the table is a peace plan devised by from Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez , according to Secretary-General Amr Moussa . Venezuela says Gaddafi has accepted it , but there has been no confirmation . Rebels have said they would not negotiate with Gaddafi , and their reaction to the plan is not known . One scenario for a peaceful exit is to have some sort of tribal deal . This might see a combination of the sons of Gaddafi , his daughter and Sanussi push him aside and allow the Gaddadfa tribe and al-Magarha , former officers and dignitaries to enter into talks with tribes in the east to grant Gaddafi safe passage to retire in his hometown of Sirte . They in turn could make commitments to guarantee the security of the family . The other option is for him to go abroad with immunity from prosecution . But this option may not be possible after the International Criminal Court said Gaddafi and members of his inner circle could be investigated for alleged crimes committed against civilians by security forces . Joffe said he suspected Gaddafi would eventually be overthrown in a palace coup . `` The way it will come to an end is if his domestic support ends from his family , tribes , his own battalion or army unit -- if they remove their support he is finished ...

Information Minister Andres Izarra also confirmed the Arab League had shown interest in the Chavez plan to send an international commission to talk with both sides in Libya . Revolts in Libya and elsewhere in the Arab world are politically awkward for Chavez due to his friendships in the region . But his relationship with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has been particularly warm with the pair showering each other with gifts and awards .

A citation with the award praised the Venezuelan leader 's `` brave heart , intelligent mind , eloquent oratory and firm hand . '' \\* Chavez first visited Tripoli a year after taking office in 1999 and has returned five times . \\* In 2006 , Libya named a new 11,000-seat soccer stadium after Chavez near the Mediterranean city of Benghazi . The Libyan soccer federation said Chavez was being honored for his `` brave humanitarian positions , especially in support of the people of Gaza in the recent Israeli aggression . '' \\* Making a rare visit to the Americas , Gaddafi attended a Chavez-hosted summit of Latin American and African leaders in 2009 . Together , they called for a new world order countering Western economic dominance . \\* After the meeting on Venezuela 's Caribbean resort island of Margarita , Chavez presented Gaddafi with a replica of a sword of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar . \\* Last year , Chavez said he planned to govern from a Bedouin-style tent given to him by Gaddafi , to make space for homeless Venezuelans he invited to live at his palace . \\* At the height of recent protests in Egypt , Chavez said he had spoken to Gaddafi and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for briefings on the situation . \\* When the demonstrations and violence reached Tripoli , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he had seen information suggesting Gaddafi had fled and was on his way to Venezuela .

The fighting appeared to confirm the division of the vast desert oil-producing state between a western area round the capital Tripoli held by forces loyal to Gaddafi and an eastern region held by those rebelling against his four-decade rule . In Zawiyah , a town 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli whose control by the rebels had embarrassed the government , `` dozens were killed and more were wounded , '' by pro-Gaddafi forces , said Mohamed , a resident . `` We have counted 30 dead civilians . '' The loyalist forces used grenade-launchers , heavy machineguns and snipers on the roof of a new hotel to fire at protesters when they marched after Friday prayers to demand the fall of the regime , Mohamed said . An improvised rebel force had withdrawn to the central Martyrs Square , and government troops were 4-5 kilometres away , a rebel spokesman said . A Libyan government official said of the town : `` It 's been liberated , maybe there are still some pockets -LRB- under rebel control -RRB- but otherwise it 's been liberated . '' In the east , rebels said their forces had taken the oil town of Ras Lanuf , which lies on a strategic coastal road , hours after saying they had captured the town 's airport . Rebels have already seized control of much of the rest of eastern Libya , the main oil-producing part of the country , in a popular uprising centred on Benghazi , Libya 's second city . A rebel spokesman said pro-Gaddafi forces bombed an arms depot -- one of the biggest weapons depots in the region -- on the outskirts of Benghazi on Friday . `` A lot of people have been killed . There are many people in the hospital . No one can approach , it 's still very dangerous , '' said a resident who would only identify himself as Saleh . Security forces had cordoned off the area , and a Reuters witness said at least eight ambulances were seen ferrying casualties from the scene . Windows were shattered in suburbs several kilometres from the scene , residents said . The uprising against Gaddafi is the bloodiest yet against a long-serving ruler in the Arab world , and follows the ousting in the past weeks of the long-time presidents of both Tunisia and Egypt -- Libya 's western and eastern neighbors . The cut in Libya 's 1.6 million barrel per day oil output -- caused partly by the flight of thousands of key foreign oil workers -- is a major blow to its economy . News of the fighting pushed up U.S. crude prices to their highest levels since September 2008 , and Brent crude futures for April delivery LCOc1 rose $ 1.36 to $ 116.17 a barrel . The International Energy Agency said one million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libya 's oil output was shut , the top of the range it had estimated on Wednesday . -LRB- ID : nWEB3662 -RRB- The upheaval has caused a humanitarian emergency on the Tunisian border where tens of thousands of foreign workers have fled to safety . An international airlift is under way , reducing the number of refugees stranded in tented camps . The rebels earlier told Reuters they were open to talks only about Gaddafi 's exile or resignation , following attacks on civilians that have provoked international condemnation , arms and economic sanctions and a war crimes probe . `` Victory or death ... We will not stop until we liberate all this country , '' Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebel National Libyan Council told supporters of the two-week-old uprising . Western nations have called on Gaddafi to go and are considering various options including the imposition of a no-fly zone , but are wary about any offensive military involvement . In Tripoli , shooting rang out across Tajoura district as Gaddafi loyalists broke up a crowd of protesters seeking an end to his long rule and shouting `` Gaddafi is the enemy of God ! '' The demonstrators spilled out of the Murat Adha mosque after Friday prayers , and several hundred began chanting for an end to Gaddafi 's four decades in power . Up to 100 people in Tripoli had been arrested , accused of helping the rebels , Al Jazeera said . Earlier on Friday , rebel volunteers said a rocket attack by a government warplane just missed a rebel-held military base which houses an arsenal in the eastern town of Ajdabiyah . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Some Libyan bloggers are wondering if the Central banks will be able to cover withdrawals by citizens now that Libyan overseas assets have been frozen . And this question is on the minds of many who are more concerned about the humanitarian crisis developing there rather than the eventual political outcome , oil prices or power play . Can someone enlighten this uninformed reader ? I am appalled at the lack of action by the West . Is it not possible to at least provide shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles , and other weapons .

Full Article Gaddafi launches counter-offensive on Libya rebels TRIPOLI | Sun Mar 6 , 2011 11:56 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched counter-offensives against rebel-held towns on Sunday , increasing fears that Libya is heading for a protracted civil war rather than the swift revolutions seen in Tunisia and Egypt . The Gaddafi government proclaimed sweeping overnight victories over what it called terrorist bands . But after what residents said was a day of fierce fighting with artillery , rockets and mortar bombs , rebel forces announced they had fought off Gaddafi 's forces in the towns of Zawiyah and Misrata to the immediate west and to the east of Tripoli . `` We would like to put the people of this great nation at ease ... because the regime is spreading rumors , '' opposition rebel council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told a Benghazi news conference . `` Both Zawya and Misrata are secured , liberated cities . '' Gaddafi 's troops , backed by tanks , artillery , warplanes and helicopters also attacked positions near the oil port of Ras Lanuf , 660 km -LRB- 410 miles -RRB- east of the capital . Misrata , with a population of 300,000 , is the largest town controlled by rebels outside the rebel-held east of the country . If rebel soldiers were able to continue their fitful advance westwards , Misrata could be a stepping stone to reaching the capital , Gaddafi 's principal stronghold . Loyalists had poured into the streets of Tripoli at dawn on Sunday firing into the air and holding portraits of the leader who has headed the OPEC oil and gas producer for 41 years . `` These are celebrations because government forces have taken control of all areas to Benghazi and are in the process of taking control of Benghazi , '' spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said , referring to Libya 's second city , situated in the far east . But the celebrations appeared to be premature as Benghazi remained firmly under rebel control and insurgents at Zawiyah and Misrata said they had repulsed assaults and were now fighting to take back the town of Bin Jawad , west of Ras Lanuf . Government troops pushed the insurgents out of Bin Jawad which they had captured on Saturday . But the rebels regrouped around Ras Lanuf and moved back to the outskirts of Bin Jawad , a small , dusty town sandwiched between the coastal highway and the Mediterranean Sea , 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte . One fighter returning wounded to Ras Lanuf from the government assault on Bin Jawad was asked what he had seen . `` Death , '' he replied , too distraught to say any more . Rebels surrounded by troops near the center of Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , faced another attack after repelling two assaults by tanks and infantry the day before . `` This morning , there was a new attack , bigger than yesterday . There were one and a half hours of fighting ... Two people were killed from our side and many more injured , '' spokesman Youssef Shagan said by telephone . `` We are still in full control of the square , '' he added . Elite brigades under Gaddafi 's son Khamis also launched an assault on Misrata , 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- east of the capital . `` The brigades tried to reach the center of the town but revolutionaries managed to repel them . They retreated to the airbase , '' said a resident who declined to be named . `` The revolutionaries captured 20 soldiers and seized a tank . The town is now fully in the control of the youths , '' he said . At least 18 people , including a baby , were killed in the fighting in Misrata on Sunday , a doctor told Reuters by phone . `` We have 18 martyrs but the figure is not final . We also have many people wounded , I can not even count them , '' said the doctor , who works at Misrata main hospital , adding that the dead included rebels and civilians . Rebels first took Bin Jawad on Saturday , but later withdrew . Army units then occupied local homes and set up sniper and rocket-propelled grenade positions for an ambush . `` It 's real fierce fighting , like Vietnam , '' rebel fighter Ali Othman told Reuters . `` Every kind of weapon is being used . We 've retreated from an ambush and we are going to regroup . '' When the rebels returned , a fierce exchange of rockets and mortar bombs ensued just outside Bin Jawad with the army also using heavy artillery . Behind rebel lines , hundreds of fighters armed with machine guns and assault rifles waited to advance . `` The firing is sustained , there is the thud of shells landing , the whoosh of rockets , puffs of smoke and heavy machine gun fire in the distance , '' a Reuters correspondent there said . The rebels said they had shot down a helicopter on Sunday and Reuters was shown the wreckage of a warplane on Saturday near Ras Lanuf that rebels said they had brought down . Doctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting . A French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive . Britain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi have now left Libya . The Sunday Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB- SAS -RRB- unit had been captured after a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired . `` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces . They could not ascertain if they were friends or foes . For our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said . Western leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces . German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi . `` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . `` The flow of money must be cut off . '' The International Energy Agency said the revolt had blocked about 60 percent of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd oil output . The drop , due largely to the flight of thousands of foreign oil workers , will batter the economy and have already jacked up crude prices abroad .

In an interview with Al Arabiya television , Saadi Gaddafi also said the Libyan leader could not resign as demanded by the rebels because that could also lead to civil war . Saadi blamed some of the unrest on one of his brothers , Saif al-Islam , who he said had sought economic reforms but failed to address the problems of ordinary Libyans . `` The tribes are all armed , there are forces from the Libyan army and the eastern region is armed . The situation is not like Tunisia or Egypt , '' said Saadi , who was briefly a professional footballer in Italy before turning to business . Protests in Tunisia and Egypt have toppled the presidents of both countries since the start of the year . `` The situation is very dangerous , '' he said . The leader must play a very , very big role in calming Libya and convincing people to sit together . `` If something happened to the leader , who would be in control ? A civil war would start . '' He said the Libyan army had so far only intervened to protect `` sensitive sites '' and a wider war would result if his father ordered them into an all-out fight . `` The leader has given special instructions to the army not to intervene , save for the protection of sensitive sites , and to be ready to repel foreign intervention . '' The military was just waiting for Gaddafi 's orders , Saadi said . `` So far it has not moved . When it does , a civil war may erupt , '' he said in the full broadcast of the interview , which Al Arabiya had excerpted earlier in the day . The news channel said that Saadi Gaddafi warned that Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that tribes would fight against each other . He said Tripoli was holding a dialogue through the tribes to answer the demands of the people , without making clear which demands he was referring to . `` But there are armed groups that pursue the path of killing and violence , which I think leaves only the choice of confronting them , '' he added . Saadi 's criticism of his brother Saif al-Islam hinted at strains within the Gaddafi family as the unrest continued . `` The leader told them -LRB- Saif al-Islam and the ministers -RRB- on a daily basis that you are facilitating matters and the budget , but there are things they did not do . '' Those shortcomings included failing to address issues like prices of basic commodities that concerned Libyans , Saadi said . The reforming efforts of Saif al-Islam were stymied by opposition from inside the ruling elite and , some analysts had said , family members . Educated at a British university , Saif al-Islam has acted a spokesman for his father during the unrest . Saadi had a brief career in Italy 's Serie A soccer league between 2003 and 2007 , though he had little time on the field . Saadi , who qualified as an engineer and also holds military rank , later turned to business . He told Reuters in an interview last year he was behind a project to set up a free trade zone on the Mediterranean coast west of Tripoli . When violence engulfed Libya 's eastern city of Benghazi in mid-February , Saadi spoke on local radio to say he had been appointed commandant of the city .

Rumors that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was seeking a deal with rebels caused oil to erase some gains . But U.S. crude prices remained more than 1 percent higher , trading around $ 105 a barrel . The increase in the price of oil weighed on both European and U.S. stocks , with technology shares on Wall Street also hit by a downgrade on the semiconductor industry by Wells Fargo . The euro fell against the dollar after having earlier hit a four-month high as expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month faded . U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 jumped to as high as $ 106.95 per barrel , the highest level since September 2008 , as Gaddafi 's counter-offensive against rebels deepened concerns that Africa 's largest holder of oil reserves is headed for civil war . Prices were still 1.08 percent higher at $ 105.55 after rumors that the Libyan leader was trying to secure a safe exit from the country merely curbed initial gains . `` The major risk remains the prospect of the political unrest spreading to the Gulf-producing region , '' said Caroline Bain , economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit . `` However , even if there is civil unrest in Saudi Arabia , it is not a given that oil production will be affected . '' The prospects of further unrest in oil-rich Middle Eastern countries drove investors to seek safe-haven assets .

Troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched counter-offensives against rebel-held towns on Sunday , increasing fears that Libya is heading for a civil war rather than the swift revolutions seen in Tunisia and Egypt , sending U.S. crude to its strongest in more than two years . Spot gold added $ 2.50 an ounce to $ 1,434.45 an ounce by 0209 GMT , within sight of a record high struck last week of $ 1,440.10 -- the level which has become a key resistance . `` If we do see tension escalating further , then we could witness a new high in gold . Besides Libya , I think investors will also be looking at other countries within the Middle East . The example will be Saudi Arabia , '' said Ong Yi Ling , investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore . Saudi Arabia 's council of senior clerics issued a statement on Sunday forbidding public protests , which the rulers of the U.S. ally and key oil exporter fear could spread following demonstrations by minority Shi'ites . The kingdom has escaped major protests like those which toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia , but the wave of unrest has reached its neighbors Yemen , Bahrain , Jordan and Oman . `` With gold prices moving up , silver will be poised for leverage gains . I think a little bit of economic optimism will be boosting silver . In a short-term , I would say that silver may outperform gold , '' said Ong . Silver was steady after rising as high as $ 36.14 an ounce , partly driven by data showing a rebound in U.S. jobs and some physical buying by China . The closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed an increase of 192,000 jobs as private employers hired 222,000 workers , the most since April . That took the jobless rate down to a nearly two-year low of 8.9 percent . U.S. gold futures for April rose $ 5.7 an ounce to $ 1,434.3 an ounce . Gold should push higher from its near-record levels due to its appeal as a safe haven , while iron ore should regain its upward momentum on the back of red-hot industrial demand from Asia , forecasters told the world 's largest mining conference on Sunday . In Japan , the Japanese retail price for gold rose to a 28-year high above 4,000 yen -LRB- $ 48.60 -RRB- per gram on Monday as the dollar gold market neared its lifetime peak . The physical market was muted , but dealers expected demand from top consumer India to pick up during the wedding season . `` We are seeing a two-way business here , but it 's hard to single out any particular country . The same goes to silver . There 's good silver buying from China , '' said a physical dealer in Singapore . The high-demand wedding season is underway in India , but jewellers are likely waiting to see if prices decline , Ong said . Jewellery is the most common gift during religious events and weddings in India . `` I would think with prices so high , then the physical side would n't be so strong . They will be waiting for prices , perhaps , to come down to about $ 1,400 level before they buy on dips , '' said Ong of Phillip Futures . In other markets , the dollar struggled against a basket of major currencies early in Asia on Monday after failing to get a boost from the non-farm data , while the euro stayed supported on expectations of an interest rate hike next month . The Nikkei slipped 1.2 percent on Monday , handing back most of last week 's gains , as fears of more turmoil in the Middle East and higher oil prices overshadowed solid U.S. payroll data . -LRB- Reporting by Lewa Pardomuan ; Editing by Ed Lane -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "201", "dct": "2011-03-07", "dates": ["2011-03-07", "2011-03-07", "2011-03-06", "2011-03-07", "2011-03-07", "2011-03-06", "2011-03-07", "2011-03-06", "2011-03-06", "2011-03-06", "2011-03-06", "2011-03-06"], "text": "TRIPOLI | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 4:49 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched counter-offensives against rebel-held towns on Sunday , increasing fears that Libya is heading for a civil war rather than the swift revolutions seen in Tunisia and Egypt . The Gaddafi government proclaimed sweeping overnight victories over what it called terrorist bands . But after what residents said was a day of fierce fighting with artillery , rockets and mortar bombs , rebel forces announced they had fought off Gaddafi 's forces in the towns of Zawiyah , to the immediate west of Tripoli , and Misrata to the east . `` Today Misrata witnessed the toughest battle since the beginning of the revolution . Horrible attacks , '' one resident , who did not want to give his name , told Reuters by phone . `` They came from three sides and managed to enter the town from the west and south but when they reached the center of Misrata the rebels pushed them back , '' he said . Misrata , with a population of 300,000 , is the largest town controlled by rebels outside the rebel-held east of the country . If rebel soldiers were able to continue their fitful advance westwards , Misrata could be a stepping stone to reaching the capital , Gaddafi 's principal stronghold . Rebel council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told a Benghazi news conference : `` We would like to put the people of this great nation at ease ... because the regime is spreading rumors . `` Both Zawiyah and Misrata are secured , liberated cities . '' Gaddafi 's troops , backed by tanks , artillery , warplanes and helicopters attacked positions near the oil port of Ras Lanuf , 660 km -LRB- 410 miles -RRB- east of the capital . Rebels were forced to retreat from Bin Jawad which is on the road to Sirte , the hometown of Gaddafi who has ruled the OPEC oil and gas producer for 41 years . `` Gaddafi 's cut us to pieces . He 's firing on us with tanks and missiles . I do n't know what we 're going to do now , '' Momen Mohammed told Reuters . One fighter returning wounded to Ras Lanuf from Bin Jawad was asked what he had seen . `` Death , '' he replied , too distraught to say any more . Rebels said they planned another attack on Bin Jawad , which is only 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- from Sirte , on Monday morning . Rebel commanders told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces were reinforcing Sirte where they had more than 20,000 fighters . They said the city houses the Saadi -LRB- a son of Gaddafi -RRB- battalion which includes four brigades , as well as armed tribe members . Loyalists had poured into the streets of Tripoli at dawn on Sunday firing into the air and holding portraits of Gaddafi . `` These are celebrations because government forces have taken control of all areas to Benghazi and are in the process of taking control of Benghazi , '' spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said , referring to Libya 's second city , situated in the far east . But the celebrations appeared to be premature as Benghazi remained firmly under rebel control while insurgents stood their ground at Zawiyah and Misrata . Rebels surrounded by troops near the center of Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , faced another attack after repelling two assaults by tanks and infantry the day before . `` This morning , there was a new attack , bigger than yesterday . There were one and a half hours of fighting ... Two people were killed from our side and many more injured , '' spokesman Youssef Shagan said by telephone . Elite brigades under Gaddafi 's son Khamis also launched an assault on Misrata , 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- east of the capital . `` The brigades tried to reach the center of the town but revolutionaries managed to repel them . They retreated to the airbase , '' said a resident who declined to be named . `` The revolutionaries captured 20 soldiers and seized a tank . The town is now fully in the control of the youths , '' he said . At least 18 people , including a baby , were killed in the fighting in Misrata on Sunday , a doctor told Reuters by phone . `` We have 18 martyrs but the figure is not final . We also have many people wounded , I can not even count them , '' said the doctor , who works at Misrata main hospital , adding that the dead included rebels and civilians . Doctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting . A French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive . Britain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi had now left Libya . The Sunday Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB- SAS -RRB- unit had been captured during a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired . `` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces . They could not ascertain if they were friends or foes . For our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said earlier . Western leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces . German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi . `` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . `` The flow of money must be cut off . '' The International Energy Agency said the revolt had blocked about 60 percent of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd oil output . The drop , due largely to the flight of thousands of foreign oil workers , will batter the economy and have already jacked up crude prices abroad .

Rumours that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was seeking a deal with rebels caused oil to erase some gains . But U.S. crude prices remained more than 1 percent higher , trading around $ 105 a barrel . The increase in the price of oil weighed on both European and U.S. stocks , with technology shares on Wall Street also hit by a downgrade on the semiconductor industry by Wells Fargo . The euro fell against the dollar after having earlier hit a four-month high as expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month faded . U.S. crude oil futures jumped to as high as $ 106.95 per barrel , the highest level since September 2008 , as Gaddafi 's counter-offensive against rebels deepened concerns that Africa 's largest holder of oil reserves is headed for civil war . Prices were still 1.08 percent higher at $ 105.55 after rumors that the Libyan leader was trying to secure a safe exit from the country merely curbed initial gains . `` The major risk remains the prospect of the political unrest spreading to the Gulf-producing region , '' said Caroline Bain , economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit . `` However , even if there is civil unrest in Saudi Arabia , it is not a given that oil production will be affected .

But Rome is moving cautiously , realizing it has the most to lose among European nations as events unfold in the North African nation just 300 miles from Italy 's southernmost island . Six months ago Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and other officials fawned over Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , treating him like royalty on his third visit to Italy in two years . Now , a 2008 `` friendship treaty '' that prohibited Italian bases from being used in any military action against Libya has been officially `` suspended '' while Italy seems to be grabbing at straws over what policy to take with Libya . The numbers tell the story . Italy imports about 80 percent of its energy needs . About 32 percent of Libya 's oil output goes to Italy -- making up about 25 percent of Italy 's imports -- and about 12 percent of Italy 's gas comes from Libya . Under the friendship treaty , Italy promised to pay Libya $ 5 billion in compensation over 25 years for colonial misdeeds . Libya has been spending petrodollars on stakes in Italian companies while Italian firms have won infrastructure and energy contracts in the country it ruled as a colony from 1911 to 1943 . The web of commercial interests includes banking , textiles , cars , construction , railways , aerospace -- and soccer clubs . Rome was de facto guarantor of Tripoli 's good behavior when Libya was warily welcomed back into the international community after renouncing terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . While leaders such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton dutifully went to Tripoli and appeared uneasy with Gaddafi , Italy pulled out all the stops and Berlusconi embraced him as `` my great friend . '' Gian Antonio Stella , a commentator for the Corriere della Sera newspaper , argued that Italy has to feel more responsible for a positive outcome to the Libyan crisis because Rome `` revered and adulated '' Gaddafi until only a short while ago . When the Libyan unrest broke out Berlusconi seemed almost in denial , perhaps sensing that his one-on-one style of diplomatic relations had fallen flat , as Gaddafi returned to his old habit of insulting the former colonial power . `` In Gaddafi 's case this -LRB- Berlusconi 's personal style produced results that were grotesque and undignified , '' wrote political commentator and former ambassador Sergio Romano . `` We had to put up with the capriciousness of the colonel , his delays -LRB- in 2009 he failed to show up to address parliament -RRB- his insults , his uniforms , his tents in our parks , '' Romano said . Rome 's behavior can have far-reaching effects for Italy . `` Political imprudence by the government can risk unleashing resentment from whatever Libya emerges from the current crisis , '' said Aliboni of the Institute for International Affairs . `` National interests would be gravely put at risk . '' It is no surprise that Italy is no cheerleader for sanctions against Libya or of calls for the freezing of its assets or the imposition of a no-fly zone . Rome has made clear that it is not considering unilaterally freezing Libyan holdings in Italian companies at present . Libya owns stakes in blue-chip Italian companies including bank UniCredit and defense company Finmeccanica , and the fate of its holdings have been under scrutiny since the European Union imposed sanctions on Libya . The EU agreed last week to freeze the assets of Gaddafi and a list of senior Libyan officials after Libyan security forces used violence to crack down on protesters . But since that list does not mention the country 's sovereign wealth fund , the Libyan Investment Authority -LRB- LIA -RRB- , or the Libyan central bank -- entities that hold stakes in Italian companies -- Italy does not plan to freeze the holdings , a source familiar with the matter told Reuters . The question is where do the assets of Gaddafi and his family end and where do Libya 's assets begin . `` The problem is that in an authoritarian regime today , just like in the absolute monarchies of the medieval times , it is hard to distinguish between the personal goods of the sovereign and those of the state , '' said commentator Stefano Lepri in La Stampa newspaper . Other European countries have been more aggressive in their pursuit of assets linked to Gaddafi and his top aides . British publisher Pearson Plc last week said the LIA 's 3.2 percent stake in the company had been frozen because of the sanctions , while Austria has widened an asset freeze list to include a top official at the LIA . Also making Italy 's position with Libya difficult is the prospect of a wave of illegal immigration , worse than the one that hit it in the early 1990s after the collapse of communism in Albania . `` The contrast between the moral imperative -LRB- to support democracy -RRB- and the political dividend is particularly stark because of the fear of the consequences the fall of Gaddafi 's regime could have on migration , '' said Emanuela Paoletti of the International Migration Institute at Oxford University . In 2009 , Rome and Tripoli signed a deal allowing Italy 's coastguard to return boatloads of illegal immigrants to Libya Before then , Libya was a main staging post for illegal immigration from Africa and Gaddafi has made it clear that he could let the genie out of the bottle again if he wanted . He told France 's Journal du Dimanche on Sunday that if he fell `` you will have immigration , thousands of people from Libya will invade Europe . There will be no one to stop them any more .

Though facing a vastly superior armory of tanks , artillery and aircraft , the rebels are largely standing their ground , controlling vast swathes of the east . Following are some scenarios for how the conflict could develop , and the clues that could indicate which one of them is most likely to become a reality : This is now looking like the most probable scenario , at least for the time being . Stalemate would in effect produce a divided country and raise complex questions for the outside world in its trade and political relations with the oil producer . `` Neither side in the Libyan conflict currently appears strong enough to defeat the other in the short term , '' said think tank IHS Global Insight . `` This prospect of military stalemate has raised the prospect of a protracted civil war . '' -- The ground-based fighting so far has been in a stretch of desert along the Mediterranean coast . The front line can move back and forth in this area without giving either side a significant military advantage , because there are no major population centers or bases in the area . The stretch is bookended by two important locations : Ajdabiyah in the east , gateway to the rebels ' eastern strongholds , and in the west Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte . If the fighting stays between these two locations , it amounts to stalemate . -- Foot-dragging among major Western powers about military intervention . Foreign military help could tip the balance in favor of the rebels . Many Libya-watchers see this as the most likely outcome in the long-term , based on the calculation that Gaddafi 's forces have spilled too much blood in the last few weeks to retain legitimacy . The question is , how quickly could such a victory come ? -- Can the rebels organize an effective military hierarchy ? So far , the forces have shown more zeal than military skill . The rebels ' National Libyan Council named Omar Hariri , one of the officers who took part in Gaddafi 's 1969 coup , as head of the military . But it is not clear how much authority he would have . Evidence on the ground that fighters are wearing standard uniforms , have received training , are operating as units , and have radios to pass orders down the chain of command , would be the clearest signs that they are getting organized . -- Will the rebels in Misrata hold out ? This city is the biggest population center still defying Gaddafi 's control outside the eastern regions . Troops from the 32nd Brigade , commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis and reputed to be the best forces in Libya , have so far failed to capture it . This is telling about the quality of Gaddafi 's forces . If they can not take an isolated city defended by armed civilians , they must have serious shortcomings . -- Outside military intervention . If Western powers remain wary of intervening openly , then more discreet assistance -- sending in weapons or military advisers -- could also tip the scales toward the rebels . -- Can the rebels take Sirte ? If they can , they will score the psychological victory of seizing Gaddafi 's hometown , and also control a major air base . '' -LRB- Sirte -RRB- controls the coast approach to Tripoli from the east and to the key nearby cities of Misrata and Zawiyah , which are the doorway to the Tripoli region , '' said Saad Djebbar , an Algerian lawyer and expert on Libya . This is the least likely scenario , mainly because the rebels control a huge chunk of territory and seem very well entrenched there . `` Gaddafi has lost the east , '' said Djebbar , who advised Tripoli when two Libyans were tried for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing . But Gaddafi is a proven survivor who has held on to power for more than four decades , so it is impossible to count him out . He has around him a coterie of political and military supporters who have much to lose if the regime collapses . The conflict could conceivably be decided in Tripoli , rather than the small towns on the coast , if senior military commanders or Gaddafi supporters decided the conflict could not be won . -- The eastern rebellion collapses under the weight of its own internal divisions and military weakness . This may be the only real opportunity for Gaddafi to make a comeback . `` In the east , the opposition are holding but they need to be careful that they do n't collapse completely , '' said David Hartwell , Middle East analyst with IHS Global Insight . -- Could the rebels hold together and hold the country together ? All opposition in Libya has been stifled over forty years of Gaddafi rule and there are no organized civic groups to provide a ready basis for government . One of Muammar Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said Libya would descend into civil war if his father stepped down . He said Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that the country 's tribes would fight against each other . The focus of events could switch from the smaller towns of the Mediterranean coast .

WASHINGTON | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 5:49 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The White House pushed back on Monday against rising pressure from some lawmakers for direct intervention in Libya , saying it first wanted to figure out what various military options could achieve . `` It would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . `` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing . '' Officials cautioned that a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya , an idea popular among Democratic and Republican lawmakers , would be difficult to enforce and might not stop helicopter gunships from attacking rebels fighting to end Muammar Gaddafi 's four-decade rule . The Obama administration has faced sharp criticism , especially from Republicans and conservative commentators , for being too cautious over the turmoil in Libya but has signaled it will not be rushed into hasty decisions that could suck the U.S. military into a new war and fuel anti-American sentiment . One major obstacle : U.S. officials are still trying to identify the main actors within the opposition fighting to oust Gaddafi . The aims of these groups are unclear and it is not even certain they view the United States favorably . Carney said the United States was trying to `` reach out '' to Gaddafi opponents through diplomats , business people and non-governmental groups . He also had a fresh warning to Gaddafi 's close associates , saying U.S. intelligence agencies were seeking to identify those involved in the violence which has forced tens of thousands of people to flee the country . President Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals that we 've seen there . '' But Kori Schake , an associate professor at West Point military academy , was critical of Obama 's statement , saying it followed a `` pattern of broad pronouncements without practical follow-through . '' The White House has long said all options are on the table over Libya but , for the first time on Monday , it gave a vague priority to the possible military steps being studied . Bottom of the list is sending in ground troops , Carney told a briefing . Enforcing a no-fly zone was a `` serious '' option , he said , as was a U.N. arms embargo and humanitarian assistance . Arming the rebels was also a possibility , he added . But State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley appeared to contradict Carney when he noted that a February 26 U.N. Security Council resolution barred all weapons transfers to Libya . Crowley also denied a British newspaper report that Washington had asked Saudi Arabia to supply weapons to rebels . Military analysts say the rebels do not appear to be short of weapons and the United States would be wary of providing arms that could end up in the wrong hands and be used against U.S. forces elsewhere . Brian Katulis , a Middle East expert who has informally advised the White House on the turmoil sweeping the region , said the Obama administration was constrained by its reluctance to act militarily without international support . Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated on Monday that any intervention in Libya would require broad backing . Underscoring the lack of consensus , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow opposed military intervention . China , a fellow veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council , has expressed similar misgivings . The United States has deployed two amphibious assault ships off the Libyan coast , ostensibly to help with any humanitarian emergencies , while dispatching military transport aircraft to airlift stranded Egyptian refugees from neighboring Tunisia . Over the weekend , leading Republican and Democratic senators urged Obama to do more to help Libya 's rebels , who have fought Gaddafi 's security forces to a standstill in some areas but are all but powerless to stop repeated air strikes . Mitch McConnell , the top Republican in the Senate , said one option was `` simply aiding and arming the insurgents , '' noting that the United States often did this during the Cold War . John Kerry , the influential Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is close to Obama , repeated his call for a no-fly zone and floated another idea -- bombing Libyan runways to ground Gaddafi 's warplanes .

Al Jazeera television said rebels had rejected an offer by Gaddafi to hold a meeting of parliament to work out a deal under which he would step down . With civilians surrounded by forces loyal to Gaddafi in two western towns , Misrata and Zawiyah , fears grew of a rising humanitarian crisis if the fighting continued . U.N. aid coordinator Valerie Amos said more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian aid . `` Humanitarian organizations need urgent access now , '' she said . `` People are injured and dying and need help immediately . '' The U.N. appealed for $ 160 million to fund an operation over the next three months to get shelter , food and medicines ready . `` We are working closely with partners on a contingency basis on elements of a resolution on a no-fly zone , making clear the need for regional support , a clear trigger for such a resolution and an appropriate legal basis , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Monday .

NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stressed the need for U.N. authorization . `` I ca n't imagine the international community and the United Nations would stand idly by if Gaddafi and his regime continue to attack their own people , '' he said . `` We have asked our military to conduct all necessary planning so that we stand ready at short notice , '' he added . NATO has launched 24-hour surveillance of Libya with AWACS reconnaissance aircraft , the U.S. ambassador to NATO said . Ivo Daalder added NATO representatives were discussing other possible moves ahead of a meeting of NATO ministers on Thursday . Western leaders , however , are anxious to avoid another drawn-out military commitment after the Iraq and Afghan wars . President Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals . '' In the rebel-held city of Misrata , the wounded were being treated on hospital floors because of a catastrophic shortage of medical facilities in the besieged city , a resident said . Misrata is the biggest city in the west not under the control of Gaddafi , and its stand against a militia commanded by his own son has turned it into a symbol of defiance . Zawiyah , just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , remained in rebel hands despite a push by government forces into the town , according to a Sky television report . It showed wounded fighters and civilians in Zawiya 's hospital , including a 10-year-old boy reportedly shot on his doorstep by government troops . In the east , warplanes launched air strikes on the rebel-held oil terminal town of Ras Lanuf 600 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli , witnesses said . One ripped through a car carrying a family . Shipping sources said the fighting had closed the oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Brega . Brent crude prices rose above $ 118 a barrel on Monday before falling back to $ 115 and U.S. prices pushed to their highest level since September 2008 . The fighting has been erratic , with small groups engaging each other , guerrilla-style , in hit and run raids . Air attacks have been fitful and bombing often inaccurate . The resilience of Gaddafi 's troops and their ability to counter-attack has raised the prospect of prolonged bloodshed . The United Nations and the European Union are dispatching fact-finding missions to the north African nation , where reports by residents of attacks on civilians by security forces have triggered a war crimes probe and provoked global outrage . The rebels have called for U.N.-backed air strikes against what they say are African soldiers-for-hire used by Gaddafi to crush the uprising against his four-decade rule . The Libyan government says it is fighting against al Qaeda terrorists and maintains its security forces have targeted only armed individuals attacking state institutions and depots . Government forces ' advance on Ras Lanuf forced residents to flee and rebels to hide weapons in the desert . One man complained of the rebels ' inexperience , as a fighter fired an automatic weapon ineffectually at a warplane . `` Look at the way they 're firing at the plane , '' he said . `` They have no experience , no leadership and no strategy . '' Al Jazeera quoted sources from the rebel interim council as saying it rejected Gaddafi 's proposal to quit because it would have been an `` honorable '' exit for him . The channel said Gaddafi had wanted guarantees of safety for him and his family and a pledge they not be put on trial .

One of Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said Libya would descend into civil war if his father stepped down , Al Arabiya television reported , adding that Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that the country 's tribes would fight each other . In an interview with France 24 television , Gaddafi said Libya was an important partner for the West in containing al Qaeda and illegal migrants trying to reach Europe . `` There are millions of blacks who could come to the Mediterranean to cross to France and Italy , and Libya plays a role in security in the Mediterranean , '' he said . So far tens of thousands of migrant workers have fled but few Libyans . `` If we get a massive outflow of Libyans , this would create a refugee situation , so we appeal to all countries to keep their doors open and be ready to provide assistance as humanitarian law requires , '' United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said . A British team reported to include special forces left Benghazi on Sunday after rebels captured and then released them .

The eastern city of Benghazi looks to have firmly thrown off control by Muammar Gaddafi , but the veteran leader looks to have managed to clamp down on unrest in the capital Tripoli and is besieging and battling to cement his control in nearby towns . Experts say the western conflict -- particularly the outcome of any uprising in Tripoli itself -- could decide Gaddafi 's fate . So could bargaining with the leaderships of major tribes . In the meantime , fighting seemed on Tuesday to be stalling along the coastal front between Benghazi and Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte -- an area that includes oil ports and refineries . `` In the short term , we 're looking at the de facto division of the country , '' said Control Risks analyst Henry Smith . The dividing point on the coastal strip looks to be around the oil refining and export towns of Brega and Ras Lanuf -- scene of recent fighting and air strikes . If confrontation along that front remains violent , it may further jeopardize oil sales . Oil sources told Reuters that both ports were now closed to traffic , although the eastern port of Tobruk -- now under control of the Benghazi-based opposition -- remained open . Businesses and diplomats face an awkward prospect of having to deal with a divided country , where payment to authorities in Tripoli may no longer ensure oil shipments from the east , and where relations may need restoring with a leader in the capital who Western powers said they wanted overthrown without delay . The example of Ivory Coast , divided since 2002 , is a reminder of how such civil conflicts can become entrenched . Both sides insist they will shortly triumph and reunite Libya . The rebels say Gaddafi is only just hanging on , playing down suggestions of looming de facto partition of the country . `` Gaddafi only has small pockets in Tripoli and other towns , '' said Ashour Shamis , a Libyan writer and editor of a pro-opposition online newspaper . `` All he has is his family . Libya is not divided . It has never been divided . '' But while many analysts believe there is widespread discontent with Gaddafi in western Libya , he may have enough troops and equipment to crush urban pockets of resistance and deter protesters from taking to the streets in the capital . His chances of demolishing the eastern opposition may be tougher , however , reflecting partly distance from the capital , but also deep-rooted differences between the historic provinces of Cyrenaica , around Benghazi , and Tripolitania , which Italian colonial rulers united to create modern Libya 80 years ago . `` The area around Benghazi has always been the center of resistance against both the Gaddafi regime and before it the Italian occupation , '' said Smith at Control Risks . The eastern rebels have taken the flag of the old monarchy from Cyrenaica , ousted by Gaddafi in a military coup in 1969 . Gaddafi has long relied heavily on members of his own Gaddadfa tribe from around Sirte , using them in key positions particularly in core `` regime protection '' units . But he has also built alliances with other groups through marriage and important government appointments . That has allowed him to weather previous tribal uprisings by groups such as the eastern-based Warfalla , widely seen as Libya 's largest tribe . Together with the second largest tribal group , the Margarha , they rebelled in 1993 against Gaddafi demanding greater representation in government . The revolt failed and a number of Warfalla leaders were killed , imprisoned or driven into exile -- although experts say they still retain a considerable presence within the military . After negotiations behind closed doors , the Margarha were able to maintain better ties with Gaddafi . However , many believe loyalties in the final analysis will also come down to more immediate personal decisions and relationships as commanders and leaders wait to back the winning side . Many tribes themselves break down into multiple subgroups . '' `` We 've seen various statements from various figures about the loyalty of their tribes , but it 's far from clear that structures are that simple , '' said Control Risks ' Smith . `` There will be a lot of people aiming to sit on the sidelines to see which way things go .

We further conclude that this relationship has , over a number of years , gone awry and needs to be re-calibrated ... we believe that problems in Afghanistan highlight the need for a corresponding cultural shift within Whitehall to ensure that those charged with taking foreign policy decisions and providing vitally important political leadership are able to question and appraise military advice with appropriate vigor , '' it said . During its enquiries , based on interviews with regional experts and officials , `` we gained the impression that the sheer size and power of the U.S. military ensured that the U.S. military remained largely in control of U.S. Afghan policy , '' it added . It also quoted former UK special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles , as saying that conversations between the U.S. and British military end up with things being pre-cooked between the U.S. and the UK militaries before they are subject to political approval back in London ... '' `` In Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles s view , the war in Afghanistan gave the British Army a raison d tre it has lacked for many years , new resources on an unprecedented scale and a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the U.S. following criticisms about the army s performance in Basra , Iraq . '' The comments in the report struck me as interesting , primarily because they were included at all -- `` civ-mil '' relations are not usually a hot topic for political debate in Britain . Otherwise they seemed to be largely a reflection of a far more heated discussion in Washington over the extent to which the U.S. military has come to dominate American foreign policy in the years following the Sept 11 , 2001 attacks and during two major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . For recent articles on the subject see Stephen Walt at Foreign Policy or Franz-Stefan Gady at the Small Wars Journal -LRB- pdf -RRB- For some time now , it has become conventional wisdom that the military has dominated strategy in Afghanistan -- when the army asked President Barack Obama for more troops , they got them . And the pundit consensus has been that Obama , after sacking two generals , had little room for maneuver even if he wanted to challenge the decisions made by his commander , the politically powerful General David Petraeus . But to what extent is this actually true ? Or perhaps more to the point , how far is the perceived dominance of the military a consequence rather than a cause of civilian weakness in setting foreign policy ? Ink Spots blog argues that the crisis in Libya provides an opportunity to at least reassess thinking on the perceived dominance of the military . '' One of the interesting aspects of the recent turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa is a reversal of militarisation . Many politicians have been calling for military intervention , particularly in Libya , and it has been the military pouring cold water on great ideas . How does this phenomenon fit into our understanding of civil-military relations at the national government level ? I 'm not sure yet , but I think it speaks volumes ... To extend the argument further , one of the problems in setting policy for Afghanistan -LRB- and the same applies to Pakistan , India and Kashmir -RRB- has been the lack of knowledge in the United States about the countries it aims to influence , whether by military or diplomatic means -- as eloquently argued by Manan Ahmed in The National and Joshua Foust at Registan.net . Far easier , then , to rely on military might . Yet that brings us to another peculiarity of the Libyan situation . Few people know very much about Libya since the country has been closed off for so long . So while there are plenty of arguments out there for and against military intervention , one of the less contested points is that it would not be terribly effective if you do n't know enough about the side you are backing , or about the potential consequences of that action . And as argued here , even a no-fly zone requires quite a lot of knowledge about what is happening on the ground if you do n't want to end up hitting the wrong targets , or jumping into unknown territory to rescue anyone who had been shot down . So which would you say came first ? Civilian lack of knowledge , or military power ? As a caveat , some would argue that the military has sucked up so many resources that there has been little left to develop civilian expertise . And that after two major wars , the U.S. military has little appetite or resources for intervening in yet another country . But in any case , food for thought . -LRB- Photo : A rebel fighter fires his rifle at a military aircraft loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at a checkpoint in Ras Lanuf March 7 , 2011 . REUTERS\\/Goran Tomasevic -RRB- One is reminded of Robert McNamara 's attempts to predict VietCong attacks using mainframe-based computer models . Real-life is much more messy -LRB- `` non-linear '' , in the words of the experts analyzing why those models failed -RRB- . Perhaps India should get bolder and increase its influence in Afghanistan . If a knowledge of local languages , dialects and customs is vitally important to understanding a culture and providing reliable intelligence , Indians would arguably be better at negotiating these than a Westerner . Also , given that there is a better inherent convergence of interests between the Indian and Afghan people than between the Afghans and other parties -LRB- the West , Russia , China or Pakistan -RRB- , this would be something worth exploring . Such a labour-intensive -LRB- HUMINT -RRB- rather than technology-intensive approach to intelligence also plays to India 's strengths . Of course , it will give the Pakistanis apoplexy , but that should n't be a concern . Proxy wars are the best course to take when one can not engage foreign military directly . For example , in Indian Kashmir , Pakistan tried direct military action and it did not help . But it started a proxy war and over a decade 's time , the tide had turned in favor of Pakistan and put India on the defensive . The Soviet Union engaged in Afghanistan directly and it was defeated by proxy war engagement . It is easier to engage two local parties against each other rather than come in directly and take the brunt of everything . In Iraq the US committed a blunder by direct engagement . It would have been easier to use Saddam Hussein to turn on the throttle against Iran and contain it rather than draw him into Kuwait and wage two direct wars against him . At the end the US achieved nothing . The Chinese always engage in proxy methods to contain its adversaries . China has surrounded itself with a bunch of rogue nations it calls as string of pearls and has quietly supported the regimes in those countries . In 2001 , when Al Qaeda attacked New York , it would have been prudent to bomb the Taliban out of Afghanistan and immediately engage the Northern alliance to complete the chase and control of the region . And NA could have been provided with all logistics and support to carry out the proxy war against the Taliban and its backers . With coercive diplomacy and sanctions on Pakistan , its efforts in backing the Taliban against the NA could have been contained . They all are locals and know the game and the terrain very well . This would have save a lot of money and efforts . Once in a while when it appears like Taliban gaining ground , a few missiles and drone strikes could have softened them up , forcing them to seek truce with NA . There would have been no need for setting up a puppet government in Kabul and chase the rats in the unknown territory . In Libya , anti-Gadhaffi factions could have been backed using proxy elements and with time , he could have been taken out by his own people . People feared the British empire because no one could predict which side they would support in every conflict . They support one side for sometime and dump them to make new alliances . So they made the proxy groups vie with each other for British support and gained control over both parties . Proxy wars are the way to contain territorial issues in geo-strategic hot spots . One reason why Pakistan desperately wants India out of Afghanistan is the potential for gains in the future where India will be able to weaken Pakistan 's proxy efforts . India can counter Pakistan 's efforts in Kashmir by pinching it from Afghanistan . An economically weak Pakistan will not be able to sustain proxy wars for too long . A lot of civil wars are looming in the horizon . It would be great if people take to revolution in North Korea , China , Burma , Cuba etc to throw out autocratic governments . And they can be helped by proxy means to achieve that goal . Could you explain the convergence of -LRB- national -RRB- interests between Indian and Afghan people in some detail . Could you explain the convergence of -LRB- national -RRB- interests between Indian and Afghan people in some detail . I was hoping you 'd ask . For a start , it might help to see what Afghans seem to think about this , rather than go by the opinion of one -LRB- obviously biased -RRB- Indian poster on this blog . -LRB- It also says a lot about the `` brotherhood '' we keep hearing about . You know , brotherhood is as brotherhood does . -RRB- And if you want more detail , the convergence of interests has to do with many things , notably trade . Afghanistan needs roads , dams , bridges , schools , hospitals -- lots of infrastructural development that India has been helping with . It 's more of a win-win arrangement than the patently self-serving approach of other countries , which gets reflected in popularity surveys . I guess the Afghans are not happy to be used as some other country 's defense shield . They 're happier when other countries do things for them that they want . Defense analyst Christine Fair has a couple of pieces on this relationship : I hope that answers your question . Right now the whole middle-east is too fluid and Pak-American spat over Davis is going to reset the relations . So I would hold my thoughts for a few days . Meanwhile , you work out your plans for Afghanistan . In terms of the US military , we do have to look at the last eight years . President Bush had a policy of mostly saying yes to the generals , and the pentagon . This behavior continued for eight years and the US military got used to having its way . Obama Wars by Woodward rightfully points this out . Obama was up against a whole different system when he decided to change things around in the Af-Pak policy . The generals were not used to having long policy discussions , and were not used to being asked to `` do more with less '' . The author is right that US could use more intimate knowledge of the South Asian actors . However , we have to go one step further . It is well known that the US , & Pakistan have divergent interests . Unless one of the two is willing to shift their fundamental focus , no amount of intimate knowledge of each other will help anyone . In the interm , the militaries fill the gaps and execute policy . The militaries are n't concerned with convergence , or divergence of interests . They have their mission goals , and they execute accordingly . Proxy wars are only good in the short term , and totally effective if they can reach a tipping point . However , with bigger countries like India which can sustain localized trouble , the proxy wars because part of the cost of doing business . Case in point : Kashmir . Moreover , proxy wars are costly , and unpredictable . I would also add India to the list of countries you 've given that might be possible candidates for civil war . There is a civil war going on in central India with the Maoists -LRB- calling them an insurgency does n't change the reality -RRB- . But again , situation is manageable because of the size of India . Biased or not , I state only my opinions and do not claim to represent anyone . Could you explain the convergence of -LRB- national -RRB- interests between Indian and Afghan people in some detail . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Pakistan and Sri Lanka Do you share any of the following links with either one of the above countries ? : We can discuss the interests of Pakistani people with nationals of Nepal . High-quality fake Indian currency printed at Pakistani government press is released into India through Nepal . Other pakistani interests in Nepal involve money laundering , drug trafficking , slipping in trained terrorists , and hosting pakistani hijackers at the Pakistani embassy to hijack Indian airlines flight . According to a top US military official , Lashkar-e-Taiba -LRB- LeT -RRB- , the Pakistani terrorist organization , is quickly expanding operations to South Asian countries other than India including Nepal . In his opening statement , Admiral Willard said , The Asia Pacific region is quickly becoming the strategic nexus of the globe due to its economic expansion and great potential . In regard to Nepal , the Admiral reported , `` Right now our concern is the movement of Lashkar-e Taiba , the terrorist group that emanates from Pakistan that was responsible for the Mumbai attacks in India , and specifically their positioning in Bangladesh and Nepal , the Maldives and Sri Lanka . '' Senator George Lemieux asked about the dynamics of the Indo-American partnership in combating LeT terrorism . Admiral Willard s response : We are working very closely with the Indians and we are working within our own community to develop the necessary plans to counter that particular terrorist group as they migrate into the Asia Pacific region . I think the poll stats , referred by Ganesh , are most telling . It 's a scientific poll conducted 3 reputable international organizations & includes all ethnic groups of Afghanistan -LRB- not just Pashtuns or non-Pashtuns -RRB- . The fact that 74 % Afghans have a favorable opinion of India & just 8 % , of Pakistan AND 91 % have an unfavorable opinion of Pakistan whereas 21 % view India unfavorably , should put to bed any argument , as to which country has the moral right to be in Afghanistan . The US seems to be looking for a way to do a 180-degree turn on Pakistan without losing face , but have not yet found one . -LRB- Of course , this could be wishful thinking by an Indian , but I do hear increasing rumblings . -RRB- Gen Kayani is by his own admission , the most anti-Indian general in recent times . `` India-centric '' is a euphemism for `` I joined the Pakistan army on the eve of its greatest defeat in 1971 , and I 'll never forgive you , you b \\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\* s ! '' To give him his due , he has so far masterfully translated this attitude into gains for Pakistan , although his simultaneous anti-US actions could be his undoing . Manmohan Singh is the softest Indian PM on Pakistan in recent memory . This probably owes much to his birth in Pakistan -LRB- before partition -RRB- and his desire to achieve a peace treaty -LRB- and possibly a Nobel Peace Prize -RRB- before he leaves office . There is the real danger -LRB- from India 's perspective -RRB- that he will give away the store in pursuit of this quest . Certainly he is not exploiting India 's strengths in the shrewdest way possible . All three factors are temporary , I believe , and will not last beyond 3 years . Once the US withdraws from Afghanistan -LRB- at least substantially by 2014 -RRB- , they can simultaneously disengage themselves from the last vestiges of dependence on Pakistan and thenceforth say and do as they please . Gen Kayani 's term -LRB- after the extension -RRB- ends in 3 years , in 2013 . Hopefully , the next general will be more genuinely professional . Manmohan Singh has stated he will not be seeking a fresh term . Any government after the 2014 elections will be more aware of India 's strength and more willing to use it to pursue India 's interests , unburdened by personal childhood sentiment . The three-way relationship will then find a new equilibrium . Once the US withdraws from Afghanistan -LRB- at least substantially by 2014 -RRB- , they ... . Gen Kayani s term -LRB- after the extension -RRB- ends in 3 years , in 2013 . Hopefully , the next general will be more genuinely professional . Manmohan Singh has stated he will not be seeking a fresh term . Any government after the 2014 ... . '' Agree with # 1 & 3 , not sure about # 2 . Also , I hope that next Indian PM is not of the pre-1947 generation who carries the burden of the partition . We need some fresh eyes to look at Pakistan & deal with it . No more Manmohan Singhs or Advanis please . It 's time for venom against hinduism , now . -LRB- 2 -RRB- What the fuXX is purushamedha ?

You have to admit netizen 's latest post is at least as funny as your series of amu-Singh jokes . I always felt , you were somewhat queer Shahidkhan : `` you read a lot but understand little . Muslims don t need money or economy , they volunteer for free . Would an Indian volunteer for free ? LOL LOL LOL . '' And we want to build our wealth , improve our economy and volunteer to help when countries like yours is begging for money when floods wreak havoc . `` There will be support for Kashmirs in kashmir , afghanistan , pakistan and india itself until it is resolved . '' Looks like there is severe unemployment problem in your world . I hear many are sweeping the streets in London as well . And some might have been unemployed for generations and do not feel like working anymore . A gun or a knife comes in handy to make quick bucks . In fact your whole nation is turning into one . Ganesh : `` Once the US withdraws from Afghanistan -LRB- at least substantially by 2014 -RRB- , they can simultaneously disengage themselves from the last vestiges of dependence on Pakistan and thenceforth say and do as they please . '' In 1989 they did that . They demolished the USSR and went home to work on the new world order . Little did they know at that time that they will be forced to come back to this garbage pile a decade later . This time if they go , they will be laughed at as losers . There are enough people in Af-Pak who are experts at writing distorted history . They might decide to blackmail the US by going rogue if the US does not give them money . That is probably why they are building nukes at the expense of everything else . They can blackmail US business by pointing their Jihadist barrel at India . The US has to remove the nukes from this country . Otherwise there is going to be no peace in this region . The Military has a tendency to produce more balanced , sound and efficient leaders . Their physical training , mental capacity and ability to stay calm under pressure means they can handle the situations pretty well . They can be a good stabilizing force , and fill the power vaccum in countries where civilian leaders can not take responsibility . But overdoing the role of military is equally bad . Only a balanced approach should work . Guys please cut the crap and come back to a good debate , exchange views , ideas , share links etc. do some good . We were getting worried about your safety when you went silent for a long time . -LRB- I am sincere in saying this -- this is not sarcasm . -RRB- The author is talking about the role of military in terms of policy making , and policy application . In my opinion , the relationship beetween the Af-Pak situation , and the Libyan can not be made . The US already knows about Pakistan and vice versa . Both actors have fundamental differences over their objectives in Af . Contrary to what the author claims , the US military does not dominate US foreign policy . The military might be very efficient implementing the policy . There is only one country where the military has played a big role in foreign policy : Pakistan . This is because historically the military has been in charge , and the civilian framework has failed to progress accordingly . The topic of this article is quite interesting . On same lines a financial analysis thrown up would be that role of military is directly proportional to the of budget spent on defence\\/war\\/military . The magical number is somehow around 10 % . As soon as any country 's defense budget % croses 10 % or so then only 3 paths are pursued -- 1 . military rule or 2 . division of teritorry or 3 . Pakistan has experienced the first two and afghanistan and middle-east are experiencing the last one . But on other hand if defense budgets go down below 3-5 % then such countries expose themselves to risk of being bullied\\/annexed by more powerful nations . So I would agree with Umair is that a balance is needed . But where I disagree with Umair is that military can not produce good leaders simply because in starting all looks good with military dominance but as things progress the real face is seen . Lets be very clear that military men -LRB- irrespective of country , caste , religion , culture , creed , etc -RRB- are trained killers and killers should NEVER be allowed to run countries and decide fates of millions and billions . And we all can see what happens when military dominance is high in countries like Pakistan , Mynammar , Afghanistan , Libya , Iraq , Yemen , Yugosalavia , etc. . On other hand are countries like India , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Indonesia , Turkey , Germany , France , etc where military plays a supporting role to governments and DOES NOT guide the policies of government . -LRB- I have deliberately not included US in either of the lists -RRB- The difference is quite visible . So balance is the key . Military 's role is to assist and not rule . The biggest drawback of military rulers is that they are , by training , not capable of flexibility in dealing with delicate situations involving civilians and local politics . When dealing with civilian counterparts and citizens , there has to be the capacity to make compromises and sometimes even let go of one 's stand in the interest of harmony . The military mind is trained to seeing things and black and white , there can be no shades of gray when involved . And rightly so for their professional responsibilty which is combat . This effectively rules them out as being able able and long term administrators of civilian affairs . To my mind the biggest blunder the US committed in Iraq was to let the Pentagon take charge of affairs there after Saddam 's fall . Had the State Department , instead of the Defense Department been in charge of day to day administration , quite likely there would have been a more peaceful and perhaps also a faster transition . In many African countries , the Middle East and all the way up to NW Pakistan , tribal societies exist . Tribes have very strong influence on their members and tribal rivalries are deep and go back over many centuries . This is how they have evolved over generations . In such societies , tribal chiefs -LRB- who are not elected -RRB- play a significant role . They spend their time negotiating deals with other tribes and settling scores . It is very similar to the caste system in India . Loyalty to one 's tribal group is much stronger than anything else . So when a nation is formed , usually one tribe dominates the others . When colonial powers came in , they played the tribes against each other and made gains . In Libya Ghaddaffi 's tribe dominates others . He worked on weakening the tribes on the Eastern part of his country . Typically tribal leaders fill up military ranks with their people . If there are rich resources like oil , the tribal members get first preference in all the money . This helps them dominate others . That is what has happened in Libya . What one sees there is not really a people 's revolution like one saw in Egypt . It is a large scale tribal conflict in which the tribes in the East have managed to wriggle themselves out . Military defectors belong to tribes that are different from Ghaddaffi 's . So Ghaddaffi is running the show with military members loyal to him -LRB- mostly his tribesmen -RRB- and the money he has accumulated . Libya can go the way of post Soviet era Afghanistan if Ghaddaffi is removed . Tribes will try to regain what they lost and balance each other out . I heard on the radio that the military structure in Libya is built along tribal lines . Ghadaffi did try to diffuse this tribal loyalty , but seems to have failed . He himself is relying on it for his survival now . In Egypt and Tunisia it was a very different phenomenon . Libya may not go the way the other two did . Glad to see you & thanks for bringing the discussion back on track . I agree with you that a country 's army can play a crucial role to fill in the power vaccum during transitional periods -LRB- like currently in Egypt -RRB- . But Pakistan has had a functional & legitimate democracy since it 's creation , despite the flaws faced by all democracies in developing countries -LRB- India , Bangladesh , Turkey etc -RRB- . The problem in case of Pakistan , is that the army is allowed to ovver-ride the civilian govt on many issues , including foreign policy & defense spending & this undermines democracy . Ultimately , it 's the pakistani poeple who should decide -LRB- through elected representatives -RRB- about ALL major issues concerning the country & the military should take orders from the civilian govt instead of the other way around . I know that democracy can be very frustrating but have some patience . More than 90 % of India 's elected officials are also corrupt & inept clowns but there have been some good ones ' as well & it 's finally paying off . All foreigners will be treated as trespassers and would be shot on sight or taken as hostages and would be set free against a fixed amount to be paid in cash , kaldar not Afghan currency . Afghan currency is for non Pashtoons who happen to be living in Afghanistan but have never proven to be loyal . This is a country of beautiful orchards and valleys where most warriors of the world have found a last resting place . Those who were braver than the Pashtoons went back to their home countries in Greece , Turkey , England , Scotland , Moscow , Petersbarg and the last one virginia , texas , and some to new york , and lastly not to forget some to European countris . The show is coming soon to close , the American military and its leaders have learned their lessons , never to engage again their military in a muslim land . Any one who would suggest to the USA President to do so needs to have his head examined , says Robert Gates . The American power has had enough of the adventures ! Now what was the discussion about India engaging with Afghanistan ? Ths is something they love most , people from the past who worship statues and do not believe in God . Had they known this in advance they wuld not have destroyed their Gods in Bhamian ? What India can do is to provide some of the millions of its slaves -LRB- Indian labor Minister calls them bonded labor and denies they ae slaves -RRB- to cear up the mess the Americans are going to leave . `` >> -RRB- Believe me you , I would unfurl that turban shlowly , shlowly . '' Posted by shahidkhan123 Would that be , before or after the stripping of your burka ? @Rex minor : As someone , who 's not an Afghan or a Pashtun or even from the region -LRB- as you claim -RRB- , you sure have a lot of authority to speak for the Afghan people . -RRB- More than 90 % of India s elected officials are also corrupt & inept clowns but there have been some good ones as well & it s finally paying off . -RRB- I have to disagree here . A professional army s job is to protect the country , deter the enemy , retrieve stolen land not run cricket boards . Good to see some dissent on the role of the military from another Paistani . I was beginning to think all Pakistanis were uncritical worshippers of the army . Ironically , Umair , it is on account of such dissenting opinions that I would agree with you that there is still hope for Pakistan . But to your point Shahid , in most other jobs , if someone repeatedly fails to perform an assigned task , they are usually sacked . Since the Pakistan army has n't managed to `` retrieve stolen land '' -LRB- a task you believe they are responsible for -RRB- in 63 years in spite of various failed attempts , and has in fact lost a significant amount of land in the east thanks to its own genocidal actions , what do you think needs to be done with it ? -LRB- I suggest a change of job description to something more realistic and achievable . -RRB- `` Considering the recent scandals , perhaps paying off is the right term after all '' Good one , Ganesh . Bad choice of words by me . The lack of accountability , of those in power , is astonishing & frustrating at the same time . I ca n't wait for the day when such scumbags will be hanged for ripping off a country where hundreds of millions live without the most basic of amenities . `` give me some insider s information '' I 'm afraid , you 're completely on your own on that one ! Thanks for concern , though i have been busy at work lately , but spring time has arrived and weather is good in Islamabad . As for the military 's role in Pakistan , since civilian democracy is infant . I always argue , democracy under the watchful eyes of the Army is the only option for Pakistan for now . I have yet to see a more patriotic institution in Pakistan than the Pakistan Army . It has given its sweat and blood for the country and earned its respect . For any of its shortcomings , i will choose the army over democracy any day . But the good thing is , the Army in Pakistan now fully supports democracy . Take care everyone . -RRB- One thing I don t like about democracy in pakistan is people voting along ethnic or party lines . why not pick the most eligible , honest person ? For this , we can only blame ourselves . the other thing i don t like is our political parties are like family property , they get passed down through generations . I only have to replace two words here -LRB- Pakistan and ethnic -RRB- to form another completely true paragraph : One thing I don t like about democracy in India is people voting along caste or party lines . why not pick the most eligible , honest person ? For this , we can only blame ourselves . the other thing i don t like is our political parties are like family property , they get passed down through generations . You have a limited perception of democracy in Pakistan ! Pakistan Democracy has time and again faled to give dignity to the people of Pakistan . Pakistan military were more sensitive to dignity , but also failed after taking the civilian Govt . task of administeration and development of the Nation . Today Pakistan is no different than it was half a century before and the state of limbo has dragged on . India is its enemy No. 1 , with full diplomatic relations , and the the Americans are there to help maintain the military and provide weaponry , but in real time Pakistan military has never admitted defeat at the hands of Indian miliary , though unconditional surrender is a historical document , no different from the surrender of the Third Reich . Shame on today 's Generals who are visiting Washington and calling on Colin Powel who threatend Musharaf Din the stone age . The General of Ayub 's calibre , who was the first to remove the civilian head and took over the reins of the Govt . could never have stooped down so low that today 's Pakistan has even lost the meaning of the word ` DIGNITY ' . Nor would the military continue to support clandastine operations against India and the Pashtoon Nation , almost half of them live in todays Pakistan and the other half in Afghanistan . today is as unpopular in Afghanistan as it used to be in sixties ! What Pakistan needs is the direct democracy for the people , so that legislations are made with people 's participation and not military participation . Pakistan military should be confined to barracks outside the cities . That Pakistan future still hangs in the middle of Sardari and sharif Bros on one side and the military on the other side which is equivalent to a permanent Babylonian prison .

Full Article Libya no-fly zone talks , protracted conflict looms RAS LANUF , Libya | Tue Mar 8 , 2011 2:16 pm IST RAS LANUF , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain and France spearheaded a drive at the United Nations for a no-fly zone over Libya as battles raged across the country and Muammar Gaddafi 's son said a civil war would erupt if his father stepped down . The White House pushed back against rising pressure from some U.S. lawmakers for direct intervention in Libya , saying it first wanted to figure out what military options could achieve in this oil-producing desert state which is wracked by conflict . Civilians were surrounded by Gaddafi forces in two western towns , Misrata and Zawiyah , and in the east warplanes hit the rebel-held oil terminal town of Ras Lanuf as strikes and counter-attacks pointed to an increasingly protracted conflict . Two Arab papers and al Jazeera television said Gaddafi was looking for a pact allowing him to step down , but there was no official confirmation of the reports . Gaddafi in public has vowed to fight on and never leave Libya . One of Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said in an interview with Al Arabiya television his father had not yet thrown his army into full battle against the rebels , saving it to shield Libya against foreign attack and to protect `` sensitive sites '' . `` The tribes are all armed , there are forces from the Libyan army and the eastern region is armed . The situation is not like Tunisia or Egypt , '' said Saadi . `` If something happened to the leader , who would be in control ? A civil war would start . '' The battlefield in eastern Libya around important oil terminals has become mired in attack and counter-attack between the loose-knit rebel army of young volunteers and defectors and the Libyan armed forces in a buffer zone of barren landscape between the east and the west of Libya . The largely inexperienced rebels lack the firepower of their rivals . They have no warplanes to back them up and rely mostly on heavy machineguns , anti-aircraft weapons and rocket propelled grenades . They travel by 4x4 pick-up trucks . But their agility , often fairly chaotic at the front , has given them a degree of protection from Gaddafi 's forces , who have proved more effective at quashing the rebellion in the west around the Libyan leader 's Tripoli powerbase . U.N. aid coordinator Valerie Amos said the fighting across Libya meant that more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian aid . `` Humanitarian organizations need urgent access now , '' she said . `` People are injured and dying and need help immediately . '' The United Nations appealed for $ 160 million for an operation over the next months to prepare shelter , food and medicine . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said London was working with its partners `` on elements of a resolution on a no-fly zone , making clear the need for regional support , a clear trigger for such a resolution and an appropriate legal basis '' . A French source said France also was working with its U.N. partners on a no-fly zone resolution . Gulf states called for a no-fly zone and an urgent Arab League meeting . Western allies differ over how a no-fly zone might be implemented . The United States has said it would involve a large-scale military operation , including strikes on Libyan air defences , but some military analysts have said it could be limited to preventing flights in Libyan airspace , without a big preliminary campaign . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , in Afghanistan where foreign forces have struggled for a decade , said action should be taken only with international backing . The White House said all options were on the table , including arming rebels . Russia , a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto powers , said it opposed foreign military intervention . NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stressed the need for U.N. authorisation . `` I ca n't imagine the international community and the United Nations would stand idly by if Gaddafi and his regime continue to attack their own people , '' he said . NATO has launched 24-hour surveillance of Libya with AWACS reconnaissance aircraft , the U.S. ambassador to NATO said . U.S. President Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals '' . As the international community sought to isolate Gaddafi 's government , Japan said on Tuesday it had imposed sanctions on Libya , including freezing assets of Gaddafi and several other Libyans , in line with a U.N. Security Council resolution . `` Based on the U.N. resolution , the cabinet agreed that Japan would carry out these measures , for the sake of unity with the international community , '' Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told a news conference after a cabinet meeting . In the rebel-held city of Misrata , the wounded were being treated on hospital floors because of a catastrophic shortage of medical facilities in the besieged city , a resident said . Misrata is the biggest city in the west not under the control of Gaddafi , and its stand against a militia commanded by his own son has turned it into a symbol of defiance . Zawiyah , just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , was in rebel hands despite a government forces ' push , Sky television said . In the east , warplanes launched strikes on the rebel-held oil town of Ras Lanuf 600 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli . One ripped through a car carrying a family . Shipping sources said the fighting had closed the Ras Lanuf terminal and the oil port of Brega . Brent crude prices rose above $ 118 a barrel on Monday before falling back to $ 115 and U.S. prices pushed to their highest level since September 2008 . Youcef Yousfi , president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries , said there were no plans for a crisis meeting of the group and high prices were short term . The Libyan government says it is fighting against al Qaeda terrorists and maintains its security forces have targeted only armed individuals attacking state institutions and depots . Al Jazeera quoted sources from the rebel interim council as saying it rejected Gaddafi 's proposal to quit because it would have been an `` honorable '' exit for him . The channel said Gaddafi had wanted guarantees of safety for him and his family and a pledge they not be put on trial . Jadallah Azous Al-Talhi , a former prime minister , earlier appeared on state television to urge rebels to `` give a chance to national dialogue to resolve this crisis '' . Ahmed Jabreel , an aide to rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil , said : `` Any negotiations must be on the basis that Gaddafi will step down . There can be no other compromise . '' So far tens of thousands of migrant workers have fled but few Libyans . `` If we get a massive outflow of Libyans , this would create a refugee situation , so we appeal to all countries to keep their doors open and be ready to provide assistance as humanitarian law requires , '' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said .

The move follows a decision by major U.S. oil firms to halt trade with Libya and makes it almost impossible for European firms to buy Libyan oil and supply refineries in countries such as France and Italy . Around half of Libya 's oil output , or more than 1 percent of global supply , has already been choked off by lethal clashes between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . `` Banks do n't want to finance the system in Libya , so for the moment no one is getting money for oil . There are big problems for payments , '' said a senior trader with a European oil company . Oil prices hit their highest since September 2008 on Monday as cuts in Libyan exports piled pressure on OPEC to boost output . Goldman Sachs bank said OPEC 's spare capacity to cushion lost output was much smaller than thought .

Arab media had reported that the Libyan leader had reached out to the council to offer talks on Gaddafi 's departure , which is the central demand of rebels who have seized swathes of the country mainly in the east from the Libyan leader 's control . A council source on Monday told Reuters he had heard of a proposal that Gaddafi hand power to the head of parliament and leave Libya with a guaranteed sum of money . He had also said the council saw the cash element as an obstacle . In fiery and defiant speeches , Gaddafi has vowed to fight on and has told his supporters he will never leave Libya . Officials from the council , which is based in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi , did not confirm any Gaddafi proposal on Monday , but on Tuesday a spokesman confirmed it was made . `` I confirm that we received contact from a Gaddafi representative seeking to negotiate Gaddafi 's exit , '' a media officer for the council , Mustafa Gheriani , told Reuters . `` We rejected this . We are not negotiating with someone who spilled Libyan blood and continues to do so . Why would we trust the guy today ? '' The Libyan government or Gaddafi 's representatives have not issued any comment on such a proposal but his son , Saadi Gaddafi , told an Arabic channel that if the leader did step down Libya would descend into civil war . The head of the rebel council , Mustafa Abdel Jalil , told Al Arabiya television by telephone : `` Now the first demand is that he announces his departure , and only after that perhaps Libyans will stop pursuing him for crimes . '' `` There are indirect contacts with the Americans at the presidential level , '' he added , without giving details . Al Jazeera also cited Abdel Jalil as saying that there was `` no chance for Gaddafi 's rule over Libya to continue '' . It quoted an Al Jazeera correspondent saying there were talks about mediation by a foreign state to secure a safe exit for Gaddafi .

Security Council is split on whether to authorize a no-fly zone over Libya as Britain and France consider tougher options for Tripoli , including setting up an escrow account for oil revenues , envoys said on Wednesday . Britain and France have been preparing a draft U.N. resolution that would authorize a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent airstrikes against civilians in the North African country where rebels are seeking to oust long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi . The United States , however , has made clear to London and Paris that the administration of President Barack Obama is in the throes of a policy review and is not ready `` to go full steam ahead on a no-fly zone at the moment , '' a Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity . The British and French , however , are consulting with Washington and other allies so that they are ready to submit a draft resolution to the 15-nation Security Council immediately in the event of an `` egregious act '' against civilians by forces loyal to Gaddafi . `` If they were to bomb a school and kill a dozen children , the French and British are ready to move immediately with a draft on the no-fly zone issue , '' another diplomat said . But the idea of a no-fly zone lacks sufficient support at the moment among council members . Veto powers China and Russia dislike it , India and South Africa are skeptical , and the Americans are undecided , envoys said . `` If we put it on the table today , I do n't think there would be enough support for it , '' a diplomat said . But he added that no council members had categorically ruled it out . In order to pass , Security Council resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent members , which also include the United States , Britain and France . `` Other options are being discussed , '' another diplomat said . `` One of those is an escrow account for Libyan oil revenues to prevent Gaddafi from getting all the nation 's oil money . '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague told parliament this week that a U.N.-administered escrow account similar to one set up for Iraq in the 1990s was an option being considered by Britain and its allies . The United Nations ' `` oil-for-food '' program in Iraq -- which allowed Iraq to sell oil in order to buy humanitarian goods -- was hit with allegations of widespread corruption , and U.N. officials have said privately that there is little appetite to get back in the business of administering oil revenues . Libya 's deputy U.N. ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi , whose denunciation of Gaddafi last month sparked dozens of defections of Libyan envoys worldwide , said he did not support the idea . `` There is no need for this , '' Dabbashi , a key member of the Libyan opposition , told Reuters . `` We have a government in place ready to take power . We do n't support an escrow account . '' Dabbashi said the Security Council should speed up talks on a no-fly zone and authorize it `` as soon as possible . '' Other options include modifying the Libyan arms embargo to allow the arming of the rebels . The arms embargo and other punitive measures were part of a Security Council sanctions resolution on February 26 . At the moment , an exemption would only be possible with the unanimous advance approval of all 15 council members . But Russia and China , which consider Libya to be in the throes of a full-scale civil war , are loath to have the Security Council taking sides against Gaddafi , diplomats said . They added that other council members dislike the idea of the council explicitly authorizing the arming of Libyan rebels . The key option , they said , remains the idea of a Security Council-authorized no-fly zone , which would be enforced by NATO but would ideally include participation of Arab and African nations to avoid the appearance of it being an exclusively U.S.-European military operation . `` Having Arabs and Africans would be helpful , '' a diplomat said , adding that even symbolic participation would be good . The French and British are also waiting to see whether the Arab League , African Union and European Union will formally agree to support a no-fly zone , diplomats said . Such a zone could take any number of forms , the envoys said , ranging from a military operation intended to shoot down any Libyan aircraft violating a flight ban to a zone where reconnaissance planes and satellites would monitor violations and pass the information to the International Criminal Court .

In the west , Gaddafi 's army laid siege to try to starve out insurgents clinging to parts of the shattered city of Zawiyah , strategically significant because it is close to his powerbase in the capital Tripoli , after fierce see-saw battles this week . But the rebels took an important step toward international legitimacy when France recognized their national council . While oil prices have been kept high by the bombardments in the east of the Arab North African state , there was no clear sign of deliberate intent by Gaddafi to ruin oil infrastructure . NATO and the European Union were looking into imposing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya to stop the government using jets and helicopters against the outgunned rebels , who seized a string of cities east and west of Tripoli early in the three-week-old war to end Gaddafi 's 41 years of iron-fisted rule . Despite rebel appeals to take the skies away from Gaddafi 's forces , no quick action was expected as NATO has made clear it needs wider , United Nations endorsement for such a move . More than 500 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , Gaddafi 's warplanes and gunboats off the Mediterranean coast bombarded rebels around Ras Lanuf , with projectiles crashing close to a building of the Libyan Emirates Oil Refinery Company . There was a series of air strikes , and insurgents fired anti-aircraft guns toward warplanes and rockets out to sea toward Gaddafi 's naval forces , without visible effect . Two rebel fighters said they saw Ras Lanuf 's residential area , including the vicinity of its hospital , get bombed and that government forces had fired rockets from sea , air and ground . There was no apparent damage to the hospital . Later , at least two tanks were seen bearing down on ragged rebel lines outside Ras Lanuf and opening fire . The rebels also reported an air strike on Brega , another oil port 90 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- east of Ras Lanuf , indicating that Gaddafi loyalists had not only halted a westwards insurgent push in its tracks but were making inroads into the rebels ' eastern centers . State television said rebels had been ousted from the port and airport of Es Sider , a further oil terminus about 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- up the coast west of Ras Lanuf . OPEC member Libya was turning away tankers from ports as storage depots dried up because of supply disruptions caused by the fighting . Libya 's oil trade has virtually been paralyzed as banks refuse to clear payments in dollars due to U.S. sanctions , cutting off major importers such as Italy and France . The intensified fighting near oil installations kept crude prices hovering near recent 2.5-year highs , with Brent crude trading at $ 114.55 a barrel . The rebels , hitherto bursting with confidence that they would soon charge hundreds of km -LRB- miles -RRB- up the Mediterranean desert coast , overwhelming any resistance , to capture Gaddafi 's main bastion Tripoli , now conceded they were struggling to hold ground against the government 's vastly superior firepower . '' -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- might take it . With planes , tanks , mortars and rockets , he might take it , '' said rebel fighter Basim Khaled . `` A no-fly zone would be great , '' said rebel fighter Salem al-Burqy , echoing the view of many beleaguered cohorts . Gaddafi 's counter-offensive has stymied a rebel advance from their eastern power base of Benghazi . They were forced to withdraw from the front-line town of Bin Jawad , just west of Ras Lanuf , after coming under heavy shelling earlier this week . One fighter said rebels had retaken the heart of Zawiyah , the closest city -- 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west -- to Tripoli , from the army overnight . Zawiyah 's center appeared to change hands twice during the day in a fierce battle . `` We fought until after three in the morning . It 's all quiet here this morning , '' said the insurgent , named Ibrahim , by phone . Mohamed , a Libyan in exile abroad who got through to a relative on the outskirts of Zawiyah Thursday morning , said it was simply not clear who was winning the battle for the city but the army had it under siege to break the rebels ' will . `` Yesterday -LRB- rebel sympathizers -RRB- tried to bring food and medicine from Subratha but failed . Government troops surround Zawiyah from everywhere . It is unclear who controls the center . It changes all the time . It 's street to street fighting . '' Authorities have kept journalists away from Zawiyah . France became the first significant country Thursday to recognize the rebel Libyan National Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . An official at President Nicolas Sarkozy 's office said France would send an ambassador to Benghazi and receive a Libyan envoy in Paris . He was speaking after Sarkozy met officials from the Libyan National Council . Britain 's Foreign Office suggested it could make the same opening as France , saying Libyan National Council members were `` valid interlocutors '' and Gaddafi should step down now . `` The UK recognizes states , not governments . The interim national council are valid interlocutors , with whom we wish to work closely , '' a Foreign Office spokesman said . The U.S. Defense Department said it was preparing a `` full range '' of military options for Libya , including a no-fly zone . NATO ministers were to weigh up options at talks in Brussels on Thursday . Military officers said a zone could be set up quickly . Rebel forces have appealed to Washington and its allies to impose a no-fly zone to deny Gaddafi 's forces the advantage of using warplanes and prevent him moving troops by helicopter . A no-fly zone could also help protect civilians who have been caught in the fighting , with scores if not more people reported killed so far in cities like Zawiyah . A burgeoning humanitarian emergency could hasten a no-fly decision . CALL TO AVOID SHOOTING AT CIVILIANS In Geneva , the International Committee of the Red Cross said Libya had descended into civil war with increasing numbers of wounded civilians arriving in hospitals in the east . ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called on Libyan authorities to grant the humanitarian agency access to western areas including the capital Tripoli and reminded both sides that civilians and medical facilities must not be targeted . General Raymond Odierno , commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command , said the U.S. military was probably capable of establishing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya `` within a couple of days '' if the international community so decided . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made it clear imposing a no-fly zone is a matter for the United Nations and should not be a U.S.-led initiative . Russia and China , permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , oppose the idea , which could entail bombing Libyan air defenses as a first step . Russia said Thursday military intervention would be unacceptable , but acted to help isolate Gaddafi by banning all weapons sales to Libya , effectively suspending major arms contracts with his government . Italy , whose bases could play a critical role in any military action , has said it will back any decisions taken by NATO , the EU or the United Nations , clearing the way for U.S. naval forces based in Naples to be deployed if needed . Two members of Libya 's opposition council visited the European Parliament Wednesday and said they wanted EU moral support , political recognition and a no-fly zone shielding the territory they hold -- but not any form of military intervention in a country sensitive about former colonial domination . Counter-attacks by Gaddafi loyalists suggest the flamboyant leader , in power since a 1969 coup , will not go as quietly or quickly as fellow leaders in Egypt and Tunisia did in a tide of popular unrest rolling across the Arab world . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It is simply a fantasy he wo n't attack them . When loyalists can not overtake the strong-hold of the rebels , the pro-Gadi camp is likely to destroy the enemy 's wealth i.e. oil facilities . What a tragedy the world is watching unfold in front of us . Not for Gaddafi or the rebels but for the hundreds of innocent men women and children who a getting killed as a result of this battle . Every day I read in news items of what the world s powers are going to do or can do but the bottom line while they are all thinking about it nothing is getting done . The truth is that no matter what they say they are doing they in fact are waiting to see how this conflict unfolds and then they can take the appropriate action that will not leave them with egg on their face . Hilary Clinton like a school kid when asked to participate is saying `` We will if you will `` . Can we really blame the Americans for this attitude when they are already extremely unpopular because of their involvement in other Arab world issues , not forgetting Israel . Europe don t seem to be rushing to Hilary s aid and are making statements such as `` we could have this No fly zone in place very quickly if necessary `` but they are not implemeting it , and if Italy are seen to be pro rebels they have a lot to lose if Gaddafi wins . The Russians and China have their own agendas for reasons similar to Italy , what if Gaddafi wins , all their trade with Lybia goes down the pan . Finally the Arab world , they may not like Gaddafi but they have seen rebellions in other Arab countries oust their presidents , a win for the rebels in Lybia would really open the flood gates for the remaining Arab world . Saudia rulers have already stated that protests in their country will not be allowed so a win for Gaddafi will strengthen their position . The bottom line is that the Lybian rebels based on what they saw in Egypt hoped they could topple Gaddafi easily , and if needed the rest of the world would support them . Well I m sorry folks but it appears that the rest of the world are thinking about it and thinking about and thinking about it . `` Libya will turn into civil war if my father steps down '' , so said by Gaddafi 's son . The civil war already started 3 weeks ago , it will end when his father flees or faces death penalty . `` The no-fly zone has to be sanctioned by U.N. security council '' , so said by Hillary Clinton .

'' The ICRC , one of the few international aid agencies in Libya , has set up a base in rebel-held Benghazi in the east where it is helping to perform surgery and supply hospitals . Kellenberger had no overall casualty figures for the country or reports from the western city of Zawiyah , which appeared to change hands twice on Wednesday . Valerie Amos , U.N. emergency relief coordinator , said of Zawiyah in the U.N. 's latest report : `` Residents reported bullets being fired , with women and children being killed and families trapped in their homes . '' Kellenber said fighting had intensified and doctors had witnessed a sharp rise in casualties , with at least 22 killed and 40 wounded in Misrata after air strikes . Some 55 wounded were treated in Ajdabiyah hospital in the east this week . Top Libyan authorities , whom he declined to name , had told him there was no need for outside help in the areas held by Libyan forces , said Kellenberger , a former Swiss diplomat . `` We do n't know what the humanitarian needs are in areas controlled by Tripoli . I was told everything is under control , all hospitals are working perfectly , there is no need for external humanitarian assistance , '' he said . `` Our first priority is to have access to areas controlled by Tripoli . '' U.N. agencies remain shut out from Libya for security reasons , but are increasingly alarmed at sketchy reports of mounting casualties in besieged cities , U.N. officials said on Wednesday . -LRB- Editing by Jonathan Lynn and Robert Woodward -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Yet the hardships and violence poured onto the people of Libya by Gaddafi pale in comparison to the murderous onslaught poured onto the people of Iraq by America for the sake of oil . American troops , from the air and on the ground , murdered tens of thousands of Iraqi humans in the most horrific ways -- a people that had never harmed America . American troops murdered Iraqi men , women and children using bombs -LRB- including chemical phosphorous bombs -RRB- , aerial rockets , shoulder fired rockets , artillery shrapnel , helicopter gunships , and plain old assault rifles and pistols . American shrapnel passing through the abdomens of children , for the cause of the American military-industrial complex . Tens of thousands of Iraqi men , women and children were killed by American troops . Literally millions of Iraqi families were driven from their homes , tearing the families apart . American troops , acting as secret police , for years , performed night-time roundups of anybody in Iraq the voiced opposition , labeling them as terrorists . American troops tortured thousands and killed in the Abu Gareb prison , and many photographs exist , and many photographs were destroyed . In America , we stand proud of our individual rights to bear arms . Yet American troops imprisoned and sometimes executed many innocent Iraqi men because they dared to keep a gun in their bedroom to defend their family . Compared to America , Gaddafi is not such a bad guy perhaps . And , of course , Abraham Lincoln made war against his own people who rebelled . He killed over 500,000 fellow Americans , whose bodies can be found today in mass graves scattered across eastern America . The UN should perhaps look at America for war crimes .

Speaking after meeting Sarkozy , Mahmoud Jebril , a member of the LNC , said France would unveil a `` global strategic plan '' to the European Union on Friday to try to resolve the crisis . `` The plan would be at a -LRB- European -RRB- level to save the Libyan people from the suffering and massacre being perpetrated against it and to safeguard the future and the country . '' Rebel representatives in Benghazi said France was the first country in the world to give them formal diplomatic recognition . A French diplomatic source said Paris ' decision was `` a political signal of encouragement '' and that it hoped the European Union would follow suit . '' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle sounded a cautious note . `` This will have to wait for consultations held by the EU and the Special Representative of the United Nations . Before we undertake such political steps , we must of course know who we 're dealing with . '' A Spanish government spokesman told Reuters Spain would join the rest of Europe in a common decision out of meetings today and tomorrow , while Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger said the talks with the LNC `` were very welcome .

ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called on Libyan authorities to grant the humanitarian agency access to western areas including the capital Tripoli so as to assess needs . He also reminded both Libyan forces and insurgents that under international humanitarian law it is prohibited to target civilians , medical facilities and ambulances . `` We have now a non-international armed conflict , or what you would call civil war , '' Kellenberger told a news conference . `` We see increasing numbers of wounded arriving at hospitals in the east and we are extremely worried . '' The ICRC , one of the few international aid agencies in Libya , has set up a base in rebel-held Benghazi in the east where it is helping to perform war surgery and supply hospitals . Kellenberger said he had no overall casualty figures for the country or reports on the western city of Zawiyah , which appeared to change hands twice during the day on Wednesday in a hard-fought battle . But he said that fighting had intensified and local doctors had seen a sharp rise in casualties , with at least 22 bodies and 40 wounded in Misrata after recent air strikes . Some 55 wounded were treated in Ajdabiyah hospital in the east this week . Top Libyan authorities whom he declined to identify had personally told him there was no need for outside help in the areas held by Libyan forces , according to Kellenberger , a former Swiss diplomat . `` We do n't know what the humanitarian needs are in areas controlled by Tripoli . I was told everything is under control , all hospitals are working perfectly , there is no need for external humanitarian assistance , '' he said . `` You can only assist people when you have access . Our first priority is to have access to areas controlled by Tripoli .

WASHINGTON | Thu Mar 10 , 2011 6:46 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As the Obama administration wrestles over what to do about Libya , the voices on Capitol Hill offer no consensus on military action . Influential senators John McCain , a Republican , and John Kerry , a Democrat , have kept up a drumbeat for U.S. military action such as a `` no-fly '' zone to aid the rebels fighting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . But other senior lawmakers , like Republicans Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , are warning against getting the United States into a Libyan war . The Senate 's top Republican , Mitch McConnell , has suggested possibly arming the Libyan rebels , but other leaders in Congress have been more vague . Analysts say Congress may be waiting for a clear steer from the commander in chief , President Obama . `` It seems very clear there is not a consensus about what to do , and that is natural . Any time you have a crisis like this you are going to look for leadership from the executive branch , '' said foreign policy analyst Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute think-tank in Washington . `` My guess is that Obama will not authorize a no-fly zone without clear support from Congress and allies , '' said Henry Nau , political science professor at George Washington University . Obama `` has not taken a clear lead in arguing for that with either Congress or NATO . '' Ros-Lehtinen , a foreign policy hawk and chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , told Reuters the situation in Libya was rapidly evolving . `` At this time , I do not believe it is in our national security interest for the U.S. to intervene militarily , '' she said . Although she is a big critic of Gaddafi , Ros-Lehtinen also called proposals to arm opposition forces in Libya misguided , saying the U.S. knew very little about them and this could have `` grave consequences for U.S. interests . '' Some of Obama 's Democrats , like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein , also say United States should avoid any military involvement in Libya . `` We 're in two other wars . There are problems in Iraq . There 's an expected major spring offensive in Afghanistan , we have problems with Pakistan ... It 's a civil war within the country -LRB- Libya -RRB- , '' Feinstein said outside the Senate . `` Even a no-fly zone would technically be an act of war , '' she said . Lugar , the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , says that any major military action to support anti-Gaddafi forces would require a vote of Congress . On Thursday , the top U.S. spy chief told lawmakers Gaddafi 's forces were likely to prevail in the long run against rebels fighting to end his 41-year rule . National Intelligence Director James Clapper 's assessment may lead to louder calls in Congress for Obama to take swift military action to help the rebels . Kerry , who has advocated taking out runways used by Gaddafi 's forces , told Reuters he feared Washington would look `` feckless '' down the road if it did not try to help the rebels . He and McCain have endorsed preparing a no-fly zone , in which the United States and its allies would stop Gaddafi 's aircraft from firing on the rebels . Some congressional leaders have issued cautious statements that condemn Gaddafi but do n't endorse or oppose military action for now . House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has stressed that any action that the U.S. takes must be in line with broader U.S. interests in the region . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the United Nations and the international community should be committed to `` examining all options - including a no-fly zone - that may be necessary to protect innocent civilians and ensure the democratic aspirations of the Libyan people are heard .

Help is not in sight , even as he strikes back with tanks , artillery and warplanes . Gaddafi is widely reviled in the Arab world , even by his fellow autocrats . Nor is he loved by the Western powers that had courted him for his oil until the revolt against him . Yet with the military momentum appearing to shift in his favor , the Libyan leader of 41 years may succeed where Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali failed , in clinging to power . His willingness to use extreme force , with no effective riposte from the outside world , could also set a dangerous example to other Arab rulers confronting disaffected populations . According to a somber assessment by U.S. President Barack Obama 's national intelligence chief , James Clapper , Gaddafi is `` in this for the long haul '' and is likely to prevail . Public calls are growing for some action to save rebels and civilians from the firepower of pro-Gaddafi forces , now regaining ground near Tripoli and along the eastern coast . Yet nothing has been done beyond sanctions in the form of an asset freeze and arms embargo , threatening prosecution for war crimes , and French-led moves to recognize a rebel national council . The rag-tag Libyan fighters battling Gaddafi 's military can not fathom what the world is waiting for , even as the leader 's son Saif al-Islam declares that they face a full-scale assault to crush their three-week-old uprising . `` I am disappointed as we have asked for air and sea blockades , '' Mustafa Abdel-Jalil , head of the opposition national council in Libya , told the BBC on Friday , saying that delaying action further `` might allow Gaddafi to regain control and remain in power against the will of the Libyan people . '' Yet there is no international consensus on robust action . Judging by Thursday 's meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- , the African Union and NATO , none will emerge soon . European Union leaders were meeting on Friday to discuss Libya . Many fear mission creep if , say , a no-fly zone were imposed . `` What happens if it is not the Libyan air force that is gaining ground , but their armor ... and heavy artillery ? '' asked Timur Goksel , a former U.N. peacekeeping adviser in Beirut . `` Then what do you do , attack those ? Because that 's not a no-fly zone , it 's war . It 's a very complicated decision . The Western countries have to think very hard , '' Goksel said . For all their anti-Gaddafi rhetoric , Western powers are wary of plunging into another conflict in a Muslim nation in the absence of any simple way to remove a leader bent on survival . The United States is hamstrung by its costly and contentious military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan . Russia and China , along with Arab nations such as Algeria and Syria , are queasy about any precedent for meddling in another country 's affairs . So it is hard to get the U.N. Security Council to authorize military action -- no-fly zones or sending military advisers or weapons to rebels are arguably acts of war -- and no nation or alliance is yet ready to step in without such approval . The International Crisis Group has argued instead for a ceasefire and negotiations to end a burgeoning Libyan civil war . `` Western calls for military intervention of one kind or another are perilous and potentially counter-productive . There are no quick or easy fixes , '' the conflict resolution group says . `` Insisting that Gaddafi step down will not make it happen . Imposing a no-fly zone , bombing airfields or arming the rebels could tilt the balance of power in the rebels ' favor , but is unlikely to swiftly bring down the regime . '' The African Union , rejecting any military intervention , plans to send five heads of state to Libya to seek a truce . The Arab League has suspended Libya 's membership . Saudi Arabia and its five partners in the GCC have voiced support for a no-fly zone and declared Gaddafi 's rule illegitimate . The Arab League was due to meet in Cairo on Saturday and officials said it would not let a delegation from Tripoli attend . But decisive action from the League would be a surprise . `` The Arab League has become an entirely emasculated body that is essentially capable of doing nothing except rhetoric and speeches , '' said Karim Makdisi , who teaches international relations at the American University of Beirut -LRB- AUB -RRB- . He said most Arab regimes remained intact despite the overthrow of leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and popular unrest against others . None of them wanted the Arab League to lead the way in intervening against the government of a member state . NATO is also skittish about proposals to crimp Gaddafi 's military with a no-fly zone . This would require evidence of war crimes against civilians , a clear legal basis and firm regional support , said its secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasumussen . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has signaled that her country will not go solo in imposing a no-fly zone on Libya . `` Absent international authorization , the United States acting alone would be stepping into a situation whose consequences are unforeseeable , '' she said on Thursday , belittling the effect of past no-fly zones in Iraq and Serbia . Gaddafi , like Iraq 's Saddam Hussein , would portray any Western intervention as a selfish , colonial venture -- rhetoric that for many Arabs is grounded in decades of bitter reality . `` What we fear most is this European and Western eagerness to take control of Libya 's oil , '' said Omar Nashabe , an editor at Beirut 's al-Akhbar newspaper , which is sympathetic to Hezbollah . Many Arabs feel outraged by Gaddafi 's bloody strikes against his foes , but might also mistrust Western action , especially if an air embargo produced unintended civilian casualties . `` There is no belief that U.S. intervention will be brief , in the interests of Arabs , or serve the interests of stability , '' said AUB 's Makdisi . Many Arabs would see it as oil-motivated or as a U.S. bid to get ahead of the curve after failing to respond adequately to the pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and Tunisia . `` The wider context is the abysmal failure of the Obama administration to have any coherent U.S. policy toward the Middle East , '' Makdisi said , citing its past support for Arab strongmen and its ill-starred Israeli-Palestinian peace drive .

But rebel fighters in Misrata , on the Mediterranean coast about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of the Libyan capital Tripoli , said they had stalled a ground attack on the city and seized some tanks from pro-Gaddafi units . `` The fighters have defeated Gaddafi 's forces from the southern and western side -LRB- of the city -RRB- , '' a resident , who gave his name only as Mohammed , told Reuters by telephone . `` The shelling on the city stopped and the rebels have captured some tanks . The battle is continuing on the eastern side , but it is not a heavy one . '' It was not possible to call Misrata later in the day . On Wednesday evening , the online news website Brnieq quoted a telecommunications official in Tripoli as saying Libyan authorities had ordered all mobile and land services cut . Earlier , residents and rebel fighters who spoke to Reuters said Gaddafi loyalists had begun to bombard the city at 7:00 a.m -LRB- 0500 GMT -RRB- with tanks , artillery and rockets , in what appeared to be preparation for an assault . But they said that ground forces had yet to enter Misrata and were still in the outskirts . Accounts of fighting in Misrata could not be verified because Libyan authorities have barred reporters from the city . Libyan officials had no immediate comment on reports of an attack . A doctor at Misrata hospital said 11 people had been killed and 20 wounded in the fighting . He said the wounded were being brought to hospital in private cars because ambulance drivers were afraid of being hit by shells . `` We have enough medicine but we are short on staff , '' said the doctor , who gave his name as Muftah . A rebel fighter in Misrata , who did not give his name , said the city would make a stand . `` They are trying to enter the city . I do not think they will be able to do it , at least not today , '' he said . The assault on Misrata , Libya 's third-biggest city with a population of about 300,000 , coincides with a rapid advance by Gaddafi 's forces on rebel strongholds in eastern Libya . Gaddafi , in power since a military coup in 1969 , lost control of large swathes of Libya in a revolt last month , but since then his security forces have fought back . State television made an appeal to the people of Misrata to support the security forces and turn their back on the rebels . `` The armed forces are from you and for you , '' the appeal said . `` Avoid strife ...

Libya action 1 of 2 . United Nations Security Council diplomats vote on a resolution during a meeting on Libya at U.N. headquarters in New York February 26 , 2011 . UNITED NATIONS | Wed Mar 16 , 2011 7:06 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States , France and Britain on Wednesday urged the U.N. Security Council to take swift action on a proposed no-fly zone over Libya , as Washington suggested it might have decided to back the plan . The Security Council met through the day behind closed doors to discuss a draft resolution authorizing a no-fly zone to halt Libyan government air strikes on rebels . But some council members , including veto powers Russia and China , are either undecided or have doubts . British , French and Lebanese envoys distributed the draft on Tuesday after the Arab League called on the council to approve a no-fly zone in Libya . Libya 's deputy U.N. envoy Ibrahim Dabbashi , whose denunciation of leader Muammar Gaddafi last month inspired dozens of similar defections by Tripoli 's diplomats worldwide , said there was no time for delays as Gaddafi 's forces continue to pummel rebel forces in the east . `` The international community has to act within the next 10 hours , '' said Dabbashi . In remarks that suggested a reluctant Washington had now agreed to support the idea of a no-fly zone , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was hopeful the council would take a vote on a Libya resolution no later than Thursday . `` We are moving as rapidly as we can in New York to see whether we can get additional authorization for the international community to look at a broad range of actions , not just a no-fly zone but other actions as well , '' Clinton told reporters in Cairo . `` We wo n't know until there is an actual vote . We 're hoping that will be no later than tomorrow , '' she said . Clinton told CBS television that the Arab League call for a no-fly zone had caused a `` sea change '' in thinking . `` For the Arab League to call for military action to protect civilians in Libya , against a member of the Arab League , was an extraordinary statement of leadership and real conviction , '' she said . `` That has changed the thinking of a lot of people . '' Washington had reacted cautiously to the calls for a no-fly zone over Libya , with some officials concerned it could be militarily ineffective or politically damaging . It has insisted Arab nations actively participate in any such zone over Libya . French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters he had formally submitted the draft to the U.N. secretariat with a view to putting it to a vote on Thursday . He said council members could propose final amendments overnight . Diplomats said Araud was trying to force a vote . French President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote in a letter to the council that it was `` high time for the international community ... to pull together ... and respond without delay to the urgent appeal of the League of Arab States . '' `` Together , we can save the martyred people of Libya , '' he said . `` It is now a matter of days , if not hours . The worst would be that the appeal of the -LRB- Arab League -RRB- and the Security Council decisions be overruled by the force of arms . '' Lebanese Ambassador Nawaf Salam urged the council to act before it was too late for a no-fly zone to have any impact . He cited a prediction by Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam that the rebels would be defeated within two days . `` It is our hope that the Security Council will impose a no-fly zone quickly and prove him wrong , '' he said . Salam said one concern raised by Germany and others -- the apparent clash between the Arab League 's call for a no-fly zone and its opposition to foreign military intervention -- was not a contradiction . He said Arab nations would help enforce any no-fly zone authorized by the council . `` There will be a significant Arab participation , '' he said . Clinton told CBS the Arabs should play a prominent role . `` The Arab League statement , their very courageous stance , suggests that they know that they have to step up and lead and participate in any action that would be internationally authorized , '' she said . The draft resolution , obtained by Reuters , says the council `` decides to establish a ban on all flights in the airspace of -LRB- Libya -RRB- in order to help protect civilians . '' It authorizes member states to `` take all necessary measures to enforce compliance '' and says countries implementing the ban would be doing so in cooperation with the Arab League and in coordination with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . The draft also provides for expanding sanctions already slapped by the U.N. council on Libyan leaders on February 26 -- including asset freezes , travel bans and an arms embargo -- to cover all assets abroad of the Gaddafi government .

A U.S. National Security official said Gaddafi 's forces were continuing to advance toward the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi , despite a ceasefire announcement by the Libyan government earlier in the day . In Benghazi , rebels said they feared an attack by Gaddafi 's forces , while in the western rebel-held city Misrata , residents said they had faced a day of heavy bombing . `` All attacks against civilians must stop , '' Obama said , a day after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing international military intervention to protect civilians in Libya . Underlining a commitment to provide protection to people across the country -- and not just in the rebel-held east -- Obama also specifically called on Gaddafi 's forces to pull back from the western cities of Zawiyah and Misrata , as well as the eastern town of Ajdabiya : `` Gaddafi must stop his troops from advancing on Benghazi , pull them back from Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zawiyah , and establish water , electricity and gas supplies to all areas . Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya ... `` Let me be clear , these terms are not negotiable ... If Gaddafi does not comply ... the resolution will be enforced through military action . '' His comments were echoed in a statement that Paris issued on behalf of the United States , Britain , France and Arab states . GADDAFI TROOPS ADVANCING , OFFICIAL SAYS In Washington , a national security official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the troop movements by Gaddafi 's forces toward Benghazi were `` purposeful '' . The assessment was based on official reporting reaching U.S. national security agencies in Washington , he said . Asked by CNN whether Gaddafi was in violation of the U.N. resolution , the U.S. envoy to the United Nations , Susan Rice , said : `` Yes , he is . '' In Tripoli the government said there had been no bombing since it announced the ceasefire . `` We have had no bombardment of any kind since the ceasefire was declared , '' Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told journalists when asked about reports of continued government operations in Misrata and other parts of the country . Kaim said Libya was asking China , Germany , Malta and Turkey to send observers to monitor its adherence to the ceasefire . A doctor in Misrata contacted by phone in the evening said there had been heavy bombing through the day . `` Now they are on the outskirts of the city and I can still hear bombing from time to time , '' he said . Rebels in Benghazi dismissed Gaddafi 's ceasefire declaration as a ruse . `` He is lying . His troops are advancing . We do n't believe what Gaddafi says , '' said Mohammed Ishmael al-Tajouri , from the rebel coalition in Benghazi . `` When he comes to Benghazi he will be fighting . There is no negotiating with Gaddafi . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said everything was ready to launch military strikes in Libya . France and Britain have both been strong advocates of military action . After embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the United States had insisted it would participate in rather than lead any military action . Obama said the United States would not deploy ground troops in Libya . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It 's their backyard , not ours , and the US has no compelling reason to get involved in a Libyan civil war . U.S. Undersecretary of State William Burns said he was concerned Gaddafi , dubbed the ` mad dog of the Middle East ' by president Ronald Reagan in 1986 , could `` return to terrorism and violent extremism '' and create turmoil in the region .

But it is not without risks . Thursday 's U.N. Security Council vote backing military action in Libya offers intervening powers a very broad mandate , by authorizing `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . It is unclear how far the allies want to go , notably in view of Gaddafi 's initial response of offering a ceasefire . But it is clear their firepower gives them many possibilities . Military analysts said the resolution could mean a campaign extending beyond simply preventing government planes operating in a no-fly zone around Benghazi and other rebel-held areas and might be expected to include strikes against air bases , missile sites , command centers , heavy artillery units and tanks . They said a coalition led by Britain and France and backed by the United States and Arab countries would be able to deploy formidable air capabilities -- including French Mirage 2000 and Rafale fighters , British Typhoon and Tornado strike aircraft and U.S. F-22s -- against Gaddafi 's fairly ragged resources . `` The terms of the resolution are very wide-ranging , '' said Shashank Joshi at London 's Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- , suggesting it could lead to overthrowing Gaddafi . `` Over time we may not just see bombing of units close to Benghazi ; we may see powers saying we are authorized to remove this threat . '' The air armada would be backed by airborne early-warning and tanker aircraft and British Nimrod spy planes , against a Libyan air force that may be able to field as few as 40 of its notional combat strength of 200-plus aircraft , said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies . Analysts said the attackers could use a broad range of bases across southern Europe , including in Italy , British bases in Cyprus and Gibraltar and French bases in Corsica and southern France -- as well as , potentially , bases in Gulf states . A French official said the operation could also involve missiles fired from warships in the Mediterranean . Barak Seener , a Middle East expert at RUSI said the Libyan armed forces would be able to put up little contest : `` I would give it a month , '' he said . `` It will be striking targets of the regime and it will be rapidly eroding the regime 's command and control . I do n't see this as a time-consuming exercise . '' Seener said Western forces , sticking to U.N. instructions not to invade , would seek to turn the war decisively against Gaddafi by aiding the nearly defeated rebels . They would supply them with communication equipment , anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems and also send special forces to train their troops . `` And they will use the no-fly zone to offer the opposition intelligence on the regime 's movements and force concentrations , '' he said , painting a picture of a decisive intervention on the hitherto losing side in Libya 's civil war . Seener said that as well as the Rafale , a multi-purpose strike aircraft , France could use the Super Etendard , a carrier-borne strike fighter supported by VC-10 and C-135 FR refueling tankers and AWACS reconnaissance aircraft . He said France would have about 30 carrier-based aircraft available , while the United State had indicated it would only use land-based aircraft . These may come from Italy . French aircraft could also fly out of land bases in mainland France and Corsica and from Italy , 500-1 ,400 km from Tripoli . Britain , meanwhile would employ Tornado GR4s , Typhoons and air-to-air refueling and surveillance aircraft , while Canada is sending six CF-18 Hornets . Saudi Arabia , which has Tornados , F-15s and Typhoons , and other Arabs states -- the UAE and Qatar -- would probably provide a token number of aircraft , he said . `` The first ground strikes will be carried out by Rafales , Mirage 2000Ds and Tornado GR4s , firing precision weapons -- laser-guided bombs , GPS guided -LRB- A2SM -RRB- and Scalp or Storm Shadow missiles , '' he said . `` The bombers will be escorted by fighters to protect them and go after any Libyan planes sent to intercept . '' Joshi said that because the rebels lacked the power to topple Gaddafi militarily the allies ' strategy would have to be based on first removing his ability to threaten Benghazi , then a combination of political and military pressure . `` The hope will be that there will either be a coup or disintegration of the regime from the top , '' he said . While analysts forecast that first strikes against Gaddafi could be launched in the next day or two -- possibly as early as Saturday , when Arab and Western leaders are scheduled to meet in Paris -- some analysts cautioned it could be too late to avoid a messy partition of the country . `` It looks like Gaddafi will stay in power in Tripoli for some time to come and a form of stalemate will emerge , bringing a partition between the east and west , '' said Henry Wilkinson of the Janusian Security Consultants . Joshi said it was hard to predict how long the campaign would last , but noted that the NATO operation in Kosovo in 1999 , which was forecast to take weeks , had dragged on for months . `` There 's no guarantee , '' he said . `` Gaddafi could pull back to Sirte and make clear he 's no longer threatening Benghazi and put the coalition in a position of having to decide whether to bomb him there , which could look like a provocative act . `` So it could result in stalemate that could go on for months . And the longer it goes on the more Arab public opinion will go against it , because you will see creeping civilian casualties , and the more you will see this coalition , which is a very artificial thing , slowly fracture . '' Analysts also pointed to the potential costs of a long drawn out campaign , at a time of economic crisis and austerity . While an initial air campaign could be launched with `` tens of aircraft , '' Joshi said , it was eventually likely to have to involve hundreds and cost in excess of $ 100 million a week .

French planes fired the first shots in what is the biggest international military intervention in the Arab world since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , destroying tanks and armored vehicles in the region of the rebels ' eastern stronghold , Benghazi . Hours later , U.S. and British warships and submarines launched 110 Tomahawk missiles against air defenses around the capital Tripoli and the western city of Misrata , which has been besieged by Gaddafi 's forces , U.S. military officials said . They said U.S. forces and planes were working with Britain , France , Canada and Italy in operation `` Odyssey Dawn '' . Gaddafi called it `` colonial , crusader '' aggression . `` It is now necessary to open the stores and arm all the masses with all types of weapons to defend the independence , unity and honor of Libya , '' he said in an audio message broadcast on state television hours after the strikes began . State television said the `` crusader enemy '' hit civilian areas of Tripoli and fuel storage tanks that supplied Misrata . Residents in Misrata said air strikes had targeted a military airbase where Gaddafi loyalists were based . Several Tripoli residents said they heard an explosion near the eastern Tajoura district . `` I heard an explosion . I saw a flash , it was a very strong explosion , '' said one . In Benghazi , where earlier on Saturday rebels said they had beaten back an advance by Gaddafi 's troops , residents welcomed the military intervention but were also apprehensive . `` We think this will end Gaddafi 's rule . Libyans will never forget France 's stand with them . If it were n't for them , then Benghazi would have been overrun tonight , '' said Iyad Ali , 37 . `` We salute , France , Britain , the United States and the Arab countries for standing with Libya . But we think Gaddafi will take out his anger on civilians . So the West has to hit him hard , '' said Khalid al-Ghurfaly , a civil servant , 38 . Earlier on Saturday , leaders meeting in Paris announced the start of military intervention after Gaddafi 's troops pushed into the outskirts of Benghazi in spite of a U.N. resolution passed on Thursday calling for an end to attacks on civilians . `` Those taking part agreed to put in place all necessary means , especially military , to enforce the decisions of the United Nations Security Council , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the meeting of Western and Arab leaders . `` Colonel Gaddafi has made this happen , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters after the meeting . `` We can not allow the slaughter of civilians to continue . '' Some analysts have questioned the strategy for the military intervention , fearing western forces might be sucked into a long civil war despite a U.S. insistence -- repeated on Saturday -- that it has no plans to send ground troops into Libya . Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper suggested that outside powers hoped their intervention would be enough to turn the tide against Gaddafi and allow Libyans to force him out . `` It is our belief that if Mr. Gaddafi loses the capacity to enforce his will through vastly superior armed forces , he simply will not be able to sustain his grip on the country . '' A U.S. military slide showed some 25 coalition ships , including three U.S. submarines armed with Tomahawk missiles , are stationed in the Mediterranean . The Libyan government has blamed rebels , who it says belong to al Qaeda , for breaking a ceasefire it announced on Friday . In Tripoli , several thousand people gathered at the Bab al-Aziziyah palace , Gaddafi 's compound that was bombed by U.S. warplanes in 1986 , to show their support . `` There are 5,000 tribesmen that are preparing to come here to fight with our leader . They better not try to attack our country , '' said farmer Mahmoud el-Mansouri . `` We will open up Libya 's deserts and allow Africans to flood to Europe to blow themselves up as suicide bombers . '' U.S. SAYS NOT LEADING INTERVENTION France and Britain have taken a lead role in pushing for international intervention in Libya and the United States -- after embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- has been at pains to stress it is supporting , not leading , the operation . In announcing the missile strikes , which came eight years to the day after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq , Obama said the effort was intended to protect the Libyan people . `` Today I authorized the armed forces of the United States to begin a limited action in Libya in support of an international effort to protect Libyan civilians , '' Obama told reporters in Brasilia , where he had begun a five-day tour of Latin America . He said U.S. troops were acting in support of allies , who would lead the enforcement of a no-fly zone to stop Gaddafi 's attacks on rebels . `` As I said yesterday , we will not , I repeat , we will not deploy any U.S. troops on the ground , '' Obama said . But despite Washington 's determination to stress the limits of its role , Vice Admiral Bill Gortney , director of the U.S. military 's Joint Staff , said the missile strikes were only the first phase of a multiphase action . Many analysts do not think Western powers would be satisfied with a de facto partition which left the rebels in control in the east and Gaddafi running a rump state in the west . One participant at the Paris meeting said that Clinton and others had stressed Libya should not be split in two . And Obama on Friday specifically called on Gaddafi 's forces to pull back from the western cities of Zawiyah and Misrata as well from the east . But security analysts have questioned what western powers will do if Gaddafi digs in . `` It 's going to be far less straightforward if Gaddafi starts to move troops into the cities which is what he has been trying to do for the past 24 hours , '' said Marko Papic at the STRATFOR global intelligence group . `` Once he does that it becomes a little bit more of an urban combat environment and at that point it 's going to be difficult to use air power from 15,000 feet to neutralize that . '' Earlier on Saturday hundreds of cars full of refugees fled Benghazi toward the Egyptian border after the city came under a bombardment overnight . One family of 13 women from a grandmother to small children , rested at a roadside hotel . `` I 'm here because when the bombing started last night my children were vomiting from fear , '' said one of them , a doctor . `` All I want to do is get my family to a safe place and then get back to Benghazi to help . My husband is still there . '' Those who remained set up make-shift barricades with furniture , benches , road signs and even a barbecue in one case at intervals along main streets . Each barricade was manned by half a dozen rebels , but only about half of those were armed . In the besieged western city of Misrata , residents said government forces shelled the rebel town again early on Saturday , while water supplies had been cut off for a third day . `` I am telling you , we are scared and we are alone '' , a Misrata resident , called Saadoun , told Reuters by telephone . -LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Abbas and Angus MacSwan in Benghazi , Tom Perry in Cairo , Maria Golovnina and Michael Georgy in Tripoli , Hamid Ould Ahmed and Christian Lowe in Algiers ; John Irish and Elizabeth Pineau in Paris , Missy Ryan in Washington , Writing by Myra MacDonald ; Editing by Jon Boyle -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

With reason , sane , and decidedly , but in way to prevent war or destruction with war action as much as possible .

U.S. military officials said Saturday 's strikes had halted an advance by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern rebel stronghold Benghazi and hit his air defenses , allowing western powers to send in planes to impose a no-fly zone . But the day-old U.N.-mandated military intervention to force Gaddafi 's troops to end attacks on civilians hit a diplomatic setback when the Arab League chief questioned the bombardment . `` What is happening in Libya differs from the aim of imposing a no-fly zone , and what we want is the protection of civilians and not the bombardment of more civilians , '' Egypt 's state news agency quoted Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa as saying . Gaddafi himself said the air strikes amounted to terrorism and vowed to fight to the death , although at 9 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB- on Sunday an armed forces spokesman said the army was ordering all troops to cease fire immediately . The United States and Britain , who along with France , Italy and Canada have joined operation `` Odyssey Dawn , '' dismissed the ceasefire announcement , arguing that Gaddafi 's government had promised and then broken a ceasefire on Friday . In central Benghazi , sporadic explosions and heavy firing could be heard in the streets late in the evening . A Reuters witness said the firing lasted about 40 minutes . Residents had said they feared some of Gaddafi 's troops could try to force their way into the city , where they would be surrounded by civilians and protected from attacks from the air . Outside Benghazi , the advance by Gaddafi 's troops was stopped in its tracks , with smoldering , shattered tanks and troop carriers littering the main road . The charred bodies of at least 14 government soldiers lay scattered in the desert . However , government tanks did move into Misrata , the last rebel-held city in western Libya , seeking the shelter of built-up areas after a base used by Gaddafi 's forces outside was hit by Western air strikes , residents said . Abdelbasset , a spokesman for the rebels in Misrata , told Reuters : `` There is fighting between the rebels and Gaddafi 's forces . Their tanks are in the center of Misrata ... There are so many casualties we can not count them . '' A Libyan government health official said 64 people had been killed in the Western bombardment overnight from Saturday to Sunday , but it was impossible to verify the report . The Arab League 's Moussa called for an emergency meeting of the group of 22 states to discuss Libya . He requested a report into the bombardment , which he said had `` led to the deaths and injuries of many Libyan civilians . '' Arab backing for a no-fly zone provided crucial underpinning for the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution last week that paved the way for Western action to stop Gaddafi killing civilians as he fights an uprising against his rule . The intervention is the biggest against an Arab country since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Withdrawal of Arab support would make it much harder to pursue what some defense analysts say could in any case be a difficult , open-ended campaign with an uncertain outcome . Britain and the United States rebuffed Moussa 's comments . A senior U.S. official said a U.N. resolution endorsed by Arab states covered `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , `` which we made very clear includes , but goes beyond , a no-fly zone . '' The safe enforcement of the no-fly zone required the targeting of Libya 's air defense capabilities , a British Foreign Ministry spokesman said . A spokesman for the rebel movement criticized Moussa 's comments , telling Al Jazeera that more than 8,000 Libyans aligned with the rebel movement had been killed . `` Today , when the secretary-general spoke , I was surprised , '' Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said . `` What is the mechanism that stops the extermination of the people in Libya , what is the mechanism , Mr Secretary-General ? If the protection of civilians is not a humanitarian obligation , what is the mechanism that you propose to us ? '' The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said the no-fly zone was now in place . But he told CBS television the endgame of military action was `` very uncertain '' and acknowledged it could end in a stalemate with Gaddafi . Mullen said he had seen no reports of civilian casualties from the Western strikes . But Russia said there had been such casualties and called on Britain , France and the United States to halt the `` non-selective use of force . '' Libyan state television showed footage from an unidentified hospital of what it called victims of the `` colonial enemy . '' Ten bodies were wrapped up in white and blue bed sheets , and several people were wounded , one of them badly , the television said . The Libyan government has denied breaking a ceasefire that it announced on Friday , blaming rebels who it says are members of al Qaeda . The armed forces spokesman announced a new ceasefire on Sunday , saying that `` the Libyan armed forces ... have issued a command to all military units to safeguard an immediate ceasefire from 9 p.m. -LRB- 1900 GMT -RRB- this evening . '' Both before and after he spoke , heavy anti-aircraft gunfire boomed above central Tripoli . A senior military official said the United States expected to conduct more strikes on Libya . `` This is an ongoing military operation . I fully expect more strikes , '' he said . Britain said it was taking part in a second night of coordinated strikes and had once more launched Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine in the Mediterranean . Italy said it also had planes in the air . The United States , after embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , has been reluctant to take the lead in the military operation , keen to leave this to France and Britain while also assembling a large coalition to support it . French planes fired the first shots of the intervention on Saturday , destroying tanks and armored vehicles near Benghazi . France sent an aircraft carrier toward Libya and its planes were over the country again on Sunday , defense officials said . Britain said its planes had targeted Libya 's air defenses , mainly around the capital Tripoli . U.S. and British warships and submarines launched 110 Tomahawk missiles on Saturday night and Sunday morning against air defenses around Tripoli and Misrata , U.S. officials said . Aircraft from other countries , including Qatar , were also moving toward Libya to participate in the operation , Mullen said . -LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Abbes and Angus MacSwan in Benghazi , Maria Golovnina and Michael Georgy in Tripoli , Hamid Ould Ahmed and Christian Lowe in Algiers ; Tom Perry in Cairo , John Irish and Elizabeth Pineau in Paris , Missy Ryan in Washington , Matt Spetalnick in Rio de Janeiro ; Writing by Myra Macdonald ; Editing by Kevin Liffey -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . And the goal is to do what ? Change the government -- the traditional purpose of WAR . The excuse `` to protect civilians '' is a novel one . I 'll give the imperial powers credit for that . My guess is civilians will get killed and a civil war prolonged . But why are Europe and the US so anxious to overturn Gadhafi after more than 40 years ? And were they behind the rebellion to begin with ? That was the case in Afghanistan in 1978 , when Carter armed and financed the rebellion that led to Russian intervention and a million deaths . I notice that when Israeli aircraft and missiles are used against civilians in Lebanon or Gaza , I do n't see the West threatening anything at all -- no embargo , nothing to prevent Israel from flying and bombing , and surely no attack on tanks or armored vehicles used to kill civilians . More than 20,000 civilians in many such attacks going back to 1978 . The definition of a bully is `` one who uses strength or power to intimidate or harm others . '' Looks like the West , Gadhafi , and Israel have a lot in common . As in every other tragedy and including this one , those who have had their homes and families destroyed do not care about geopolitical opinions . Anonymous , what on earth are you talking about ? This is a secular rebellion against a secular government ! Not everything in the Middle East is about religion , you fearmonger . What they cheered is irrelevant ; the article did n't say , so why are you assuming that it was `` Allah Akbar '' -LRB- No different than a Christian saying `` Thank God ! '' , for your information -RRB- ? I 'm sick of these Muslim-Haters commenting on news articles , spreading their irrational paranoia to others like the disease it is . Bush is n't president anymore . The politics of fear are over ! Get over it ; al Qaida has \\* NOTHING \\* to do with the popular rebellion in Libya , so just drop it , hatemonger ! As for whether a war is good or bad , the issue is that this was already a war well before the West got involved . It was just a monstrously unfair war , with the side of the despot being armed with sophisticate weapons of war that the rebelling patriots just could n't stand against . The point of establishing the no-fly zone is so that the people of Libya can fight this issue out for themselves , without one side simply wiping out the other summarily . The forces of Gadhafi were already destroying the homes of innocent civilians , and the Western Coalition is only attacking military targets , exclusively . War is a horrible thing when it happens , but it is part of human nature , and at times when a people are dealing with a fascist despot that will not let go of power through peaceful\\/diplomatic means , then war is what is left . I hate war more than most people , but people have to think ; if England came up with a powerful weapon that was wiping out hundreds of American Rebel Troops during the US War of Independence and they could do nothing to stand against it , would n't you have wanted Spain or some other big global power at the time to step in and stop that mega-weapon from being used , so that the war did n't turn into a genocide ?

After a six-hour debate , parliament voted overwhelmingly to support Cameron 's decision to send British planes and ships to help enforce a no-fly zone to stop attacks on civilians by the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . The vote was 557-13 , although some lawmakers voiced fears of getting dragged deeper into the Libyan conflict and others questioned why Britain had chosen to intervene in Libya but not in other crisis-hit countries . Hanging heavy over the debate was the shadow of Iraq , where 179 British soldiers were killed in a long-running conflict after former Prime Minister Tony Blair backed then U.S. President George W. Bush 's decision to invade in March 2003 . `` This is different to Iraq . This is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' Cameron said . `` This is about protecting people and giving the Libyan people a chance to shape their own destiny , '' he said . Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Libya operation would be funded from a Treasury reserve and not from the defense budget , which faces a real-terms cut of 8 percent over the next four years as part of efforts to curb a big budget deficit . In a debate almost exactly eight years ago , the British parliament gave Blair a green light to wage war on Iraq despite a massive revolt within his own party . The 10-month-old Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government has stressed that the Libya situation is very different from the Iraq war , which clouded Blair 's premiership . Unlike the Iraq invasion , the Libya no-fly zone has been authorised by the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council resolution expressly bars occupation . Labor leader Ed Miliband supported Cameron , saying : `` We have seen with our own eyes what the Libyan regime is capable of . We 've seen guns being turned on unarmed demonstrators . '' But some MPs , particularly left-wing Labor members , voiced doubts about what Britain was getting into . `` I 'm far from convinced that the public are behind this , '' Labor legislator Jeremy Corbyn said . `` They are very concerned about where it leads to because they 've been through the miserable experience of Iraq and they have deep concerns additionally about Afghanistan , '' he said . Britain has 10,000 troops fighting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan . `` We should n't be in there , we 've got enough on our plate in Afghanistan , '' said Neil Wozencroft , a 35-year-old pipe fitter , told Reuters when asked about the Libya campaign . `` It 's a civil war and we should n't get involved , plus there are other atrocities in the world -- the Congo and Zimbabwe . We ca n't be the world 's peacekeepers . '' Conservative MP Edward Leigh called for a rethink of last year 's British defense review which he said had been a `` disaster . '' The review has paved the way for sharp cuts in armed forces ' equipment and personnel . Cameron said there was no action without risk . `` But ... we have to weigh the risks of inaction ... the consequences for Europe of a failed pariah state on its southern border . All of these , in my view , are simply too great to ignore , '' he said .

Rebels who began a revolt against Muammar Gaddafi a month ago have so far done little to capitalize on a two-day bombardment that halted an advance by government forces on their Benghazi stronghold and targeted Libya 's air defences . But Washington , wary of being sucked into another war after long campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan , has ruled out specific action to overthrow Gaddafi , though France said on Monday it hoped the Libyan government would collapse from within . `` My sense is that -- that unless something unusual or unexpected happens , we may see a decline in the frequency of attacks , '' General Carter Ham , who is leading U.S. forces in the Libyan operation , told reporters in Washington . He added , however , that `` we possess the capability to bring overwhelming combat power to bear , as we have done in the initial stages of this , where it 's been required . '' Libyan state television reported that several sites in the capital Tripoli had been subject to new attacks by what it called the `` crusader enemy '' on Monday . Reuters reporters heard two big explosions followed by anti-aircraft fire in Tripoli on Monday evening . The United States has run into some criticism for the intensity of the firepower used on Libya , which included more than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired on Saturday to take out Libya 's air defences and allow Western planes to patrol the skies . Although a U.N. resolution authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , Arab League chief Amr Moussa has questioned the methods used , while Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin compared the air campaign to `` medieval crusades . '' President Barack Obama said the United States , which has been joined by Britain , France , Canada and Italy among others in the air campaign , planned to transfer the lead military role shortly . Britain and France led calls for the intervention . `` We anticipate this transition to take place in a matter of days and not in a matter of weeks , '' Obama told a news conference during a visit to Chile . Libyan rebels have welcomed the air strikes and at the frontline along the coast from Benghazi have cheered warplanes as they roar overhead . Rebel headquarters also say they are coordinating with the Western powers launching air strikes . But there was little sign at the vanguard of battle in east Libya that this communication extended to forward rebel units . Western powers say they are not providing close air support to rebels or seeking to destroy Gaddafi 's army , but rather only protecting civilians , as their U.N. mandate allows , leaving disorganised rebel fighters struggling to make headway . `` If we do n't get more help from the West , Gaddafi 's forces will eat us alive , '' rebel fighter Nouh Musmari told Reuters . Leaders of the rebel movement in Benghazi have admitted their forces need more training . In the past , they also complained their over-enthusiastic fighters were too quick to race ahead , only to be driven back by Gaddafi 's army . Gaddafi 's forces have also tried to push into cities where they would be less vulnerable to attack from the air , while in the capital Tripoli people have rallied to support their leader . Security analysts say they are unclear what will happen if the Libyan leader digs in , especially since Western powers have made clear they would be unwilling to see Libya partitioned between a rebel-held east and Gaddafi-controlled west . `` Libya will not be a cakewalk , '' said Glen Howard , president of the Jamestown Foundation think tank . He added that the conflict 's current phase was reminiscent of the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 , which failed to meet expectations it would bring down Slobodan Milosevic within days . `` There is still a real risk of a protracted stalemate , with neither side wanting to negotiate . So the endgame remains very unclear , '' said Jeremy Binnie , a senior analyst with IHS Jane 's . In an appearance on Libyan television on Sunday , Gaddafi promised his enemies a `` long war . '' Officials in Tripoli said earlier that one missile in the second wave of attacks , which they said was intended to kill Gaddafi , had destroyed a building in his fortified compound , heavily bombed in 1986 by the Reagan administration . `` It was a barbaric bombing , '' said government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim , showing pieces of shrapnel that he said came from the missile . `` This contradicts American and Western -LRB- statements -RRB- ... that it is not their target to attack this place . '' A Libyan government spokesman also said that foreign attacks had killed many people by bombing ports and Sirte airport . `` You saw that place -LRB- Sirte airport -RRB- , '' Mussa Ibrahim told a news conference . `` It 's a civilian airport . It was bombarded and many people were killed . Harbours were also bombarded . '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said there were no plans to target Gaddafi . `` The U.N. resolution is limited in its scope , it explicitly does not provide legal authority for action to bring about Gaddafi 's removal from power by military means , '' Cameron told parliament . `` We will help fulfil the U.N. Security Council -LRB- resolution -RRB- , it is for the Libyan people to determine their government and their destiny , but our view is clear , there is no decent future for Libya with Colonel Gaddafi remaining in power . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said he hoped Libyans themselves would topple Gaddafi : `` When will the regime collapse ? It is quite possible that , given the weakness of the regime , it will break up from within . '' Gaddafi 's government announced a cease-fire on Sunday but this was dismissed by the United States and Britain , who said an earlier cease-fire pledge had been broken . The government accused the rebels of breaking the cease-fire . In Misrata , the only major rebel-held city in the west , residents said they had again come under attack on Monday . `` The people of Misrata went into the streets and to the -LRB- city -RRB- center , unarmed , in an attempt to stop Gaddafi 's forces entering the city , '' a resident told Reuters by telephone . `` When they gathered in the center the Gaddafi forces started shooting at them with artillery and guns . They committed a massacre . The hospital told us at least nine people were killed , '' said the resident , who gave his name as Saadoun . The report could not be independently verified because Libyan authorities prevented reporters from reaching Misrata . Residents said water supplies had been cut off and government troops had encircled the city . -LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Abbas and Angus MacSwan in Benghazi , Maria Golovnina and Michael Georgy in Tripoli , Hamid Ould Ahmed and Christian Lowe in Algiers ; Tom Perry in Cairo , John Irish in Paris , Missy Ryan in Washington , Matt Spetalnick in Rio de Janeiro ; Writing by Myra MacDonald ; Editing by Kevin Liffey -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The ComRes\\/ITN poll found that 43 percent disagreed with the action and 22 percent were unsure . Just under half of those surveyed felt military action was an unnecessary risk for Britain to take . Haunted by the experience of the recent Iraq war and continued losses in Afghanistan , Britons told Reuters they were wary of getting dragged into another lengthy foreign conflict at a time of belt-tightening at home . `` We should n't be in there , we 've got enough on our plate in Afghanistan , '' said Neil Wozencroft , a 35-year-old pipe fitter . `` It 's a civil war and we should n't get involved , plus there are other atrocities in the world -- the Congo and Mugabe in Zimbabwe . We ca n't be the world 's peacekeepers . '' Both Britain and France -- who led efforts on a no-fly zone in Libya -- are having to introduce austerity measures to tackle large budget deficits , while at the same time people are having to cope with rising food and fuel prices . `` Is it really worth it ? I ask myself , '' said widow Roymonde Urien in Paris , concerned the air strikes might lead to a flood of immigrants from Libya . All those Londoners quizzed by Reuters agreed they would like to see Gaddafi removed , but not through bombing .

Air strikes aimed at halting ethnic violence had only limited effect in achieving their goals in Bosnia and Kosovo until backed with the threat of effective ground action or at least the deployment of well-armed peacekeepers . In Afghanistan , an air campaign and special forces support was enough to oust the Taliban from power after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks -- but that war is far from over a decade on with thousands of NATO troops battling an ongoing insurgency . In Iraq , more than a decade of sanctions , a no-fly zone and repeated bouts of air strikes that followed the end of the 1991 war helped Kurdish regions remain largely free from Saddam Hussein but otherwise allowed him to remain in power . A change in western policy and overwhelming military force swiftly ended his rule in 2003 , but that proved the beginning of a bloody civil war and protracted U.S.-led military intervention is only just drawing to a close . The speed with which Britain , the United States and France have found themselves effectively at war in Libya at a time when much attention was focused on Japan 's earthquake has meant there was little of the public debate that preceded the 2003 Iraq war . `` There 's obviously the issue of timing -- that leaving things any longer would have allowed Gaddafi to produce a bloodbath , '' said Anthony Skinner , associate director of political risk consultancy Maplecroft . `` But it 's still far from a foregone conclusion that this will work . Gaddafi obviously has a vested interest in dragging things out in the hope that he will survive . In the long run , stopping him might require the deployment of ground troops and there seems very little appetite for that and resources are very thin . '' The United Nations resolution that ushered in action to protect civilians specifically ruled out a foreign occupation but endorsed `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . Perhaps deliberately , that leaves many options including limited ground intervention in support of rebels already recognized by France as the legitimate government of Libya . The question , analysts say , is how much political will is really there -- and what they want to achieve with it . `` The long-term goal , unspoken but well understood , is regime change , '' wrote George Friedman , head of political risk consultancy Stratfor . `` It should be remembered that in Iraq and Afghanistan ... regime change was merely the opening act . It is possible that the coalition partners have n't decided on the strategy yet , or may not be in agreement . '' France and Britain have both occasionally intervened in African civil wars in the past decade -- such as in Sierra Leone in 2001 -- but on the side of governments . Backing rebels against a strong central authority is a different matter -- likely requiring more outside intervention should Gaddafi 's rule crumble or collapse . `` Once it looks possible to force a political process , the international community will need to back a diplomatic engagement , '' said senior policy fellow Daniel Korski at the European Council on Foreign Relations , a veteran of reconstruction efforts in Iraq , Afghanistan and the former Yugoslavia and strong supporter of intervention in Libya . He said the European Union and NATO might have to be involved perhaps with the Arab League or African Union in what he called a `` light-touch monitoring mission . '' With French jets targeting Libyan armored vehicles on the outskirts of Benghazi on Saturday , military action has already gone well beyond the `` no-fly zone '' initially suggested by Britain and France and endorsed by the Arab League . Even with air strikes , most experts believe the rebels will need outside help to improve their currently near-nonexistent command and control capabilities . The bottom line , some strategists say , is that there are some things only ground forces can do . Once Gaddafi 's forces are mixed amongst civilian areas , there may be little air strikes can achieve without considerable `` collateral damage . '' `` Air power has its limitations , '' said Henry Wilkinson , lead analyst at security consultancy Janusian . `` It will not inflict a decisive blow , nor prevent attacks on civilians in all cases . Only ground forces can take territory , provide local security and impose their political will upon an enemy . '' Analysts point to many unknowns . Will intervention in Libya give new confidence to protesters in other autocratic Middle Eastern states including oil producers -- and how might the West respond ? Could civilian casualties turn local , regional and domestic Western opinion against the campaign and play into the hands of Islamist militants ? `` The early days will go extremely well but will not define whether or not the war is successful , '' wrote Stratfor 's Friedman . `` The test will come if a war designed to stop human suffering begins to inflict human suffering .

Civilian casualties are an unfortunate and unavoidable side effect of the Western airstrikes Western forces have shown disregard for civilian deaths where does it end ? In Yeme , Syria , Bahrein , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , UAE , Nigeria , Ivory Coast , Thailand , Venezuela ? This is a slippery slope caused by Anderson Cooper and Fouad Ajami `` greased '' by oil . Do we never learn ? How many wars will it take till we know , that too many people have died ? The majority of them at the hands of U.S. weaponry . here we go wading in again blinkered , what is the end game if mr. gaddafi do n't play ball with the west ? another occupation of another muslim country ? more overstretched british forces poured into another conflict ? why ar n't the arab nations taking the lead and dealing with the problem surely the political implications for western involvement is obvious . It is no business of the west . I from Canada do not support our military action in Libya . There are better ways and it saddens me to see Canada jump on the US bandwagon . This military action does not benefit the world as a whole , and I hope that Canadians as well as the rest of the world can see this . The end does not justify the means . At the end of the day , this is a civil war , and 2 % of the world s oil production is simply not worth it ladies and gentlemen of the United Nations . It is extremely unfortunate that the innocent citizens of Libya are the victims of Muammar Gaddafi s crazy antics , but ultimately this is their war , and it should remain as such . The United States and its allies should seek to help those on their own sidewalks prior to lending it s resources to other nations . We too vote strongly for an end to all violence and world peace , but we do not have a magic wand to do so immediately , and as history has proven over and over again , before any major reform or change , war precedes . So the rebels are now jumping for joy . There is an old saying that says people who jump for joy should beware of the ground moving beneath their feet . It 's a bit too soon to know how this will play out . One thing for certain is that there will be winners and more losers . The last formal declaration of war was 70 years ago ... `` Only the dead have seen the end of war '' . -LRB- Plato -RRB- War , will never end . From one side or the other , there will be someone who star killing for money or power . Even if you pick a side or not , the effects of war will affect your way of living . So now the Arab League -- whatever the h3ll that is -- has done a 180 and jumps on us for attacking Qaddafi 's air control system . This is exactly why we should never get involved with this stupidity . For heaven 's sake Americans -- wake up ! And Obama was gonna get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan ? -- yeah , right ! The Arab league , the African Union , China , Russia -- a paltry few other nations are against this . Would it have passed a vote in the General assembly , not a pedophile 's chance in Hell . Thank goodness for the Security Council and those who wo n't use their veto . Hear that Mssrs Putin and JinTou ? You used poor phrasing in the second question and you will note that you had the lowest participation in that question . Your question : `` Have the Western forces been prudent in their air strikes or shown disregard for civilian casualties ? '' should have had the following choices : \\* Western forces have demonstrated care in avoiding civilian casualties during the airstrikes Western forces have shown disregard for civilian deaths Why should Western power take notice of this small African nation in turmoil ? It is because of oil , not because of democrazy . In any conflict , Western people are always the aggressors . History is the witness to this . You know the truth is that it does n't end . Of course it does n't end as long as there are ruthless dictators like Gaddafi on the planet , and people who are willing to stand and fight . For those of you who think we can just sit here and watch the stock market in the safety of our own nation , wake up . We do n't control the world anymore , and the only reason we ever came close to doing it was that the rest of the world was bombed back into the middle ages after WW II . Now we are learning that unless we have that kind of a head start , we ca n't compete . If we do n't start standing for Democracy again instead of big money , we will be a has-been in a very short time . The big money is moving quickly to Asia , so now is the time to get back to our principles instead of our financial interests . This exercise by the US , UK , and France has nothing to do with Gaddafi . We do n't know exactly the reasons but it is not about a `` ruthless dictator . '' If that were the case , we would have been bombing most of Africa and the middle east . Use your brains , people . All of the arab nations even Saudi Arabia will be burning under the bombs of the US . This is it boys the final battle between Muslims and Christians . It 's the crusades all over again just like George W. Bush said when he invaded Iraq . Man your weapons the fight is going to Iran soon . We should have used those resources to bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities and their mullahs . They are the real threat to us . Libya was of no particular importance to us and was not a threat . The rebels want us to do the heavy lifting so they can take over , but they will hate us as much as Qadaffi does . I must say , today 's comments here are some of the dumbest I 've seen in a long time ... If there had n't been airstrikes , Gaddafi was about to slaughter thousands , and then the chant would 've been `` Oh , the USA can go into countries that benefit them , but they let this slaughter happen , just like in Rwanda ! '' Now that the US has followed the request of the Arab League , African Org . , to stop a slaughter in a very limited engagement and the same accusations pop up . One ca n't have it both ways ; accuse the international community of `` allowing '' slaughter to happen in Rwanda , then criticizing us for trying to stop it this time . And how about we wait for data on the ground to tell us whether US forces killed civilians and not take the King of Liars , Gaddafi 's word for it ? Russia and China 's playing both sides of the fence is getting EXTREMELY tiring at this point . I agree the USA should back away now that we 've dropped the air defenses , but I wanted to post here lamenting the extremely poor quality of the comments here today . Bomb Gaddafi 's airforces and ammo dumps . Any military columns that appear from Gaddafi 's side . Let the rebels fight their way to freedom . They are doing the heavy lifting -LRB- fighting and dying -RRB- . Our Air Forces and Navys are flying jets and pressing buttons . This is the kind of war we should have brought to Iraq in 1991 . We should have been protecting the citizens in the north and south when they tried to rebel against Hussein . We should have protected them . It would have been easier and cheaper than invading the country for a ground war the second time ' round . Instead the Republican President and his men told us stories about WMD . What the Republicans are doing now as a party to run inteference on Obama amounts to hypocrisy . I 'm sure if Obama did nothing then the Republicans would have roasted him for that too . The Republicans have been completely counter-productive for the past 6-8 years . They supported the people who took down our economy . Turned a blind eye . Spent our wealth on two unnecessary unproductive ground wars . Now they 've done everything they could to undermine our current president when our country needs all our leaders to make productive suggestions and carefully steer our country out of this economic quagmire . I supported them in previous elections but NEVER again . I 'll vote 3rd or 4th party if necessary . I 'll always vote against them . If the West had n't gone in there would have been a brutal slaughter and the maniac would have still been in charge -LRB- recharged too -RRB- . He would have cracked down that much harder on his own people . All he had to do was step down . During all these protests in every case the gov ' ts have started shooting first . They have started killing their own peoples , their own neighbors . Let 's help the Middle East leave the 6th century behind and join the 21st century . Our gov ' t also needs to quit funding these kinds of dictators -- see Yemen and Egypt for examples . While I do support the NATO action , I would rather see Quadaffi step down , with a Diplomatic soloution . the Libyan civilians must be protected from both air and land . Perhaps UN blue helmets can be sent in to protect civilians from Quadaffi 's ground assault that cont . If the Arab League of Nations , France , and the UK feel it is necessary to attack Libya then we should let them do so . Quadaffi must be stopped . However , who says the U.S. should have to lead or be involved ? We are already fighting two wars and we can not afford a third . These other countries have missiles and bombs , why the hell do n't they take care of it ? These countries appear to have no conviction . They want us to lead so they will have someone to blame if it does n't pan out the way they want it to . We should have submitted our approval at the UN and then been done with it . We , the United States , can not police the world . For once I 'd like to see the Arab League of Nations take care of their own ! They have the means to get rid of Quadaffi . Now they are criticizing us as usual . Why do n't they just admit that they support the governing methods of Quadaffi and reveal their true colors . France and Britain need to step up if they really want to do something about this . We should support them , short of being involved . Gaddafi must be eliminated '' a la Saddam '' Gaddafi is a psychopath who abused Libya , had scores of innocent people in Libya , Europe , etc killed Gaddafi abused human rights for more than 41 years Like David Koresh or Rev Jones of Jonestown , he thinks he is a prophet ... . . he has always overestimated himself ... . . now he must go and let Libya live in peace and prosperity He dilapidated Libya 's resources for his own gratification . He is a murderous dictator and must go now Obama opted for the lesser of two evils . And now he is working to minimize US exposure to the financial and geopolitical blowback by pressing to have allies carry the load for a change . And yes , those nations that believe democracy and freedom are what is best for people around the world should stand up and help defend those who would fight for it , no matter where they exist . Yemen , Syria , Iran , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , anywhere . This is n't about religion Mr. Putin and others who prefer the status quo , it is about one less dictatorship or theocratic regime in the world capable of supressing human rights , democracy , and personal freedoms ... including the right to worship as you choose , and to speak your minds as you choose , absent violent repression . So where are all the people calling Obama a war criminal ? I guess it 's just criminal when a Republican is in office . Or I am to gather that finally people have woken up a bit to realize the world is better off without tyrants and that doing nothing really means supporting those tyrants actions ? The difference between what happened in Egypt versus what happened in Libya is that Libyan citizens took up arms against their government . The moment they did that , civil disobedience became a civil war . It seems to me that deciding to support a military action like this is a low cost opportunity to pick up GW Bush 's baton in trying to encourage democracy to be adopted in the area . There must be a strategic benefit or we would n't act . this war is not about the freedom of Libyans . It is all about controlling Libyan OIL . What about the democracy in Saudi Srabia -LRB- one of the most brutal regimes in the world -RRB- !! What about Bahrain ? They wont do anything to these countries coz they already have the control over their OIL . And what about the other half of Libyans who support Gaddafi ? Their opinion doesnt count ? Why doesnt the west bomb China then , poor Tibetans , under brutal Chinese rule for more than 50 years ? Coz Tibet doesnt have any OIL that the west can not exploit . Why no fly zone in Ivory Coast ... more people dead there than in Libya . Its so sad to see that western powers ignoring all these and expecting the people around the world believe their selfish reasoning . You really gotta love these polls . You got a majority supporting Obama 's cowardly air strikes , while at the same time , that same majority opposes sending in ground troops that can effectively end the whole situation immediately . Please I pray to my GOD that we do not let this golden chance to take out this insane madman now that we have been given the green light to go for it pass us by ? Recently Ireland changed its government , in peaceful election . The people voted to change a government that was damaging the interests of the people of Ireland . Until the people in countries across the world want to vote to change their governments , dictators like Gadaffi and his ilk steal away peoples freedom and there precious lives . Freedom has to be taken by you , or is taken from you . George W. Bush stated that the Iraq war was justified to free the Iraqi people and spread democracy . That was a full invasion . Now we have potentially the whole Arab world doing exactly that -LRB- take matters in their own hand -RRB- and we do n't even want to give them aircover and drop some bombs ?? Come on people , stop the hypocrisy . Have you seen anyone burning US flags ? I have n't and I think that is a good thing for once . So let 's give them a helping hand . They may thank us . Other than that , we should stop buying their oil . No oil , no money for their leaders\\/dictators . The US Constitution demands that every US President obtain a Declaration of War from Congress unless the US is in imminent danger . -- - President Obama ignored Congress and went on a junket . -- - President Bush II was guilty of the same crimes and it 's a pity and an indictment of our society that he was n't impeached . -- - Just because we ` do n't like ' a foreign leader does not give our country the right or the moral imperitive to meddle offensively in their matters . -- - Having the UN front for our trespasses does n't make them right . We were supposed to be in and out of Korea , Vietnam , Iraq , and Afghanistan . None of these predictions came true . We ca n't afford to be the world 's policeman . It is interesting to read historical accounts of those actually subject to tyranny such as a Russian in a Stalin gulag and a Jew in Auschwitz both wished for the bombs to rain from the sky to release them from their hell on earth . They did not care if they were killed in the process but at least it would be an indication fellow humanity was willing to fight to save them . Alas the Berlin wall came down to late for most and the Allies were not able to prevent the worst of the genocide against other by the German Nazi not only against Jews . Are we now to condemn these victims of tyranny to a similar fate as we sit on the side lines pontificating on how nasty war is and gee why don t they just sit down nicely and work it out ? If we lived in pacifist fairy land great idea but we do not and never have . So for those on the streets now of Africa and the Middle East bravely facing death unarmed or with comparatively less fire power than their rivals as in Libya . Do we once again forsake them because it is none of our business given they are other or do we realize finally we are as responsible for them and their families happiness as we are for our own ? One day soon we may search vainly the sky and horizon for release from heavy chains or imminent destruction of all we love and cherish . 100 cruise missiles shot over the first day or two alone at a reported $ 700,000 a piece -LRB- $ 70 million dollars for the first day alone -RRB- a downed fighter jet I would imagine is somewhere between $ 15 - $ 22 million dollars for a total of $ 92 million dollars and that 's just for a few different types of equipment during the first few days the tip of the ice berg that is n't counting all money it costs to move aircraft carriers , battle ships , fuel and everything else involved with this silliness . To get some rebel fighters who no one knows who they are who appear to be hardcore muslim radicals -LRB- some interviewed said they did n't like Gaddafi because he was n't muslim enough -RRB- and may even have ties to al queda into power ? What a waste of American money , time and resources . Not good times for anyone any where in the world mostly brought on by greed around the world but at no time can any of us avoid an opportunity to support a democratic development where dictatorships have forever kept the world on edge and caste a dark shadow on human hope . As weary tired and broke as we can be . . We have to help those who are even more weary and tired of living but not living at all . What the hell happened to North Korea ? In Libya , the opposition has guns . In North Korea , the people are getting raped but are too brainwashed to realize . Kim Jong-Il is literally starving his people while eating food from his 5-star chef ! So let me get this straight . Most of Europe , and a good many Americans -- especially Obama -- decried our move to take out Saddam , but this is OK ? Aside from the fact that Saddam owned - and used - chemical weapons , could 've taught Gaddafi a thing or two about killing his own people , Iraq is strategically positioned on the border of Iran and the Persian gulf . What in the world will taking out Gaddafi do for us ? And besides , do the Western leaders really believe they can `` sort of '' make war ? The world has been feminized . Our leaders do n't have balls anymore -- and I 'm talking about the men ! We have a thing which the artist Mel Chin has represented in full size and it has allegedly been dropped on civilians . It is known as a Daisy Cutter , a ten-thousand pound bomb . Its name is a clue : it detonates above ground and for acres there will stand nothing taller than a Daisy . We target and murder people often , and while I do not approve and I believe it is counterproductive , why is a mass murdering dictator given diplomatic immunity ? Just one at his last known address would either finish the problem , or demoralize the survivors . One Daisy Cutter , not scattered strikes on private soldiers , would stop MoMo G. , and only two more would stop his sons . If Saddam ever had and used chemical weapons , and at one time he did , he got them from US Taxpayers . We bought them and gave them to him to use against Iran and the Kurds . We stripped him of these weapons before the eight year idiot war was started by bush . bush lied , and we still have billions a week expense doing it . We fund most of the dictators in the world . Democracy will break out eventually , in spite of our efforts . Daisy Cut MoMo and let Libya try to get some democracy . Who is going to pay for the wars ? We are already under water for national budget and also big deficit . I see no reason to pick up another `` easy '' war . This will not benefit the cotry a a whole only the military industry .

China , with Russia , India , Brazil and other developing countries have condemned the U.S.-led air strikes on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as risky and unwarranted overreaching by the West . The shared opposition to the Libya campaign could become a point of diplomatic convergence among the `` BRICS '' bloc of major emerging economies -- Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa -- which hold a summit in south China next month . But it is unlikely to evolve into united action by this disparate group of countries , with their own mutual rivalries , said Shi Yinhong , a professor of international security at Renmin University in Beijing . `` Undoubtedly , many developing countries see a dangerous precedent in the Western attacks and intervention -LRB- in Libya -RRB- in what is fundamentally a civil war , '' said Shi . `` But Russia , China and the others will be afraid of a serious break with the United States or offending the Arab countries , so they wo n't push their opposition far , '' he said . `` I think the idea that the BRIC countries would act as a coalition on this is outlandish . They are too deeply meshed with the West to risk a split , '' Shi added . Western powers began the strikes against Libya over the weekend in a U.N.-sanctioned campaign to target air defenses , enforce a no-fly zone and protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . India , China and Russia -- which , along with Brazil , abstained from last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution -- have a history of opposing intervention in sovereign states . They opposed the U.S.-led campaign over Kosovo in the 1990s , when the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was bombed , and also opposed the U.S. led invasion of Iraq . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , compared the campaign in Libya to the Iraq invasion , saying it `` resembles medieval calls for crusades . Brazil 's criticisms have been relatively muted . On Monday , it called for a ceasefire in Libya and regretted the loss of life there . Of the BRICS , only South Africa supported the U.N. Resolution . China has been among the loudest in voicing opposition . `` We have noted the reports about civilian casualties from the military action against Libya by the countries concerned , and we express our deep concern about this , '' the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news conference in Beijing . `` The original intent of the -LRB- U.N. -RRB- Security Council resolution was to protect the security of the Libya 's people . We oppose the wanton use of armed force causing even more civilian casualties and an even bigger humanitarian disaster . '' She added that French President Nicolas Sarkozy , a strong proponent of the most vocal proponents of the no-fly zone over Libya , will visit China at the end of March to attend a seminar on global monetary reform . `` What is happening in a country , within their internal affairs , no external powers should interfere in it , '' Pranab Mukherjee , India 's finance minister and leader of the lower house of parliament , told lawmakers in New Delhi on Tuesday . `` Nobody , not a couple of countries , can take that decision to change a particular regime , '' Mukherjee said . The emerging powers could maintain their more united front over Libya in the coming weeks ahead of the BRICS summit in China , said Srinath Raghavan , a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi . `` If there is a serious ceasefire proposal or negotiated settlement , then the BRICS could well jump in diplomatically . They may want to then shape a global consensus if the West 's policies get in trouble , '' Raghavan said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

ABUJA | Tue Mar 22 , 2011 10:35 am EDT ABUJA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Nigeria 's foreign minister has accused the international community of double standards by imposing a no-fly zone to protect civilians in Libya while doing little to end abuses in crisis-torn Ivory Coast . Nigeria is the linchpin of West African bloc ECOWAS , which has threatened the use of force in Ivory Coast to push incumbent Laurent Gbagbo from power after he refused to accept defeat in an election the United Nations said rival Alassane Ouattara won . Around 400 Ivorians have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the disputed poll . Thousands of youth supporters of Gbagbo answered a call to join the army this week , adding fuel to fear that the violent power struggle risks sending the country back to civil war . Western powers , led by the U.S. , have in recent days launched air strikes and enforced a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians as the country 's leader Muammar Gaddafi fights a civil war against rebels trying to oust him from power . Speaking at the commissioning of a new foreign ministry building in the capital Abuja , Nigerian Foreign Minister Odein Ajumogobia said the contradictions were `` impossible to ignore '' . `` The contradictions between principle and national interest ... have enabled the international community to impose a no-fly zone over Libya ostensibly to protect innocent civilians from slaughter , but to watch seemingly helplessly -LRB- in Ivory Coast -RRB- as ... men , women and children are slaughtered in equally , even if less egregious violence , '' he said . The United States and the European Union have imposed travel bans and other sanctions on Gbagbo and his inner circle but West African nations will need to take a lead if there is to be any attempt to remove him by force , diplomats say . Ajumogobia said last month that any military intervention in Ivory Coast would need to be U.N.-led and was more likely to involve an aerial and naval blockade than deploying troops to its cities . African states have been at odds over the use of force since the crisis began . Nigeria and Sierra Leone see Gbagbo 's defiance as a risk to regional peace and efforts to nurture democracy . Other countries have publicly criticised the way in which the United Nations , African Union , ECOWAS and other Western nations quickly recognized Ouattara as victor . ECOWAS leaders are due to meet in Nigeria 's capital Abuja this week to discuss their next move in the Ivorian crisis . There have already been several mediation efforts .

The area stretching roughly from Morocco to Afghanistan west to east , and Syria to the Persian Gulf north to south -- let s call this region Deathistan -- long has been contested . But in the last century , the region has been treated as a plaything by Western capitals . The United States and United Kingdom , which boast of enlightenment , cause harm when they please in the Deathistan region . Less than a generation ago it amused the United States to encourage Saddam Hussein to slaughter Iranians ; then conditions changed , so the United States started killing in Iraq . Right now the United States and NATO are taking lives in Libya and Afghanistan . In these places , U.S. and other Western armed forces in the main behave with high ethics . But their missions are to slay and destroy , and here s the bottom line : Western meddling in north Africa , the Arab world and the Great Game territories has not worked . Israel exists : that is the West s principal achievement in the region , though for a comparatively small number of people . Otherwise , the last century of attempts by the United States and European powers to manipulate the Deathistan region rarely has come to good . We ve sure blown a lot of stuff up . When innocents were killed inside the United States on 9-11 , America claimed , with justification , a right of outrage . When innocents are killed by Western action elsewhere -- hundreds of thousands have died in Iraq and Afghanistan in the U.S. retaliation for the 3,000 dead of 2001 -- the West washes its hands , or issues a press release . Muammar Gaddafi is an awful dictator . But no one in the Washington or London establishments seemed to care about that even a short time ago . Libyan oil money was moving freely ; in 2009 , Gaddafi was presented to the world by the New York Times as an op-ed columnist , as a leader and sage . Now the West is bombing Libya , without debate in Congress or European parliaments -- and over the objections of Turkey , which understands much of the region better than does the West . Though aimed at Gaddafi s arms , some of the bombs are killing civilians : others , killing military conscripts who have little choice about their fates . Maybe the bombing will stop Gaddafi from repressing his country . Maybe it will just smash some stuff and usher in a different type of repression -- this being the Western pattern of interactions with the region . Despite extensive Western involvement in Deathistan , most nations there remain backward and authoritarian . Maybe that s in part because of Western meddling , including periodic fits of use of force . Much of the modern form of the region was created by Western fiat . Borders of Iraq , Iran and many Gulf states were drawn in London ; British troops occupied Iran during World War II ; the United States deposed a democratically elected government in Iran in 1953 , then tried to control Iran in the 1970s ; then armed Iraq against Iran in the 1980s ; now regularly shakes its fist at Tehran ; Britain and France attacked Egypt in 1956 ; the United States armed Islamic rebels in Afghanistan in the 1980s and now fights Islamic rebels there . I don t mean this paragraph as a history of the region , merely a brief reminder of the extent of Western involvement . The fact that Europe and the United States shaped the Deathistan region does not give them a right to do as they please there . Of course the West should advocate change . But there s a vast difference between siding with democracy and sending in attack jets . Choose any nation roughly the geographic size of Iraq -LRB- say , Spain -RRB- or roughly the population of Libya -LRB- say , Sicily -RRB- . If the United States had staged all-out attacks on Spain twice in the last 20 years , or bombed Sicily twice in the last 25 years , how advanced or happy might these nations be ? That s what the United States has done to Iraq and Libya . Suppose really something bad were happening in America . Suppose George W. Bush refused to leave office : was barricaded in the White House , and attempting to cancel civil liberties . Now suppose Libya or Iraq possessed supercarrier strike groups , and responded to the bad news from the United States by launching missiles at military bases near Washington and dropping bombs along the East Coast . Not only would America be furious -- this wouldn t work ! Things would not get better in America ; they d get worse . Yet the West expects such tactics to work in north Africa , the Middle East and the old Great Game areas . I will skip the complication that use of force may be morally wrong : is there one single soul in Washington who still cares about morality in use of force ? It is enough that the bottom line is that U.S. meddling usually fails . If the United States and European Union stopped trying to manipulate the Deathistan region , and stopped dropping bombs there , the nations of this area might stay backward and repressive . Or , might improve . We ll never find out until such time as the West simply leaves these nations alone , and lets them reform themselves .

The fighter jet crashed in Libya overnight after apparent mechanical failure but its crew were safe , a spokesman for the U.S. military Africa Command said on Tuesday . REUTERS\\/Suhaib Salem ; A protester sits in a makeshift shelter on a street during an anti-Gaddafi demonstration in Benghazi March 22 , 2011 . Obama has proved to be an imperialist not unlike W. What a dirty farce ! Like your term in quotes . The sudden shift from dragging one 's feet to support a no-fly zone , to taking leaderhsip in all out bombing was quite unexpected and drastic . It almost seems like they wanted to use the Arab League 's support as an excuse ; and once they got it , their action betrayed a certain insincerity . I hope the fighting end soon , with limited casualty for everyone . I have reservations about whether some of the Middle Eastern conflicts are going to result in democracies . Egypt is hopeful , but not many of the others , Libya included . If the civil war becomes protracted , even if there will be fair democratic elections , those who had voted for losig candidates often resort to violence . Look at Ivory Coast . Not to be a pessimist , but such situations seem rather common in Africa . Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the region is the gross incompetence of Western governments , especially the USA . There are plenty of neutral American citizens who have first hand knowledge of and on the ground experience in the region . I exclude all recipients of Federal funding however indirect . Consultation with these experienced people would have avoided the worst mistakes at least . But we will not . We have expert commentators on Government radio -LRB- NPR -RRB- who do not seem to know that Turks are not arabs , yet have ever so delicate evaluations of the accuracy of Turkish opinion . This is not only absurd , it is embarrassing . Since we will not even attempt to act in the interest of the American people as a whole , we need to put a flat Cuban style embargo on the whole region until we grow up . The bureaucrats hands must be tied and tightly . So what 's the point of the UN Security Council ? Why are we a part of it ? We should have used our resources to take out Iran 's nuclear program and perhaps their leaders if we should bomb anyone . We are n't doing them or us any favors . Whether it 's capitalists or democratic government it really all comes down to having access to cheap oil . If they did n't have oil the US would n't be there . Now no one can deny that the foreign Policy of the United States has always been a twisted loop of hypocrisy in the Middle East and even globally . But to generalize the current situation in Libya and make comparisons to the invasions of Iraq , Afghanistan in the last decade as well as previous foreign policy disasters of previous decades is inflammatory at best . As the worlds only nation that can project considerable power anywhere in the world within 48 hours , it is our responsibility to lead and act to prevent humanitarian disasters in conjunction with local , regional and international consultation . There is no indication or confirmation of any civilians killed by coalition aircraft in Libya to date . There is a clear UN mandate that specifies no ground troops and a clear indication that the opposition forces in Libya wanted , in fact begged for western protection against overwhelming and indiscriminate attacks by Gaddafi forces against cities and civilian targets . This is not Iraq in 2003 , and its not Afghanistan . With great power comes great responsibility , like it or not we have a role to play in the Middle East and without pressure from the United States none of the current revolutions in the Middle East would have succeeded without considerable bloodshed if at all . It is the only reason the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia step down as quietly as they did . What is happening right now in the Middle East is not because of the United States , but of the people . This is the best chance in 50 years to make a meaningful change in one of the most volatile and radical regions of the world . We must stand ready to assist , not interfere but assist when absolutely necessary the pro-democracy movements lest they be brutally crushed by these regimes , and we are stuck continuing with brutal regimes that oppress their populations and drive people towards extremism and violence . I understand your opinion , but given the completely different circumstances of the situation in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan and international and regional support for action we must take a lead as is our responsibility . Because if we do n't do it , no one will . We can not fear to act in the future , because of mistakes in the past . You left out the cold war . You leave out the military actions in other parts of the world fueled by the cold war . The three super powers The USSR , the USA and China all wanted a long reach and they have played the balance of powers game that was the rule of European politics since the Middle Ages . In fact it has been the rule for all empires for as long as they have existed . The balance of powers is expected and not to participate is to declare weakness to the other powers . The big powers frighten each other into action . And all the empires that have ever existed have died long and lingering deaths to be replaced by new powers . The new powers cannibalize the old . I am old enough to remember history classes that praised the virility of countries that could support aggressive military action and not merely defensive capability . For some reason the USA keeps declaring itself the sole super power and doesn t seem to realize that rhetoric might be out of date . I m sure the British and French still think they are or might yet reclaim some of their old martial and territorial glory or at least can play on the memory of it . The superpower has to push against something as large and strong or it will fall over . In a way it is making the rival empire it needs out of Deathistan as you call the countries of the Magreb and Levant . You don t mention the rhetoric of the Middle East just listen to the way the Israeli s and Palestinians talk about each other in fits of rage . They still believe in the glory of war and the Israeli s still believe in the right of holding territory by conquest . The Iranians still like that Death to America mantra . The Middle East has a fondness for Iron handed leadership . Perhaps what should really scare the US is that it is tending to have to make the greatest efforts and spend the largest fortunes for dubious returns in order to achieve goals the rest of the world seems to want -LRB- the rights outlined in the UN Universal Bill of Human Rights ? -RRB- while the rest of the so called former super powers and the rest of the smaller countries tend to want a less active role and watch from a distance and wait while it slowly falls apart economically and politically . They can play the economic lambs to our ravenous beast . And then declare how stupid we were for being so arrogant . So many people admire and envy a superstar but they also love to watch it become over-extended and fall apart . The supermarket tabloids love the collapse of the rich and famous . Diplomats and heads of state read classier and more complex tales of the rise and fall of the formerly great . Another thing you don t mention , and where this comment may be so na ve , is that the collapse of the middle class in this country is making conditions that could be ripe for a tyranny to take over this country -LRB- some would say we are already there -RRB- that feeds on war as an outlet for the frustration of it s own population . Then the US could be a world-dominating scourge of humanity . But if that is the case this paragraph should go at the top and the rest would still follow , just perhaps not in my lifetime or in the lifetime of those still in grammar school . But they would have to be teaching a rabid patriotism for that to work and as far as I know they aren t . What a great overview of what happens when the west interferes . I do hope more people take note of the fact , interference in other nations affairs which seems to happen regularly by the west simply does not produve the expected result . As long as you are pro - west any country can do what it likes , murder half its citizens and the west will ignore it or put out a mild press staement . If the murder is done by a leader opposed to the west then the response is not as mild but close to hysterical condemnation and interferece in one form or another . At thee same time the west only interferes openly in countries who can not fight back , which certainly shows how courageous the western politicians are . Apples to oranges , Mr. Easterbrook . This `` article '' is overflowing with idiotic comparisons that would n't hold water in a 5th grade book report , let alone succeed in coming close to substantiating your argument . I can t imagine how it can ever be perceived by logically thinking humans capable of counting to ten , as anything but a hollow-minded rant . How did you get this published , anyway ? Your `` opinion '' is shallow , ill-conceived and presented poorly at its best . I have yet to hear from a single source that innocent Libyan `` civilians '' have officially been killed by Western forces , either by air or land strike . I agree that it is highly questionable that we empower Gaddhafi at first then daemonize him when he complicates our energy resources ... but that 's the nature of world politics . And for the sake of human rights and treaty efforts , I do n't think it would have been smart to denounce Gaddhafi as leader in the West -- look what that did to Cambodia -- it gives the impression that all potential interventions are out -LRB- nobody cares -RRB- . I also do n't think allies `` encourage '' allies , in the Hussein Iran example you `` responsibly '' made , in times of war to kill as simply as you implied . Do n't forget that there were innocent civilians under Hussein 's regime who were being attacked . Libya would have been another Rwanda , Darfur , and we 'd be left shaking our heads again -- no matter what , you 're not going to `` win '' participating or watching violence . You 're choice : are you a selfish perv , or a murdering idealist ? You need a reality check . Spain is not Libya . Sicily is not Iraq . Their leaders are not raping the citizens of all their wealth . Oil money from Iraq and Libya went straight to the dictator 's pockets . You are living in a democracy and have the freedom to write tripe like this . Nontheless , your opinions are not widely held , thank God . What a load of rubbish . But for the oil and natural gas under their feet , the entire world would care about this `` vital region '' as much as they do about the Seychelle Islands . But their fossil fuel resources bring them wealth and influence disproportionate to their actual economic contributions to the world economy and its culture . The spoils of this wealth have allowed murderous thugs to maintain themselves in a style an Ottoman sultan would have blushed at . I forget , how many palaces did Saddam Hussein have ? They must all have been justified by the legacy of colonialism -LRB- Up yours Imperialists ! -RRB- . One looks on in admiration at what went on in Egypt and is going on elsewhere in the region where people realize they do n't have to live this way . But maybe this author could also mention the proliferation of Soviet produced arms in the region . Surely there was no titanic geopolitical struggle that went on for 40 plus years that could explain the constant shifting of national interests that occurred . Nope , must all be a conspiracy by the whole world -LRB- led by the perfidious West -RRB- to have cheap oil -LRB- the majority of which is controlled by an altruistic and benign cartel that meets in Vienna -RRB- under the control of pliable despots . One knows Arabs are never personally responsible for anything , ever , right ? Least of all the resignation that it is written they be pawns in the game of life . From Pogo : `` We have met the enemy and he is us . '' Well said Mr. Easterbrook . Of course the solutions are extremely complicated . But , these simple truths must guide all solutions . The simple comparison to our US homeland is a perfect example . This is a beautifully written and elegantly argued column . A couple of years ago I would have agreed with it . But Deathistan has changed . What we are seeing today in the Middle East are revolutions started not by Al Qeuda , not by the CIA , but by the people themselves . These uprisings are not imposed on them , and they are not inspired by ideologues of either the Muslim or Western variety . The people are fighting for democracy . They have been ruled by ruthless despots for generations and have no arms to fight with , which makes their struggle all the more courageous . Should the West just sit back in its armchair and watch the bloody and unbalanced spectacle on TV ? Is that the right thing to do ? Or should we help them fight for a just cause which , in the case of Libya , would surely be doomed without our help ? I agree that the West has a bad and deserved reputation for meddling in the affairs of the Middle East -LRB- and elsewhere . -RRB- But there 's an important difference between meddling solely for one 's own political or economic gain and helping in a struggle whose cause we believe in , and that would surely perish without our intervention . The Middle East is younger , restless , wary of the old order , and ready for change . They are realizing that clinging to an ideology is not the answer , that they need to stumble forward on the path of democracy and find their own way . In some ways , we can learn from their example . Does it make sense , and is it always for the good , to cling to an ideology of non-intervention , regardless of the circumstances ? What are the consequences ? We all need to be aware of our ideologies . It 's easy to judge Islamists and Teabaggers when they appear rigid to those who do n't share their beliefs . But if you believe rigidity is a problem , take a look at the man in the mirror , and face your own non-interventionist beliefs . You need n't go into such a scholarly print to decipher what 's in the minds of these politicians . It 's all about oil and the dollar sign . Whenever there 's turmoil that threatens the flow and price of this precious liquid , the big guys are in . Not to save the locals , but their wallets . The U.S. was swift in rescuing Kuwait from Saddam not because they like the handsome looks of the Kuwaitis . Did they blink an eye when locals were butchered by Indonesian forces in East Timor ? Easterbrook has some valid points . Where this and other regional conflicts have changed recently is in the communications . It would have taken hard people to ignore the often live pleas for help heard on the news channels . And of course there is the oil . There are plenty of dictators in Africa who make Gadaffi seem almost saintly . What puzzle me is why UN step on their toes as soon as something does not goes the way the Western Powers would like it to be . The world will be better off without Gadhafi s type of government , but the reality is , nothing is perfect in this world including the so call democracy . Where these International Zorro s were when Pinochet was protected by Thatcher s government against crime of humanity ? What about Fujimori from Chile killing his people by thousands ? You may say they were fighting again the bad guys ; the communists . So , they deserve the support of Zorro to save the world . Same question can be asked about Pol Pot in Cambodia and Marcos in the Philippe and all others . Until UN will be free of manipulation by Western Powers all those Zorro s will continue to shape the world to their own goods which have nothing to do with democracy . Unfortunately is a word to often use to justify the unjustifiable . Now gregg , imagine this scenario . A high ranking official of your state is slaughtering the people in your area . This person has gone mad and is doing as he pleases with no reprocussions . The people have started a revolt . The have started to stand up to him . To regain the basic humanitarian rights they deserve . And he being more technologically advanced goes day by day toying with their lives . Would you then not want help ? These people are asking for help . Why should we sit back and not protect those who need it when we have the ability to help ? If we would give up a little luxury here and there we would not be in this financial whole we are in now and we would be able to do more for these people who have no way to defend themselves . Your local police department did n't always exist . It was put there to protect you when you needed it . I know the US or the western countries as you name it are not the official police for this planet . So the UN and the US has stepped up to try to protect those who need it . Maybe one day we can get a World Police Order put in place that would allow the world as a whole to decide what a country can do . We rely to heavily on one another to let tyrants destroy the people they are put into place to protect . Is this battle about oil ? I dont know , none of us common folk do . Will we ever know ? But whether we went in for oil or for the people , as long as we are able to save a few lives of those who are fighting every day to survive and being oppressed then for whatever reason we are there , the outcome will be better for those people . They will have a chance . What comes of that chance is for them to decide . Interesting point of view , but from a greedy point of view would n't it have been in America 's interest to allow Gaddafi to wipe out much of his opposition in Libya ? It 's been years since Gaddafi has threatened the West and he was unlikely to do so during the rest of his life . Libya was becoming a popular tourist destination . The current unrest is a factor in driving the price of oil higher at a time when America 's economy can ill afford increased energy costs . It seems to me that America is trying to shape a Libyan government that is a grateful friend at a time when not taking action might cost more lives than taking action . It also appears based on the current situation that Middle East autocracies would probably do very little good for their citizens if left to their own devices . The current revolutions in the area seem to be a genuine attempt by the people to improve their own lot in an otherwise hopeless situation . Nonetheless , your arguments have some merit . Posted by breezinthru | Report as abusive Thank you for finally stating what has so often been relegated to `` dissident '' or `` minority '' publications on a mainstream news outlet . Major figures on the American Left and Right would concur with you : from Noam Chomsky and Bernie Sanders to Ron Paul and Grover Norquist . The imperialist war state will impoverish the basis of its own power -- as it did the empires of Alexander , Rome , Khan , the Soviet Union and eventually the United States . In our case , it is waged in the name of defense , but any idiot knows that 's just a byline for oil : Iraq 2 being the primary and most obvious example , though this is also the case for Afghanistan -LRB- Osama , the boogieman , is STILL not wanted as a suspect for 911 , yet Unocal 's pipeline project has proceeded quite smoothly -RRB- . You mention only the Middle East , but we also must realize that trade interests have motivated illegal and undemocratic regime change coups in Latin America for more than 60 years . The economic benefits of our not-so-covert oil and free trade zone war Imperialism are only distributed to a few in our society , precisely because it is not `` we '' who desire or direct these efforts : it is the prerogative of the few industrial and commercial forces that stand to gain from them in the short term . I find the assurances that the Middle East can never find peace , and that Western nations are wasting our time , money , and everyone 's lives to be both sad and ironic . The reasonic seems clear , blood feuds going back centuries , widespread inequality and violations of human rights . Wars such as that between Iran and Iraq , and the Soviet war in Afghanistan cost about a million lives each . What hope can there be for the future ? Better to just look the other way while they butcher , burn , poison , and stone each other like they have been for millenia right ? Ironically a bit over half a centry ago it would have been just as clear that Europe was spiraling into a pattern of perpetual bloodshed of ever more massive proportions . The rule of thumb was once a pan-European war once per generation . Yet today Europe is at peace . How bout tit-for-tat blood feuds ? Consider the history of revaunchism that led to WWII . That goes back to the conquest of Prussia by the French under Napoleon in 1806 , almost a century and a half before . `` Civilized '' people have long memories too ! Prussia was forced to pay santions afterward , and those sanctions formed the basis for the sanctions placed on the French after Germany defeated France in 1871 . These sanctions in turn formed the basis of those placed on Germany in the treaty of Versailles after WWI , which helped set the stage for WWII . And while the death toll seen in Middle Eastern wars and terrorism may seem shocking to us today , just one battle in WWI killed as many people as either of the two most brutal wars in the Middle East . While those wars cost a million lives a piece , the first world war cost 16 million European lives , and set the stage for world war two which cost 40 million European lives , with the firebombing of cities killing tens of thousands of civilians in a single day . What Middle-Eastern blood feud has spilled such blood ? The peace in Europe today is testimony to the ability of humanity to put behind us the collective harms and insults of generations past no matter how grievous they might have been . If Europe can live in peace today , peace is possible for any people , anywhere . Interesting point of view , but from a greedy point of view would n't it have been in America 's interest to allow Gaddafi to wipe out much of his opposition in Libya ? It 's been years since Gaddafi has threatened the West and he was unlikely to do so during the rest of his life . Libya was becoming a popular tourist destination . The current unrest is a factor in driving the price of oil higher at a time when America 's economy can ill afford increased energy costs .

Posted by breezinthru | Report as abusive What we are seeing are the seeds of World War 3 sprouting . Deathistan is where empires go to die ... . . and we have seen this happen over and over again throughout history . It 's amazing how if you got back even further you will observe that even back to the Greeks , Romans , Barbarians , Ottomans etc ... . . it 's simply the course of history repeating itself . Einstein said World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones ... well just look around you . If you assume for a second that the so called `` allies '' of the U.S. or even the members of the so called security council are allied with the U.S. by choice , then you are gravely mistaken . These countries under different circumstances would turn against the U.S. in a heartbeat . The main culprit of our present global design is the great Winston Churchill . The entire middle east and Africa was carved out in London ... . remember the Sykes Picot Agreement of 1916 ? Think Lawrence of Arabia , General Allenby , Prince Faisal I of Arabia -LRB- not Saudi Arabia ... and you wonder why the west till this very day have a `` close '' relationship with the Faisals of Saudi Arabia . While this is not a lesson on history , my point is to remember that none of this is new ... . empires go to Deathistan to DIE ! What a relief -- finding a blog and commentary where people can spell . It 's a tricky proposition , ending participation in an entire slice of the world . It is hard to imagine a way to stop military outcomes unless you do that . Mind you , a little more honesty on the political scene could be helpful , and might help international folk gain a better understanding of just where the US of A sits in all this . How about a robust discussion at Presidential level , on the value and application of democracy , regime change , parallel societies , energy , power and Oil Wars ? When you are the biggest Alpha Male in the group there 's nothing wrong with saying `` i see it all like ` this ' , and you may not agree with my decisions but i was elected to make those decisions '' . Politically , it may be a form of suicide but it would certainly shake up the global chatfest scene . As an Australian peeking into -LRB- predominantly -RRB- US discussion forums , it 's hard not to come away with the impression that all attempts at discussion quickly get diluted into a Republican\\/Democrat stand-off . Again , the commentary on this blog seems to be different in that regard , and this makes me feel more positive on American intellectualism than i have felt for quite a while . Apologies for a chatty post . It can be reduced to a suggestion that America can not ignore its place in the global scene , nor pretend it is not a superpower that has to juggle fiercely competing imperatives . It just needs to be more open on why it does what it does , and take any flak that my fly as a result . Not that i 'm an expert ... but i 'm just sayin ' ... It could n't be that their religious believe doom them to generations of failure . Institutional crouption ... has nothing to do with it . It is all the west 's fault ... though they beat and murder their own women and children under a crude `` moral '' code . Up next the West holds down the African nations whose tribal beliefs have nothing to do with their amoral living . Westerners who arrive in these place are successful , but people like Mugabe are the fault of the west . Why not place blame where it belongs ... no different why the Germans are successful and the Belgian 's with dysfunctional and corrupt ways are continuously unsuccessful !

When Ivory Coast s election last year left the country with two men claiming to be president and a flood of warnings of the threat of civil war , the world s diplomatic and media interest was unprecedented . After a turbulent four months , which have seen two North African revolutions , a tsunami and near nuclear meltdown in Japan , and Libya s ongoing war , how that has changed . The West African nation s crisis is grizzly but also in a slow-burn mode and hardly getting a look in with all the drama elsewhere . The international recognition of Alassane Ouattara as victor and sanctions slapped on his rival , incumbent Laurent Gbagbo , who refuses to step down , are still in place . But so is Gbagbo , and Ouattara remains holed up in a hotel , protected by a ring of United Nations peacekeepers . Threats , made by West Africa s ECOWAS bloc , to oust him have rung hollow . Scores of people have since been killed , hundreds of thousands of have fled their homes amid heavy fighting and rights groups are warning crimes against humanity may have already taken place . Both sides have been accused of abuses but the most serious charges including the killing of women protestors calling for Gbagbo to leave have been levelled at Gbagbo . One was even been caught on camera , here , but Gbagbo 's camp has denied responsibility . The country s economy has disintegrated while the IMF warns the regional one is in peril . The long-flagged war has , arguably , already begun . Yet , it appears there are only so many crises the world can handle at any one time and , right now , television cameras and diplomats are looking elsewhere . Nigeria s foreign minister has accused the international community of double standards by imposing the no-fly zone in Libya while doing little in Ivory Coast . Liberia , still recovering from its own conflict , is struggling to raise funds it needs to deal with the refugees it is now taking in . Ouattara has scolded his U.N. backers for not doing enough to protect civilians . With a crisis like Libya taking place , is it only natural that Ivory Coast should drop down the agenda ? Civilians in Ivory Coast , where there is a U.N. peacekeeping mission with a robust mandate , have also been promised protection . Yet , so far , no robust action has been taken , even though the U.N. has accused pro-Gbagbo forces of using heavy weapons against civilians in Abidjan . What is the difference between Ivory Coast and Libya ? Is it just the scale of the abuses or are there other factors at play ? Some analysts and this blogger say Libya s oil makes it more important than Ivory Coast , the world 's top cocoa grower . The African Union had only just finally ironed out internal divisions over supporting Ouattara when it then had to set up another crisis team to deal with Libya . It is wary about too robust an intervention in either case and was still speaking out against military intervention in Libya even after a U.N. resolution had authorised it , and the Western forces had fired their first shots . Can the AU play a meaningful role in resolving Ivory Coast s crisis . If so , what ? Earlier today I was asking myself the same question and it is very hard to not imagine that oil is more important to the world that chocolate , why else would the events in Libya be attracting so much more attention than similar atrocities being committed on African 's across the continent . What worries me is that the winds of change are blowing but more often than not the response will be that of Libya and the World 's policemen -LRB- US , UN , NATO , EU , etc. -RRB- can not be in all the places they will be needed at the same time . The AU in my opinion is rather pointless and too often seems to want to fall back on ex-South African president Thabo Mbeki 's ` quiet diplomacy ' ! Simple the two scenario are not same ; Libyan people started the move in Tripoli , while UN is orchestrating what is happening in Ivory Coast . Nations should be allowed without any form of inducement or cohesion to settle their problem internally . Election dispute in Ivory Coast would have been a thing of the past if UN had not taken side in the dispute . Maybe the UN verdict into the elections was not perfect and there were problems from both sides . However , peace is nearly always better than war . I admire those leaders who have preferred to step down , even if they do n't think the outcome was fully fair , rather than see a lot of bloodshed . A leader 's position should never be more important than the lives , safety and futures of the people . Are values not more important than power ? Is the western world really interested in saving the libyan population ? They are just looking after the Libyan oil . If saving the people was really important , they should be going to Cote divoire where Gbagbo is killing his own people every single day just to stay in power . unfortunately there 's no oil in Cote dIvoire . world should oppose ongoing western air strikes launched against Libya on the ground that ordinary Libyans would be affected and the air attacks would prove counterproductive to the US ' purported humanitarian objective . there are many other hot spots around the world would US do the same . In fact as per records US has never been seen saving lives where they matter most . The video of the female protesters being killed is disturbing . Those unarmed women were not a threat to anyone . Someone did not like what they were saying or perhaps more accurately , someone did n't like that those women decided that they had a right to voice their opinions .

Four senior administration officials , including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , will also brief House members on Libya next Wednesday , a House leadership aide said on Thursday . The aide said the closed-door , classified briefing , which will also involve Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , came at the request of House Speaker John Boehner , who asked Obama in a letter on Wednesday how he would measure success in Libya and whether Muammar Gaddafi had to depart as its leader before the U.S. military involvement ends . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters the administration had consulted repeatedly with Congress and read off a long list of meetings and briefings that the administration had already held for lawmakers . `` It 's part of his responsibility as president on an issue like this to consult with members of Congress , and he has done that . He has instructed senior staff here to do that , and we have in a very substantial way consulted with Congress and will continue to do that , '' Carney said . He refused to let reporters interrupt him , saying , `` It 's important that the American people understand how much consultation there has been . '' Obama would be commenting publicly on Libya `` with relative frequency and relatively soon , '' Carney added . Criticism of Obama for not consulting more with lawmakers before launching the Libyan operation has come from across the political spectrum . Many liberals in Obama 's Democratic Party oppose a third war in the Muslim world on top of U.S. troop commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq . Republicans say the White House did not adequately explain the mission before it began . Carney said Obama could not have waited for Congress to return from a recess because he needed to act quickly to prevent a massacre of Gaddafi 's opponents in Benghazi . `` American military action , international military action has saved an enormous number of lives in the past five days , and that is something that Americans should be very proud of , '' Carney said .

Rebels said they had entered Ajdabiyah from the east , Al Jazeera reported , while Gaddafi 's forces held on in the west of the town , which commands the coastal road toward Tripoli . The African Union said it was planning to facilitate talks to help end the war , but NATO said its operation could last three months , and France said the conflict would not end soon . In Washington , a U.S. military spokeswoman said the coalition fired 16 Tomahawk cruise missiles and flew 153 air sorties in the past 24 hours targeting Gaddafi 's artillery , mechanized forces and command and control infrastructure . Western governments hope the raids , launched on Saturday with the aim of protecting civilians , will shift the balance of power in favor of the Arab world 's most violent popular revolt . In Tripoli , residents reported another air raid just before dawn , hearing the roar of a warplane , followed by a distant explosion and bursts of anti-aircraft gunfire . As the United States said Gaddafi 's ability to command and sustain his forces was diminishing , Libyan state TV said the `` brother leader '' had promoted all members of his armed forces and police `` for their heroic and courageous fight against the crusader , colonialist assault , '' without giving further details . Rebels massing for an attack on Ajdabiyah earlier exchanged artillery fire with Gaddafi 's forces . Opposition forces on the road there seemed more organized than in recent days , when their disarray stirred doubts about their ability to challenge Gaddafi . They had set up road blocks at regular intervals and Reuters counted at least four truck-based rocket launchers -- heavier weaponry than had been seen earlier this week . Winning back Ajdabiyah would be the biggest victory for the eastern rebels since Western military intervention halted a counter-offensive by the better equipped Gaddafi forces which had driven them back toward the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . It would also signal that allied airstrikes may be capable of helping rebel fighters eventually topple Gaddafi . At African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa , AU commission chairman Jean Ping said it was planning to facilitate peace talks in a process that should end with democratic elections . It was the first statement by the AU , which had rejected any form of foreign intervention in the Libya crisis , since the U.N. Security Council imposed a no-fly zone last week and air strikes began on Libyan military targets . But in Brussels , a NATO official said planning for NATO 's operation assumed a mission lasting 90 days , although this could be extended or shortened as required . France said the war could drag on for weeks . `` I doubt that it will be days , '' Admiral Edouard Guillaud , the head of French armed forces , told France Info radio . `` I think it will be weeks . I hope it will not take months . '' Guillaud said a French plane destroyed an army artillery battery near Ajdabiyah , while in London , the Ministry of Defense said British Tornado aircraft had also been active there . A Reuters correspondent who traveled close to Ajdabiyah during the day on Friday saw large plumes of black smoke rising above the eastern entrance to the town . A rocket apparently fired from rebel positions then hit the eastern gate , sending a fireball into the sky . `` The eastern gate has fallen and we are sending a team to check before moving forward , '' rebel Colonel Hamad al-Hasi told Reuters . In Benghazi , rebel spokesman Mustafa Gheriani said he expected Ajdabiyah to fall following the Western strikes . `` This -LRB- the strikes -RRB- will weaken their forces and more importantly their morale , '' he said , adding the level of Western strikes was `` sufficient . We feel safe under their protection . '' Simon Brooks , head of the International Committee of the Red Cross operations in eastern Libya , reported big population movements from the Ajdabiyah area because of the fighting . Officials and rebels said aid organizations were able to deliver some supplies to the western city of Misrata but were concerned because of government snipers in the city center . Gaddafi 's forces shelled an area on the outskirts of the city , killing six people including three children , a rebel said . Misrata has experienced some of the heaviest fighting between rebels and Gaddafi 's forces since an uprising began on February 16 . QATARI PLANE JOINS AIR PATROLS NATO said on Thursday after four days of tough negotiations that it would enforce the no-fly zone but stopped short of taking full command of U.N.-mandated military operations to protect civilians from forces loyal to Gaddafi . Differences over the scope the U.N. resolution gave for military action against Gaddafi 's army led to days of heated arguments within NATO about its role in the operation . The United States , embroiled in Iraq and Afghanistan , is keen to step back and play a supporting role in Libya in order to preserve alliance unity and maintain the support of Muslim countries for the U.N.-mandated intervention . Despite the apparently cumbersome structure of the planned new command and Arab jitters on the use of force , the operation continues to receive support from beyond Western ranks . The United Arab Emirates said it would send 12 planes to take part in operations to enforce the no-fly zone . Qatar has contributed two fighters and two military transport planes . A coalition task force statement said a Qatari Mirage 2000-5 jet joined a French air force plane over Libya on Friday , making it the first Arab country to begin patrolling . Some countries critical of the operation have suggested Western powers had exceeded the U.N. mandate , especially since they have said publicly they would like Gaddafi to go , and also expressed concerns about civilian deaths from air strikes . Libyan officials and hospital workers said civilians , including women , were among those killed in the latest Western air strikes in Tripoli . There was no way to independently verify the report . Security analysts have also warned against the risk of the West becoming embroiled in a lengthy civil war , effectively taking the said of a rebel movement they know little about . British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the West could not be certain of the outcome but told Reuters the risk was justified and that standing aside while Gaddafi 's forces killed civilians would have caused public outrage in Britain . `` No one should think that you can launch a mission like this and be absolutely 100 percent sure what is going to come of this , '' he said . `` There are risks . It is going to be untidy . There are going to be unintended consequences . People have got to accept there is always a degree of uncertainty in these kind of undertakings .

Emboldened by Western-led air strikes against Gaddafi 's troops , rebels took the town of Nawfaliyah and moved toward Sirte , Gaddafi 's home town and an important military base , in the sixth week of an uprising against his 41-year rule . As rebels pressed forward in the east , Gaddafi 's troops were patrolling an area near the center of Misrata after shelling the previously rebel-controlled western city for days and Arab news networks reported Western air strikes in the west of Tripoli . The government in Tripoli said it had `` liberated '' Misrata from rebels and declared a ceasefire there . Diplomatic activity accelerated on the eve of a 35-nation meeting in London on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in the oil-producing North African desert state . Italy proposed a deal including a ceasefire , exile for Gaddafi and dialogue between rebels and tribal leaders . The rebel leadership ruled out compromise with Gaddafi 's followers . `` We have had a vision from the very beginning and the main ingredient of this vision is the downfall of the Gaddafi regime , '' spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in eastern Libya . Qatar became the first Arab country to recognize the rebels as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people , in a move that may presage similar moves from other Gulf states . Libyan state television called the move `` blatant interference '' . Russia criticized the Western intervention that has turned the tide in the conflict , saying it amounted to taking sides in a civil war and breached the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution . U.S. SAYS REBELS NOT ROBUST U.S. Vice Admiral Bill Gortney said on Monday the rebels fighting Gaddafi were not robust and the gains they have made on the battlefield in recent days were tenuous . Gortney , director of the U.S. military 's Joint Staff , said the United States was not directly supporting the opposition but it had achieved a military benefit from coalition air strikes . He said the United States had no confirmed report of any civilian casualty caused by coalition forces and that coalition had fired six Tomahawk cruise missiles in the past 24 hours and had carried out 178 air sorties . The French and British leaders called for supporters of Gaddafi to abandon him and asked Libyans opposing him to join a political process to pave the way for his departure . `` Gaddafi must go immediately , '' President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron said in a joint statement . `` We call on all his supporters to drop him before it is too late . '' In the nine days since the start of the Western-led bombing , the motley volunteer force of rebels has pressed half-way along the coast from its stronghold of Benghazi toward Tripoli and regained control of major oil terminals in the OPEC state . A U.S. Treasury Department official said rebels could sell Libyan crude without being subject to U.S. sanctions if they conducted the transactions outside entities in Gaddafi 's administration subject to sanctions . With its finances under pressure , the rebel leadership said it hopes to restart oil exports within a week . Some energy traders said that , sanctions aside , they could not touch Libyan oil because of shipping and legal risks . On Monday rebels met sporadic resistance as they pushed their advance in convoys of pick-up trucks with machineguns . Just west of sandy , barren Nawfaliyah , bursts of sustained machinegun fire and the whoosh of several rockets could be heard , and plumes of black smoke rose ahead . `` Those are from our guns , '' said Faisal Bozgaia , 28 , a hospital worker turned rebel fighter , pointing to the smoke . Rebels said occasional ambushes by Gaddafi forces had pushed them back but that they later regained their positions . `` We are advancing one , two kilometers at a time , '' rebel Khalif Ali , 22 , said in the town of Harawah , west of Nawfaliyah . But the rapid advance is stretching rebel supply lines . `` We have a serious problem with petrol , '' said a volunteer fighter waiting to fill up in the oil town of Ras Lanuf . Reuters correspondent Michael Georgy , reporting from Sirte to the west , saw police and military but no sign of fighting . Soldiers were manning checkpoints and green Libyan flags flapped in the wind . Militiamen fired AK-47 rifles defiantly into the air . `` If they come to Sirte , we will defend our city , '' said Osama bin Nafaa , 32 , a policeman . In Misrata , Gaddafi soldiers manned checkpoints and took up position on rooftops . Some housefronts were smashed , smoke was rising from several areas and gunfire rang out across the city . Several civilians approached a group of journalists , some of them woman and children waving green flags . `` Misrata is ours , there are still some bad guys in other parts , but Gaddafi is winning , the city is ours , '' resident Abduq Karim said . `` Civilians are happy , '' said an army official who declined to be named . `` Everything you are hearing is a lie . The function of our army is to save the people and to protect the leader . We can not kill our own people . '' A rebel spokesman in another western town , Zintan , said forces loyal to Gaddafi had bombarded the town with rockets early on Monday , Al Jazeera reported . Western-led air strikes began on March 19 , two days after the U.N. Security Council authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . But from the outset , the mission faced questions about its scope and aims , including the extent to which it will actively back the rebel side and whether it might target Gaddafi himself . The start of allied bombings proved a turning point for the rebels who were hemmed into Benghazi at the time . Russia , which abstained in the U.N. vote , said Western attacks on Gaddafi forces amounted to taking sides . `` We consider that intervention by the coalition in what is essentially an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference . NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC : `` We are there to protect civilians -- no more , no less . '' France , which dropped the first bombs of the campaign nine days ago , said the coalition was strictly complying with U.N. terms . It said its warplanes struck a command center south of Tripoli belonging to Gaddafi 's forces on Sunday and Monday . The Defense Ministry in London said British Tornado aircraft destroyed Libyan government ammunition bunkers in the Sabha area of Libya 's southern desert in the early hours of Monday . On Sunday , NATO agreed to take full command of military operations in Libya after a week of heated negotiations . The United States , which led the initial phase , had sought to scale back its role in another Muslim country after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . An alliance spokeswoman said on Monday the transition would take a couple of days . Libya accused NATO of `` terrorizing '' and killing its people as part of a global plot to humiliate and weaken it . A Libyan government spokesman said on Monday night that Western air strikes in Sabha , 700 km -LRB- 420 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , killed 12-13 civilians the night before . Libyan television reported an air strike on Surman , west of Tripoli . The government says the Western-led air attacks have killed more than 100 civilians , a charge denied by the coalition which says it is protecting civilians from Gaddafi forces and targeting only military sites to enforce a no-fly zone . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Gaddafi better listen to the Arab union folks talking to him . He , and his family can still get a good exit deal . A billion bucks , and get back all his property in England . You Fight To Be A Man Your Whole Life , In Order To Protect The Children That You Wish To Be . GOD BLESS YOU ALL .

A conference of 40 governments and international bodies agreed to press on with a NATO-led aerial bombardment of Libyan forces until Gaddafi complied with a U.N. resolution to end violence against civilians . It also set up a contact group comprising 20 countries and organizations , including Arab states , the African Union and the Arab League , to coordinate international support for an orderly transition to democracy in Libya . `` All of us must continue to increase the pressure on and deepen the isolation of the Gaddafi regime through other means as well , '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said after the London talks finished . `` This includes a unified front of political and diplomatic pressure that makes clear to Gaddafi that he must go . '' The United States , Britain and Qatar suggested that Gaddafi and his family could be allowed to go into exile if they took up the offer quickly to end six weeks of bloodshed . Washington and Paris also raised the possibility of arming the rebels , although both stressed no decision had been taken . However , U.S. President Barack Obama told NBC television that he had already agreed to provide aid such as communications equipment , medical supplies and potentially transportation aid to the Libyan opposition , but no military hardware . Without the help of air strikes , the rebels seem unable to make advances or even hold positions , and on the ground the pendulum of fighting swung back Gaddafi 's way . It took five days of foreign air strikes to pulverize Libyan government tanks around the town of Ajdabiyah before Gaddafi 's troops fled and the rebels rushed in and began a 300-km -LRB- 200-mile -RRB- , two-day dash across the desert to within 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- of the Gaddafi loyalist stronghold of Sirte . But the rebel pick-up truck cavalcade was first ambushed , then outflanked by Gaddafi troops . Government forces retook the small town of Nawfaliyah , 120 km -LRB- 75 miles -RRB- east of Sirte , and rebels said they had been pushed back a further 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- to the outskirts of the larger Bin Jawad . `` The Gaddafi guys hit us with Grads -LRB- rockets -RRB- and they came round our flanks , '' Ashraf Mohammed , a 28-year-old rebel wearing a bandolier of bullets , told a Reuters reporter at the front . As the onslaught began , rebels leapt behind sand dunes to fire back . After a few minutes they gave up , jumped into their pick-up trucks and sped off back toward Bin Jawad . Reports that some Nawfaliyah residents fought alongside government troops were an ominous sign for world powers hoping to end Gaddafi 's rule without a descent into all-out civil war . In western Libya , rebels and forces loyal to Gaddafi both claimed control over parts of Misrata , Libya 's third city , which has been besieged by government forces for more than a month . State television said thousands of people were taking part in a march in support of Gaddafi in Misrata , which it said had been `` cleansed of armed terrorist gangs . '' It was the third time the channel said Misrata had been recaptured from rebels . A rebel spokesman called Sami said Gaddafi 's forces had tried to enter the town from the east . `` Fighting is still taking place now . Random bombardment is continuing , '' he told Reuters by telephone from the city . `` The humanitarian situation is catastrophic . There is a shortage of food and medicine . The hospital is no longer able to deal with the situation . '' Aid agencies are increasingly worried about a lack of food and medicines , especially in towns such as Misrata where a siege by Gaddafi 's forces deprives them of access . `` It is difficult to even get water in from wells outside the town because of the positions of the forces , '' said Abdulrahman , a resident of Zintan in the west , cut off by pro-Gaddafi forces . The U.N. refugee agency said it had reports of thousands of families living in makeshift shelters cut off from assistance . Protection of civilians remains the most urgent goal of the air strikes , and British Prime Minister David Cameron accused Gaddafi 's supporters of `` murderous attacks '' on Misrata . A series of powerful explosions rocked Tripoli on Tuesday and state television said several targets in the Libyan capital had come under attack in rare daytime strikes . The Pentagon said 115 strike sorties had been flown against Gaddafi 's forces in the last 24 hours , and 22 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired . The United States is scaling back to a `` supporting role '' to let NATO take full command of the air campaign from U.S. forces on Wednesday , but air strikes by U.S. , French and British planes remain key to smashing Gaddafi 's armor . Obama told NBC that military pressure and international sanctions had `` greatly weakened '' Gaddafi , adding : `` He does not have control over most of Libya at this point . '' Washington says it has seen no evidence of civilian casualties of the bombardment , but Gaddafi accused Western powers of massacres of Libyan civilians in alliance with rebels who he said were al Qaeda members . `` Stop your brutal and unjust attack on our country ... Hundreds of Libyans are being killed because of this bombardment . Massacres are being mercilessly committed against the Libyan people , '' he said in a letter to world leaders . `` We are a people united behind the leadership of the revolution , facing the terrorism of al Qaeda on the one hand and on the other hand terrorism by NATO , which now directly supports al Qaeda , '' Libya 's official news agency quoted him as saying . The rebels deny any al Qaeda links and on Tuesday promised free and fair elections if Gaddafi is forced from power . Admiral James Stavridis , head of U.S. European Command , told the U.S. Senate that intelligence on the rebel forces had shown ` flickers ' of al Qaeda or Hezbollah presence , but no `` detail sufficient to say there is a significant al Qaeda presence . '' Clinton met the opposition Libyan National Council envoy Mahmoud Jebril before the London talks . After the conference , she said a political resolution could include Gaddafi leaving the country , and noted that a U.N. special envoy would visit Tripoli soon to explore that option and urge Gaddafi to implement a real ceasefire . `` As you know there is a lot of reaching out that is occurring , a lot of conversations that are going on , '' she said . `` He will have to make a decision and that decision , so far as we 're aware , has not yet been made . '' Obama once again ruled out sending ground troops to Libya or directly toppling Gaddafi militarily . `` To be blunt , we went down that road in Iraq , '' Obama said in a televised address before the conference . However , the United States and France both said they could consider arming the rebels . `` I 'm not ruling it in , I 'm not ruling it out , '' Obama told NBC . Washington argues that this possibility is covered by the U.N. resolution , but even its allies disagree . `` I remind you it is not part of the U.N. resolution , which France sticks to , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters , `` but we are ready to discuss it with our partners . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Here is what they say above in the artical . `` Russia criticized the Western intervention that has turned the tide in the conflict , saying it amounted to taking sides in a civil war and breached the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution '' . Nato is trying to protect the rebels from getting massacred . Nato is destorying the Airplanes , Tanks , and heavy artillery . It comes down to Nato trying to make it a fair fight . All Russia is afraid of is that once the rebels make Gaddafi leave Libya or they remove him from prower , that Russia wo n't be apart of the winning team an all that comes with saving Arab lives . It will get them good feeling among the Arab League . Can someome tell me how Gaddafi is spelled . I spell it `` Gaddafi '' . I have also seem it spelled `` Kad '' dafy '' Which is the correct spelling for the Libyan Tyrant . @SportsCar39 : Sorry about the meds comment the other day . I 've seen his name spelled 3 or 4 different ways . The most common variation seems to be Kaddafi . I like Al KaDaffy myself . The Russians rate right down there with Kaddafi in my estimation but they make a point . Innocent civilians were protected about day three and a DMZ or free fire zone would have protected civilians from both factions . Providing close air support for the rebels and attacking Libya 's armor and troops all the way back to Surt was not part of Resolution 1973 and the UN Charter prohibits outsiders from from interfering in civil wars . If Obama and the coalition want KaDaffy gone , they could have done it easily enough and no one else in the world is strong enough to do anything about it .

In Libya 's third largest city Misrata , where forces loyal to leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels continue to clash , the main hospital has been inundated with wounded and residents say water supplies and electricity have been cut off . Libyan officials deny deliberately cutting power and water to the city . `` The humanitarian situation is catastrophic . There is a shortage of food and medicine . The hospital is no longer able to deal with the situation , '' Sami , a rebel spokesman , said by telephone . `` We call for urgent help to protect civilians and improve the humanitarian situation . '' Aid agencies , based in the rebel-held east , were able to bring in supplies via Misrata 's Mediterranean port last week but it is uncertain if they can deliver more because control over the port has seesawed between rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces . `` We are very concerned -LRB- about Misrata -RRB- , '' said Eman Moankar , a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross operations in eastern Libya . `` The consequences of this fighting is a worry for us . '' In Zintan , resident Abdulrahman also spoke of shortages as pro-Gaddafi forces remain outside the western Libyan town . `` It is difficult to even get water in from wells outside the town because of the positions of the forces , '' he said . Aid is coming into rebel-held eastern town of Benghazi but with the security situation limiting humanitarian access further west , U.N. aid agencies say they are reviewing conditions and hope to determine the next steps in coming days . `` We are managing to send some supplies in already with the Libyan Red Crescent , of course -LRB- it 's -RRB- only reaching some parts of the country , '' Melissa Fleming of the U.N. refugee agency said . `` Of course cities under siege or Gaddafi control are not being reached . '' She said the UNHCR had reports of a lot of internal displacement , with thousands of families living in makeshift shelters cut off from any kind of assistance . The U.N. World Food Programme said it was concerned about food shortages in the country . `` Libya depends on food imports , '' said spokeswoman Reem Nada , speaking from the Libyan-Tunisian border . `` Supplies are being cut off , stocks are depleting . '' The World Health Organization , present at the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , has propositioned drugs and medical equipment there . `` As soon as we have access to Libya , as other U.N. agencies , we will help in providing these drugs to centers and hospitals , '' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said . In the capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's main power base , residents are also facing tough conditions . Prices have soared , basic items such as milk and cooking gas have grown scarce , and people must spend hours queuing as the war hits daily life . `` Tripoli is suffering , '' a resident , who did not want to be identified , said by phone . `` This is the life in Tripoli . It 's getting worse every day . '' Shop shelves have fast emptied and gas canisters as well as electric hot plates to warm coffee and tea without using gas have become scarce . `` Most of the products have now disappeared , children 's milk , for example , '' he said . As residents have rushed to stock up for what international observers say could be weeks or months of war , some have hoarded supplies , resulting in steep price hikes . `` Most of the commodities like oil , the basic needs , prices are increasing , '' the resident said . `` For example , we used to buy one can of oil for cars , it used to cost 1.25 dinars , now it costs almost five dinars . When you come to cooking oil , it 's also double the price . '' `` If you want to buy it you have to go early , maybe you will find it , maybe you wo n't . People are very frightened so they store these things in their house , and some they store and sell for double the prices . '' As is typical in an economy of shortage , especially in a country under international embargo , Libyans must spend hours in line to obtain basic goods . Adding to the difficulties are shorter store hours than usual . `` There are very big queues in the banks and sometimes they do n't have currency . So they have queues in the banks , queues in the gas stations , queues in the shops , '' the resident said . Libyan national television has said little about the hardships of current daily life , showing mainly pro-Gaddafi rallies and events for many hours of its broadcast day . Shokri Ghanem , the chairman of Libya 's National Oil Corporation , said on Tuesday oil output had `` dramatically declined '' and that there was a petrol shortage . `` There is a crisis because of what is happening in Libya . I hope there will be a solution soon , '' he said on state TV . `` Many oil fields have halted because the foreign work force left the country .

Full Article Rebels push west before Libya crisis talks NAWFALIYAH\\/MISRATA , Libya | Tue Mar 29 , 2011 12:20 am IST NAWFALIYAH\\/MISRATA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels advanced west towards the birthplace of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Monday , firing mortars and heavy machineguns in sporadic clashes with loyalist forces . Emboldened by Western-led air strikes against Gaddafi 's troops , the rebels took the town of Nawfaliyah and moved towards Sirte , Gaddafi 's home town and an important military base , in the sixth week of an uprising against his 41-year rule . As the rebels pressed forward in the east , Gaddafi 's troops were patrolling an area near the center of Misrata after shelling the previously rebel-controlled western city for days . The government in Tripoli said it had `` liberated '' Misrata from rebels and declared a ceasefire there . Diplomatic activity accelerated on the eve of a 35-nation meeting in London on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in the oil-producing North African country . Italy proposed a deal including a ceasefire , exile for Gaddafi and dialogue between rebels and tribal leaders . The rebel leadership ruled out compromise with Gaddafi 's followers . `` We have had a vision from the very beginning and the main ingredient of this vision is the downfall of the Gaddafi regime , '' spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . Qatar became the first Arab country to recognize the rebels as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people . Libyan state television called the move `` blatant interference '' . Russia criticised the Western intervention that has turned the tide in the conflict , saying it amounted to taking sides in a civil war and breached the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution . The French and British leaders called for supporters of Gaddafi to abandon him and asked Libyans opposing him to join a political process to pave the way for his departure . `` Gaddafi must go immediately , '' President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron said in a joint statement . `` We call on all his supporters to drop him before it is too late . '' In the nine days since the start of the Western-led bombing , the motley volunteer force of rebels has pressed half-way along the coast from its stronghold of Benghazi towards the capital Tripoli and regained control of most major oil terminals in the OPEC member state . A U.S. Treasury Department official said the rebels could sell Libyan crude without being subject to U.S. sanctions if they conducted the transactions outside the National Oil Corporation and other entities in Gaddafi 's administration subject to sanctions . With its finances under pressure , the rebel leadership said it hopes to restart oil exports within a week . Some energy traders said that , sanctions aside , they could not touch Libyan oil because of shipping and legal risks . On Monday the rebels met sporadic resistance as they continued their advance in convoys of pick-up trucks with machineguns mounted on them . Just west of sandy , barren Nawfaliyah , bursts of sustained machinegun fire and the whoosh of several rockets could be heard , and plumes of black smoke rose ahead . `` Those are from our guns , '' said Faisal Bozgaia , 28 , a hospital worker turned rebel fighter , pointing to the smoke . Rebels said occasional ambushes by Gaddafi forces had pushed them back but that they later regained their positions . `` We are advancing one , two kilometres at a time , '' rebel Khalif Ali , 22 , said in the town of Harawah , west of Nawfaliyah . But the rapid advance is stretching rebel supply lines . `` We have a serious problem with petrol , '' said a volunteer fighter waiting to fill up in the oil town of Ras Lanuf . Reuters correspondent Michael Georgy , reporting from Sirte to the west , said he saw police and military but no sign of fighting . Soldiers were manning checkpoints and green Libyan flags flapped in the wind . Militiamen fired AK-47 rifles defiantly into the air . `` If they come to Sirte , we will defend our city , '' said Osama bin Nafaa , 32 , a policeman . In Misrata , Gaddafi soldiers manned checkpoints and took up position on rooftops . Some housefronts were smashed , smoke was rising from several areas and gunfire rang out constantly across the city . Several civilians approached a group of journalists , some of them woman and children waving green flags . `` Civilians are happy , '' said an army official who declined to be named . `` Everything you are hearing is a lie . The function of our army is to save the people and to protect the leader . We can not kill our own people . '' A rebel spokesman in another western town , Zintan , said forces loyal to Gaddafi had bombarded the town with rockets early on Monday , Al Jazeera reported . Western-led air strikes began on March 19 , two days after the U.N. Security Council authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . But from the outset , the mission has faced questions about its scope and aims , including the extent to which it will actively back the rebel side and whether it might target Gaddafi himself . The start of allied bombings proved a turning point for the rebels who were hemmed into Benghazi at the time . Russia , which abstained in the U.N. vote , said Western attacks on Gaddafi 's forces amounted to taking sides . `` We consider that intervention by the coalition in what is essentially an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference . NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC : `` We are there to protect civilians -- no more , no less . '' France , which dropped the first bombs of the campaign nine days ago , said the coalition was strictly complying with U.N. terms . It said its planes struck a command center south of Tripoli belonging to Gaddafi 's forces on Sunday and Monday . The Defense Ministry in London said British Tornado aircraft destroyed Libyan government ammunition bunkers in the Sabha area of Libya 's southern desert in the early hours of Monday . `` He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is still capable ... of inflicting further great bloodshed on the people of his own country . So we must maintain our efforts absolutely in line with international law , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague told BBC television . On Sunday , NATO agreed to take full command of military operations in Libya after a week of heated negotiations . The United States , which led the initial phase , had sought to scale back its role in another Muslim country after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . An alliance spokeswoman said on Monday the transition would take a couple of days . Libya accused NATO of `` terrorising '' and killing its people as part of a global plot to humiliate and weaken it . The government says the Western-led air attacks have killed more than 100 civilians , a charge denied by the coalition which says it is protecting civilians from Gaddafi 's forces and targeting only military sites to enforce a no-fly zone .

Obama signed the order , known as a presidential `` finding '' , within the last two or three weeks , according to government sources familiar with the matter . Such findings are a principal form of presidential directive used to authorize secret operations by the Central Intelligence Agency . This is a necessary legal step before such action can take place but does not mean that it will . As is common practice for this and all administrations , I am not going to comment on intelligence matters , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement . `` I will reiterate what the president said yesterday -- no decision has been made about providing arms to the opposition or to any group in Libya . '' News that Obama had given the authorization surfaced as the President and other U.S. and allied officials spoke openly about the possibility of sending arms supplies to Gaddafi 's opponents , who are fighting better-equipped government forces . The United States is part of a coalition , with NATO members and some Arab states , which is conducting air strikes on Libyan government forces under a U.N. mandate aimed at protecting civilians opposing Gaddafi . Interviews by U.S. networks on Tuesday , Obama said the objective was for Gaddafi to `` ultimately step down '' from power . He spoke of applying `` steady pressure , not only militarily but also through these other means '' to force Gaddafi out . Obama said the U.S. had not ruled out providing military hardware to rebels . `` It 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could . We 're looking at all our options at this point , '' he told ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer . In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted to reporters that no decision had yet been taken . U.S. officials monitoring events in Libya say neither Gaddafi 's forces nor the rebels , who have asked the West for heavy weapons , now appear able to make decisive gains . While U.S. and allied airstrikes have seriously damaged Gaddafi 's military forces and disrupted his chain of command , officials say , rebel forces remain disorganized and unable to take full advantage of western military support . People familiar with U.S. intelligence procedures said that Presidential covert action `` findings '' are normally crafted to provide broad authorization for a range of potential U.S. government actions to support a particular covert objective . In order for specific operations to be carried out under the provisions of such a broad authorization -- for example the delivery of cash or weapons to anti-Gaddafi forces -- the White House also would have to give additional `` permission '' allowing such activities to proceed . Former officials say these follow-up authorizations are known in the intelligence world as '' ` Mother may I ' findings . '' In 2009 Obama gave a similar authorization for the expansion of covert U.S. counter-terrorism actions by the CIA in Yemen . The White House does not normally confirm such orders have been issued . Because U.S. and allied intelligence agencies still have many questions about the identities and leadership of anti-Gaddafi forces , any covert U.S. activities are likely to proceed cautiously until more information about the rebels can be collected and analyzed , officials said . `` The whole issue on -LRB- providing rebels with -RRB- training and equipment requires knowing who the rebels are , '' said Bruce Riedel , a former senior CIA Middle East expert who has advised the Obama White House . Riedel said that helping the rebels to organize themselves and training them how use weapons effectively would be more urgent then shipping them arms . Sending in weapons would arguably violate an arms embargo on Libya by the U.N. Security Council imposed on February 26 , although British , U.S. and French officials have suggested there may be a loophole . Getting a waiver would require the agreement of all 15 council members , which is unlikely at this stage . Diplomats say any countries that decided to arm the rebels would be unlikely to seek formal council approval . An article in early March on the website of the Voice of America , the U.S. government 's broadcasting service , speculated on possible secret operations in Libya and defined a covert action as `` any U.S. government effort to change the economic , military , or political situation overseas in a hidden way . '' The article , by VOA intelligence correspondent Gary Thomas , said covert action `` can encompass many things , including propaganda , covert funding , electoral manipulation , arming and training insurgents , and even encouraging a coup . '' U.S. officials also have said that Saudi Arabia and Qatar , whose leaders despise Gaddafi , have indicated a willingness to supply Libyan rebels with weapons . Members of Congress have expressed anxiety about U.S. government activities in Libya . Some have recalled that weapons provided by the U.S. and Saudis to mujahedeen fighting Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s later ended up in the hands of anti-American militants . There are fears that the same thing could happen in Libya unless the U.S. is sure who it is dealing with . The chairman of the House intelligence committee , Rep. Mike Rogers , said on Wednesday he opposed supplying arms to the Libyan rebels fighting Gaddafi `` at this time . '' `` We need to understand more about the opposition before I would support passing out guns and advanced weapons to them , '' Rogers said in a statement .

Or maybe his goal is food riots , reduction of large parts of major cities to rubble , and a cart load of dollar bills for a loaf of bread to make a socialist take over easier ...

Aided by Western air strikes , rebels had made a two-day charge along more than 200 km -LRB- 125 mile -RRB- of barren coast and seized strategic oil terminals . They have now retreated , giving up gains to Gaddafi 's better armed troops . The failure of the rebels to hold ground and put pressure on Gaddafi , despite more than 10 days of Western-led air strikes , is likely to unsettle the United States , Britain , France and others who want to see the Libyan leader step down . Hundreds of rebel pick-ups mounted with machine guns and other vehicles streamed east of Brega with little sign of order , heading toward Ajdabiyah , a town that rebels took five days to retake from Gaddafi even after air strikes were launched . `` We are going to Ajdabiyah , '' said rebel fighter Mohamed al-Abreigi . `` We will gather there and , God willing , we will head back to Brega today . '' Dozens of rebel vehicles gathered at the western gate to Ajdabiyah , a town which lies about 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . But rebels did not seem to be regrouping into defensive positions there . One man in military fatigues shouted : `` Civilians inside , civilians inside . '' When asked what was happening , one rebel said : `` We do n't know . They say there may be a group -LRB- from Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- coming from the south . '' To the south is open desert . Ajdabiyah , battered by the to-and-fro of fighting , stands at the gateway to the rebel held east of Libya . It is located on a key junction with one route heading to Benghazi and another northeast to the oil port of Tobruk near the Egyptian border . Libyan families were fleeing north to Benghazi as news of the retreat spread . The road out of Ajdabiyah was packed with cars carrying families and their belongings . Rebels had advanced beyond the coastal town of Bin Jawad , about 525 km -LRB- 330 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli . But as they approached Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte , they came up against the Libyan leader 's heavier weaponry . `` Gaddafi 's forces have Grad -LRB- rockets -RRB- which have a range of 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- ... If we had Grads we could liberate Libya in a day , '' said rebel fighter Ezzedine Saleh . Another fighter , Muftah Mohammed , told Reuters : `` Kalashnikovs , RPGs -LRB- rocket-propelled grenades -RRB- and light rockets -- these are our weapons . '' Rebels regularly appeal for better weapons from the West and more air strikes . But even some members of the rebel movement have admitted that one of the biggest challenges is keeping discipline in their enthusiastic but inexperienced force . Few rebel fighters have much formal military training . They have proved keen to race to the front but equally swift to fall back with little sign of order when big guns fire at them . Their own weapons offer little to block Gaddafi 's advance . `` Where is the French air force ? We wo n't be able to get to Sirte except with help from the French air force , '' said rebel Rafa Abbas near Ras Lanuf , moments before aircraft roared overhead . A series of loud booms followed . A rebel fighter , Ahmed , returning from Ras Lanuf , told Reuters : `` The French planes came and bombed Gaddafi 's forces . '' But the apparent aerial attack showed no sign of slowing down Gaddafi 's advance or halting the pace of the rebel retreat . Some 10-15 km -LRB- 6-10 miles -RRB- west of Brega , around a dozen rebel fighters stopped by the road and trained their guns south into the Sahara . Wisps of smoke could be seen in the distance . `` They -LRB- Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- are coming from the desert , '' yelled one fighter . Another fired his Kalashnikov rifle in the air to scare away a group of camels . There was no sign of the rebels forming any determined defense of the sprawling oil town of Brega . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The fact is that a substantial number of the rebels will include jihadist agitators -LRB- assuming U.S. intel has not relied entirely on Gaddafi 's claims over the past few years -RRB- who have encouraged , supported , incited and even spearheaded the revolution , and will not be without honor in any new government that the West will have to deal with . How does one arrange security and intel with a future government whose security includes Al Qaida or jihadist moles and even open sympathizers ? John McCain might want also to consider mission-creep against forces that know how to make strategic retreats , how to ambush , how to cache and deploy heavy arms in and around cities -LRB- and just how much they have cached -RRB- , inaccessible to air strikes , how well motivated G 's forces really are , etc. . The U.N. has fashioned a general economic noose for G. , the coalition is striking systematically at his forces ' materiel , and there is no turning back . But there is no reason to ramp it up either . This is a war of attrition , nothing more , nothing less . There has been way too much talking by the coalition diplomats when the Libyan rebels need air power , long range artillery\\/rockets , and tanks . Are all these US and NATO Politicians and Military general completely STUPID . Common sense appears in very short supply . A civil war is raging in Libya . Gadhafi has a trained military army . The rebels have no trained military army . WE can knock out all Gadhafi 's air power etc but that still leaves his ground soldiers . And UN 1970 resolution is to protect civilians only . So how do you stop Gadhafi troops when they enter cities without us killing civilians . Answer you need to put `` boots on the ground '' to fight Gadhafi troops and then we have another IRAQ to suck up lives and squander tax dollars . And the UN resolution 1970 is ignored . Has anyone learned any lessons ... . And remember there are 6 or 7 dictators in countries around Libya who crush their people , so will we bomb them also . These med-evil countries live by the Sharia Law and have been killing each other for centuries . They are not going to stop . We should get the hell out , and let them murder one another .

It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . PARIS | Fri Apr 1 , 2011 9:14 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . Only Nicolas Sarkozy saw the popular revolt that began in Libya on February 15 as an opportunity for political and diplomatic redemption . Whether the French president 's energetic leadership of an international coalition to protect the Libyan people from Muammar Gaddafi will be enough to revive his sagging domestic fortunes in next year 's election is highly uncertain . But by pushing for military strikes that he hopes might repair France 's reputation in the Arab world , Sarkozy helped shape what type of war it would be . The road to Western military intervention was paved with mutual suspicion , fears of another quagmire in a Muslim country and doubts about the largely unknown ragtag Libyan opposition with which the West has thrown in its lot . That will make it harder to hold together an uneasy coalition of Americans , Europeans and Arabs , the longer Gaddafi holds out . Almost two weeks into the air campaign , Western policymakers fret about the risk of a stray bomb hitting a hospital or an orphanage , or of the conflict sliding into a prolonged stalemate . There is no doubt the outcome in Tripoli will have a bearing on the fate of the popular movement for change across the Arab world . But because this war was born in Paris it will also have consequences for Europe . `` It 's high time that Europeans stopped exporting their own responsibilities to Washington , '' says Nick Witney , a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations . `` If the West fails in Libya , it will be primarily a European failure . '' When the first Arab pro-democracy uprisings shook the thrones of aging autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt in January , France had got itself on the wrong side of history . Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie had enjoyed a winter holiday in Tunisia , a former French colony , oblivious to the rising revolt . She and her family had taken free flights on the private jet of a businessman close to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , and then publicly offered the government French assistance with riot control just a few days before Ben Ali was ousted by popular protests . Worse was to come . It turned out that French Prime Minister Francois Fillon had spent his Christmas vacation up the Nile as the guest of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the next autocrat in the Arab democracy movement 's firing line , while Sarkozy and his wife Carla had soaked up the winter sunshine in Morocco , another former French territory ruled by a barely more liberal divine-right monarch . Television stations were re-running embarrassing footage of the president giving Gaddafi a red-carpet welcome in Paris in 2007 , when Libya 's `` brother leader '' planted his tent in the grounds of the Hotel de Marigny state guest house across the road from the Elysee presidential palace . On February 27 , a few days after Libyan rebels hoisted the pre-Gaddafi tricolor flag defiantly in Benghazi , Sarkozy fired his foreign minister . In a speech announcing the appointment of Alain Juppe as her successor , Sarkozy cited the need to adapt France 's foreign and security policy to the new situation created by the Arab uprisings . `` This is an historic change , '' he said . `` We must not be afraid of it . We must have one sole aim : to accompany , support and help the people who have chosen freedom . '' MAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT Yet the international air campaign against Gaddafi 's forces might never have happened without the self-appointed activism of French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy , a left-leaning philosopher and talk-show groupie , who lobbied Sarkozy to take up the cause of Libya 's pro-democracy rebels . Libya was the latest of a string of international causes that the libertarian icon with his unbuttoned white designer shirts and flowing mane of greying hair has championed over the last two decades after Bosnian Muslims , Algerian secularists , Afghan rebels and Georgia 's side in the conflict with Russia . Levy went to meet the Libyan rebels and telephoned Sarkozy from Benghazi in early March . `` I 'd like to bring you the Libyan Massouds , '' Levy says he told the president , comparing the anti-Gaddafi opposition with former Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud , who fought against the Islamist Taliban before being assassinated . `` As Gaddafi only clings on through violence , I think he 'll collapse , '' the philosopher told Reuters in an interview . On March 10 , Levy accompanied two envoys of the Libyan Transitional Council to Sarkozy 's office . To their surprise and to the consternation of France 's allies , the president recognized the council as the `` legitimate representative of the Libyan people '' and told them he favored not only establishing a no-fly zone to protect them but also carrying out `` limited targeted strikes '' against Gaddafi 's forces . In doing so without consultation on the eve of a European Union summit called to discuss Libya , Sarkozy upstaged Washington , which was still debating what to do , embarrassed London , which wanted broad support for a no-fly zone , and infuriated Berlin , France 's closest European partner . He also stunned his own foreign minister , who learned about the decision to recognize the opposition from a news agency dispatch , aides said , while in Brussels trying to coax the EU into backing a no-fly zone . `` Quite a lot of members of the European Council were irritated to discover that France had recognized the Libyan opposition council and the Elysee was talking of targeted strikes , '' a senior European diplomat said . Across the Channel , British Prime Minister David Cameron , aware of the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war , had turned his back on Tony Blair 's doctrine of liberal interventionism when he took office in 2010 . But after facing criticism over the slow evacuation of British nationals from Libya and a trade-promotion trip to the Gulf in the midst of the Arab uprisings , he overruled cabinet skeptics , military doubters and critics among his own Conservative lawmakers to join Sarkozy in campaigning for military action . However , Cameron sought to reassure parliament that he was not entering an Iraq-style open-ended military commitment . `` This is different to Iraq . This is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' he said . In Britain , as in France , the government won bipartisan support for intervention . In Germany , on the other hand , the Libyan uprising was an unwelcome distraction from domestic politics . It played directly into the campaign for regional elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg , a south-western state which Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats had governed since 1953 . Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle , leader of the Free Democrats , the liberal junior partners in Merkel 's coalition , tried to surf on pacifist public opinion by opposing military action . Polls showed two-thirds of voters opposed German involvement in Libya , a country where Nazi Germany 's Afrika Korps had suffered desert defeats in World War Two . Present-day Germany 's armed forces were already overstretched in Afghanistan , where some 5,000 soldiers are engaged in an unpopular long-term mission . Westerwelle made it impossible for Merkel to support a no-fly zone , even without participating . He publicly criticized the Franco-British proposal for a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to prevent Gaddafi using his air force against Libyan civilians . Merkel said she was skeptical . The Germans prevented a March 11 EU summit from making any call for a no-fly zone , much to the frustration of the French and British . Relations between France 's Juppe and Westerwelle deteriorated further the following week when Germany prevented foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized powers from calling for a no-fly zone in Libya . Westerwelle told reporters : `` Military intervention is not the solution . From our point of view , it is very difficult and dangerous . We do not want to get sucked into a war in North Africa . We would not like to step on a slippery slope where we all are at the end in a war . '' That argument angered allies . As the meeting broke up , a senior European diplomat tells Reuters , Juppe turned to Westerwelle and said : `` Now that you have achieved everything you wanted , Gaddafi can go ahead and massacre his people . '' When the issue came to the U.N. Security Council on March 17 , 10 days before the Baden-Wuerttemberg election , Germany abstained , along with Russia , China , India and Brazil , and said it would take no part in military operations . Ironically , that stance seems to have been politically counterproductive . The center-right coalition lost the regional election anyway , and both leaders were severely criticized by German media for having isolated Germany from its western partners , including the United States . The main political beneficiaries were the ecologist Greens , seen as both anti-nuclear and anti-war . In Washington , meanwhile , President Barack Obama was , as usual , taking his time to make up his mind . Military action in Libya was the last thing the U.S. president needed , just when he was trying to extricate American troops from two unpopular wars in Muslim countries launched by his predecessor , George W. Bush . Obama had sought to rebuild damaged relations with the Muslim world , seen as a key driver of radicalization and terrorism against the United States . The president trod a fine line in embracing pro-democracy and reform movements in the Arab world and Iran while trying to avoid undermining vital U.S. interests in the absolute monarchies of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and other Gulf states . Compared to those challenges , Libya was a sideshow . The United States had no big economic or political interests in the North African oil and gas producing state and instinctively saw it as part of Europe 's backyard . Obama had also sought to encourage allies , notably in Europe , to take more responsibility for their own security issues . Spelling out the administration 's deep reluctance to get dragged into another potential Arab quagmire , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a farewell speech to officer cadets at the West Point military academy on March 4 : `` In my opinion , any future Defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should ` have his head examined ' , as General -LRB- Douglas -RRB- MacArthur so delicately put it . '' Prominent U.S. foreign policy lawmakers , including Democratic Senator John Kerry and Republican Senator John McCain pressed the Obama administration in early March to impose a `` no - fly '' zone over Libya and explore other military options , such as bombing runways . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had said after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on February 28 that a `` no-fly '' zone was `` an option which we are actively considering '' . But the White House pushed back against pressure from lawmakers . `` It would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said on March 7 . `` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing . '' While Carney said a no-fly zone was a serious option , other U.S. civilian and military officials cautioned that it would be difficult to enforce . On March 10 , U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper forecast in Congress that Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces would prevail in the long term , saying Gaddafi appeared to be `` hunkering down for the duration '' . If there was to be intervention , it had become clear , it would have to come quickly . U.S. officials say the key event that helped Clinton and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , persuade Obama of the need for intervention was a March 12 decision by the Arab League to ask the U.N. Security Council to declare a no-fly zone to protect the Libyan population . The Arab League 's unprecedented resolve -- the organization has long been plagued by chronic divisions and a lack of spine -- reflected the degree to which Gaddafi had alienated his peers , especially Saudi Arabia . When the quixotic colonel bothered to attend Arab summits , it was usually to insult the Saudi king and other veteran rulers . The Arab League decision gave a regional seal of approval that Western nations regarded as vital for military action . Moreover , two Arab states - Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - soon said they would participate in enforcing a no-fly zone , and a third , Lebanon , co-sponsored a United Nations resolution to authorize the use of force . Arab diplomats said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa , a former Egyptian foreign minister with presidential ambitions , played the key role in squeezing an agreement out of the closed-door meeting . Syria , Sudan , Algeria and Yemen were all against any move to invite foreign intervention in an Arab state . But diplomats said that by couching the resolution as an appeal to the U.N. Security Council , Moussa maneuvered his way around Article VI of the Arab League 's statutes requiring that such decisions be taken unanimously . It was he who announced the outcome , saying Gaddafi 's government had lost legitimacy because of its `` crimes against the Libyan people '' . The African Union , in which Gaddafi played an active but idiosyncratic role , condemned the Libyan leader 's crackdown but rejected foreign military intervention and created a panel of leaders to try to resolve the conflict through dialogue . However , all three African states on the Security Council - South Africa , Nigeria and Gabon - voted for the resolution . France acted as if it had AU support anyway . Sarkozy invited the organization 's secretary-general , Jean Ping , to the Elysee palace for a showcase summit of coalition countries on the day military action began , and he attended , providing African political cover for the operation . Having failed to win either EU or G8 backing for a no-fly zone , and with the United States internally divided and holding back , France and Britain were in trouble in their quest for a U.N. resolution despite the Arab League support . Gaddafi 's forces had regrouped and recaptured a swathe of the western and central coastal plain , including some key oil terminals , and were advancing fast on Benghazi , a city of 700,000 and the rebels ' stronghold . If international intervention did not come within days , it would be too late . Gaddafi 's troops would be in the population centers , making surgical air strikes impossible without inflicting civilian casualties . In the nick of time , Obama came off the fence on March 15 at a two-part meeting of his National Security Council . Hillary Clinton participated by telephone from Paris , Susan Rice by secure video link from New York . Both were deeply aware of the events of the 1990s , when Bill Clinton 's administration , in which Rice was an adviser on Africa , had failed to prevent genocide in Rwanda , and only intervened in Bosnia after the worst massacre in Europe since World War Two . They reviewed what was at stake now . There were credible reports that Gaddafi forces were preparing to massacre the rebels . What signal would it send to Arab democrats if the West let him get away with that , and if Mubarak and Ben Ali , whose armies refused to turn their guns on the people , were overthrown while Gaddafi , who had used his airforce , tanks and artillery against civilian protesters , survived in office ? The president overruled doubters among his military and national security advisers and decided the United States would support an ambitious U.N. resolution going beyond just a no-fly zone , on the strict condition that Washington would quickly hand over leadership of the military action to its allies . `` Within days , not weeks , '' one participant quoted him as saying . A senior administration official , speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity , said the key concern was to avoid any impression that the United States was once again unilaterally bombing an Arab country . Asked what had swung Washington toward agreeing to join military action in Libya , he said : `` It 's more that events were evolving and so positions had to address the change of events . '' `` The key elements were the Arab League statement , the Lebanese support , co-sponsorship of the actual resolution as the Arab representative on the Security Council , a series of conversations with Arab leaders over the course of that week , leading up to the resolution . All of that convinced us that the Arab countries were fully supportive of the broad resolution that would provide the authorization necessary to protect civilians and to provide humanitarian relief , and then the -LRB- March 19 -RRB- gathering in Paris , confirmed that there was support for the means necessary to carry out the resolution , namely the use of military force , '' the official said . When Rice told her French and British counterparts at the United Nations that Washington now favored a far more aggressive Security Council resolution , including air and sea strikes , they first feared a trap . Was Obama deliberately trying to provoke a Russian veto , a French official mused privately . `` I had a phone call from Susan Rice , Tuesday 8 p.m. , and a phone call from Susan Rice at 11 p.m. , and everything had changed in three hours , '' a senior Western envoy told Reuters . `` On Wednesday morning , at the -LRB- Security -RRB- Council , in a sort of totally awed silence , Susan Rice said : ` We want to be allowed to strike Libyan forces on the ground . ' There was a sort of a bit surprised silence . '' Right up to the day of the vote , when Juppe took a plane to New York to swing vital votes behind the resolution , Moscow 's attitude was uncertain . So too were the three African votes . British and French diplomats tried desperately to contact the Nigerian , South African and Gabonese ambassadors but kept being told they were in a meeting . `` There was drama right up to the last minute , '' another U.N. diplomat said . That day , March 17 , Clinton had just come out of a television studio in Tunis , epicenter of the first Arab democratic revolution , when she spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on a secure cellphone . Lavrov , who had strongly opposed a no-fly zone when they met in Geneva on February 28 and remained skeptical when they talked again in Paris on March 14 , told her Moscow would not block the resolution . The senior U.S. official denied that Washington had offered Russia trade and diplomatic benefits in return for acquiescence , as suggested by a senior non-American diplomat . However , Obama telephoned President Dimitry Medvedev the following week and reaffirmed his support for Russia 's bid to join the World Trade Organization , which U.S. ally Georgia is blocking . China too abstained , allowing the resolution to pass with 10 votes in favor , five abstentions and none against . It authorized the use of `` all necessary measures '' - code for military action -- to protect the civilian population but expressly ruled out a foreign occupation force in any part of Libya . The United States construes it to allow arms sales to the rebels . Most others do not . Reuters reported exclusively on March 29 that Obama had signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel forces . The White House and the Central Intelligence Agency declined comment . Clinton said no decision had been taken on whether to arm the rebels . No sooner had the first cruise missiles been fired than the Arab League 's Moussa complained that the Western powers had gone beyond the U.N. resolution and caused civilian casualties . His outburst appeared mainly aimed at assuaging Arab public opinion , particularly in Egypt , and he muted his criticism after telephone calls from Paris , London and Washington . Turkey , the leading Muslim power in NATO with big economic interests in Libya , bitterly criticized the military action in an Islamic country . The Turks were exasperated to see France , the most vociferous adversary of its EU membership bid , leading the coalition . Sarkozy , who alternated on a brief maiden visit to Ankara on February 25 between trying to sell Turkish leaders French nuclear power plants and telling them bluntly to drop their EU ambitions , further angered Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan by failing to invite Turkey to the Paris conference on Libya . Italy , the former colonial power which had Europe 's biggest trade and investment ties with Libya , had publicly opposed military action until the last minute , but opened its air bases to coalition forces as soon as the U.N. resolution passed . However , Rome quickly demanded that NATO , in which it had a seat at the decision-making table , should take over command of the whole operation . Foreign Minister Franco Frattini threatened to take back control of the vital Italian bases unless the mission was placed under NATO . But Turkey and France were fighting diplomatic dogfights at NATO headquarters . Ankara wanted to use its NATO veto put the handcuffs on the coalition to stop offensive operations . France wanted to keep political leadership away from the U.S.-led military alliance to avoid a hostile reaction in the Arab world . The United States signaled its determination to hand over operational command within days , not weeks , as Obama had promised , and wanted tried-and-trusted NATO at the wheel . It took a week of wrangling before agreement was reached for NATO to take charge of the entire military campaign . In return , France won agreement to create a `` contact group '' including Arab and African partners , to coordinate political efforts on Libya 's future . Turkey was assuaged by being invited to a London international conference that launched that process . That enabled the United States to lower its profile and Obama to declare that Washington would not act alone as the world 's policeman `` wherever repression occurs '' . While the president promised to scale back U.S. involvement to a `` supporting role '' , the military statistics tell a different tale . As of March 29 , the United States had fired all but 7 of the 214 cruise missiles used in the conflict and flown 1,103 sorties compared to 669 for all other allies combined . It also dropped 455 of the first 600 bombs , according to the Pentagon . For all the showcasing of Arab involvement , only six military aircraft from Qatar had arrived in theater by March 30 . They joined French air patrols but did not fly combat missions , a military source said . Sarkozy announced that the United Arab Emirates would send 12 F16 fighters , but NATO and UAE officials refused to say when they would arrive . Britain 's Cameron spoke of unspecified logistical contributions from Kuwait and Jordan . The main Arab contribution is clearly political cover rather than military assets . While the duration and the outcome of the war remain uncertain , some political casualties are already visible . Unless the conflict ends in disaster , Germany and its chancellor and foreign minister - particularly the latter - are set to emerge as losers . `` I can tell you there are people in London and Paris who are asking themselves whether this Germany is the kind of country we would like to have as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council . That 's a legitimate question which was n't posed before , '' a senior European diplomat told Reuters . German officials brush aside such talk , saying Berlin would have the backing of its western partners and needs support from developing and emerging countries more in tune with its abstention on the Libya resolution . Merkel has moved quickly to try to limit the damage . She attended the Paris conference and went along with an EU summit statement on March 25 welcoming the U.N. resolution on which her own government had abstained a week earlier . She also offered NATO extra help in aerial surveillance in Afghanistan to free up Western resources for the Libya campaign . A second conspicuous casualty has been the European Union 's attempt to build a common foreign , security and Defense policy , and the official meant to personify that ambition , High Representative Catherine Ashton . Many in Paris , London , Brussels and Washington have drawn the conclusion that European Defense is an illusion , given Germany 's visceral reticence about military action . Future serious operations are more likely to be left to NATO , or to coalitions of the willing around Britain and France . By general agreement , Ashton has so far had a bad war . Despite having been among the first European officials to embrace the Arab uprisings and urge the EU to engage with democracy movements in North Africa , she angered both the British and French by airing her doubts about a no-fly zone and the Germans by subsequently welcoming the U.N. resolution . Unable to please everyone , she managed to please no one . As for Sarkozy , whether he emerges as a hero or a reckless adventurer may depend on events beyond his control in the sands of Libya . Justin Vaisse , a Frenchman who heads the Center for the Study of the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington , detected an undertone of `` Francophobia and Sarkophobia '' among U.S. policy elites as the war began . `` Either the war will go well , and he will look like a far-sighted , decisive leader , or it will go badly and reinforce the image of a showboating cowboy driving the world into war , '' Vaisse said .

Once upon a time , a market seller in Tunisia set fire to ... the Arab order , NATO , European unity , US politics , ... Big fuel buildup problem if you are a firefighter . I now pity the rebels in Libya . They are needing to rely now on the same Europe that could n't even defend its own territory in two World Wars without a massive American commitment , and which needded U. S. military punch even to settle the conflict the Balkansafter European soldiers stood by during masacres . Perhaps the rebels should have learned a lesson from Croatia after it got its no fly zone and built an Army before trying to take back the rest of their nation . I hope the rebels win and do in fact create a democracy in Libya , but the way the Syrian dictator is acting , he no longer fears a successful revolt in his nation . Gaddafi is showing that guns for hire do work . I just wonder why the rebels have n't also hired mercenaries to form a leadership cohort in conjunction with the soldiers who switched to the rebellion . Perhaps though NATO is waiting for Gaddafi to put his tanks and artellery on exposed terrain during their long march to Bengazi . We can only hope .

A government spokesman said Libya was ready for a `` political solution '' with world powers . He said the country was ready to discuss political reform , but Gaddafi had to stay . Libyan TV showed Gaddafi saluting supporters outside his fortified compound in Tripoli late on Monday . But some residents of the capital , angered by fuel shortages and long queues for basic goods , began openly predicting his imminent downfall . With Libya in chaos , an official in neighbouring Algeria told Reuters that al Qaeda was exploiting the conflict to acquire weapons , including surface-to-air missiles . The U.S. State Department said it had raised concerns with the Libyan rebels about the Islamist group obtaining arms in the east of the country , where they are battling Gaddafi 's forces . Evacuees from Misrata , the rebels ' last major stronghold in western Libya , described the city as `` hell . '' They said Gaddafi 's troops were using tanks and snipers against residents , littering the streets with corpses and filling hospitals with the wounded . `` You have to visit Misrata to see the massacre by Gaddafi , '' said Omar Boubaker , a 40-year-old engineer with a bullet wound to the leg , brought to the Tunisian port of Sfax by a French aid group . `` Corpses are in the street . Hospitals are overflowing . '' Misrata rose up with other towns against Gaddafi last month but is the only major one in western Libyan left in rebel hands . `` I could live or die , but I am thinking of my family and friends who are stranded in the hell of Misrata , '' said tearful evacuee Abdullah Lacheeb , who had serious injuries to his pelvis and stomach and a bullet wound in his leg . `` Imagine , they use tanks against civilians . He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is prepared to kill everyone there ... I am thinking of my family . '' State TV showed live footage of Gaddafi briefly waving to supporters through the roof of a Jeep outside his compound while bodyguards tried to prevent them from mobbing him . But in the maze-like lanes of Tripoli 's medieval market , some openly forecast his fall as rebels based in eastern Libya battle his forces . `` People from the east will come here . Maybe in two weeks , '' said one entrepreneur who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals . `` But now , people are afraid . '' Stalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting , or facing food and fuel shortages , have prompted a flurry of diplomacy to try to end the civil war . Turkey said it was seeking to broker a ceasefire as an envoy from Gaddafi 's government arrived in Ankara from Athens . `` Turkey will continue to do its best to end the sufferings and to contribute to the process of making a road map that includes the political demands of Libyan people , '' Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said after the arrival of Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi from earlier talks in Greece . Turkey also expected officials of the rebel National Council to visit Ankara soon , Davutoglu told a news conference . A Turkish Foreign Ministry official said both sides had `` conveyed that they have some opinions about a possible ceasefire . '' Obeidi later also held talks in Malta . ITALY SAYS GADDAFI MUST GOT Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , who had spoken to Greek officials after Obeidi 's talks in Athens , dismissed the Libyan message . `` A solution for the future of Libya has a pre-condition : that Gaddafi 's regime leaves and is out and that Gaddafi himself and his family leave the country , '' he said . In Washington , the U.S. Treasury said it had lifted sanctions against former Libyan foreign minister Moussa Koussa in the hopes that other senior officials would defect . -LRB- nWNA5394 -RRB- Koussa fled to Britain last week and Scottish police want to question him over the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing , for which Libya accepted responsibility and paid compensation to relatives of the 270 dead . U.N.-mandated air strikes to protect civilians have so far failed to halt attacks in Misrata by the Libyan army . At least five people died when Gaddafi forces shelled a residential area of Misrata late on Monday , a doctor said , warning the death toll was likely to keep rising . `` The reception in the hospital is full . Five people were confirmed killed in the last two hours and five more are in critical condition , '' the doctor , who gave his name as Ramadan , told Reuters by phone from the city . Libyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . Accounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . A Turkish ship that sailed into Misrata to rescue 250 wounded was protected by Turkish warplanes and warships and had to leave in a hurry after thousands pressed forward on the dock , pleading to be evacuated . Another ship operated by Medecins Sans Frontieres docked in Sfax with 71 wounded from Misrata . In Algiers , a senior security official said that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , the Islamist group 's regional wing , was getting hold of weapons in Libya . The Algerian official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said a convoy of eight Toyota pick-up trucks had left eastern Libya and headed via Chad and Niger to northern Mali , where in the past few days it had delivered a cargo of weapons . `` We know that this is not the first convoy and that it is still ongoing , '' the official said . `` Several military barracks have been pillaged in this region -LRB- eastern Libya -RRB- with their arsenals and weapons stores , and the elements of AQIM who were present could not have failed to profit from this opportunity . '' In Washington , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States had raised concerns with the Libyan rebels . `` We are aware of these reports too and it has been one of the topics of our conversation with ... the opposition forces , '' Toner told reporters . `` We have made very clear our concerns and they have ... pledged that they will look into it . '' Gaddafi says the uprising is fueled by Islamist radicals and Western nations who want to control Libya 's oil . The rebels , whose stronghold is in the eastern city of Benghazi , want nothing less than the removal of Gaddafi and his circle . The U.N.-mandated military intervention , in which warplanes have attacked Gaddafi 's armor , radar and air defences , began on March 19 and was intended to protect civilians caught up in fighting between pro-Gaddafi forces and the rebels . After chasing each other up and down the coast road linking the oil ports of eastern Libya with Gaddafi 's tribal heartland further west , the two sides are stuck around Brega , a sparsely populated settlement spread over more than 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It would have been over two weeks ago had the U.S. not intervened . Why will the West not even hear what the Libyan government has to say ? We refuse to even talk to him . That does n't make much sense to me . It 's the same as if I was in a fight with someone and I kept punching them and told them I wanted peace but they had to vanish -LRB- as I kept punching them -RRB- and then when they say , ` ok lets talk about this , we want to compromise . ' We follow them up with a big F U. High stand-off technology has limited effects on urban combat . The boots-on-the-ground military understand this . Misrata is clearly the line in the sand for Gaddhafi , since it only lies about 200 kilos east of Tripoli -- he has to throw everything at the rebels in this location or defeat will be imminent . We should finish off targeting the tanks and large artillery and then let the rebels complete their objective . Otherwise , we 'll be seen once again as an imperialistic , intervening force which wants oil and a market for western products -LRB- mostly weapons -RRB- . This discussion is now closed .

The Senate blocked a vote on a proposal by Rand Paul , a freshman senator and Tea Party Republican , aimed at reaffirming the constitutional authority of Congress to declare war . The problem with Paul 's amendment , as seen by many members of the Democratic majority , was that it quoted then-Senator Barack Obama 's words from 2007 in what appeared to be an attempt to embarrass the Democratic president . Back in 2007 , Senator Obama told the Boston Globe `` the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- nation . '' Paul said he wanted the Senate to endorse Obama 's past words and thus establish that the president had overreached in authorizing the U.S. action in Libya last month without first obtaining Congress ' approval . Paul 's proposal was `` too cute by half , '' declared Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday after she joined other senators in voting to table it , 90-10 . Paul had trouble getting even his fellow Republicans to support his idea . Some said they did n't approve of where he had chosen to offer his war powers amendment -- on legislation to do with small businesses . `` I think we need to address Libya , when -LRB- that 's -RRB- the focus , '' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Republican , after the vote . Obama briefed leading members of Congress the day before launching attacks on Libya last month , but did not seek debate or vote in Congress , as some lawmakers say he should have . Article I of the U.S. Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war . But Article 2 says the president is `` Commander in Chief '' of the armed forces . This has been a source of friction between the two branches for decades . `` I am amazed that this body does not take the time to debate whether we should be in Libya , '' Paul said on the Senate floor Tuesday . `` Some say we 'll debate it next week . ... The debate should occur before we go to war , '' Paul told senators . Indeed , leading senators have been discussing for days whether to retroactively authorize U.S. military intervention in Libya . But they have n't been able to agree on a draft text . `` We do n't know yet -LRB- whether there will be a resolution -RRB- . We 're just discussing it informally , '' said Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin , a Democrat who has been supportive of the Libyan intervention . `` I think there should be an expression from Congress '' about the war , the Senate 's number two Republican , Jon Kyl , told reporters . `` The problem has been getting a consensus on what that is . It has n't been easy . '' Kyl said Republican Senator John McCain , a supporter of the Libya war , was trying to get agreement with Democrats . The House has been waiting to see what the Senate would do , But some lawmakers , like House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard McKeon , a Republican , doubt the House could pass a resolution now that would approve the operation . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It is time to boot these incompetant elite from office with a new constitutional convention . The Congress is corrupt and can not be repaired . The cronies of the elected congress people are CBA -LRB- Crooked Bankers Association -RRB- that bailed out AIG crooks for $ 180 BILLION and then eliminated the transparency by hiding the $ 263 TRILLION derivative debt from the American taxpayers . Rand Paul is loved by the tea baggers so does the tea party care more about Libya then small businesses ? I think the senate should take care of more pressing issues then worrying about the past -- are we really at war if we do n't put troop on the ground and do n't try to take out the leader ? Also , this was an international effort put forth by the UN Once again all talk and no substance . Pand Paul did vote for the action in Libya on 3-1 , thats on record and he can not hide from that . Unanimous consent is still a vote in the senate . As a fact , most votes in the senate is by unanimous and only when a senator wants to debate or stall or object are there members on the floor to further discuss it . Sentor Rand Paul could of even put on hold on the resolution if he wanted to but he did n't . In other words , Rand Paul is no different than the rest but now the elections are near and the power grab is coming to head . This discussion is now closed .

The besieged city of Misrata , the only big population center in western Libya where a revolt against Gaddafi has not been crushed and which faces army tanks and snipers , is now the priority for NATO air strikes . But Libyan rebels on the battlefield complained about what they see as a dropping off in air support and a spokesman in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi said NATO `` disappointed us '' with its slow response that allowed Gaddafi forces to kill people . `` Either NATO does its work properly or we will ask the Security Council to suspend its work , '' said Abdel Fattah Younes , head of the rebel forces . `` NATO is moving very slowly , allowing Gaddafi forces to advance , '' he told reporters . `` NATO has become our problem , '' he said , adding that NATO inaction was allowing the army to advance and letting them kill the people of Misrata `` every day . '' As the row erupted over the military campaign , the International Criminal Court said on Tuesday it had evidence Gaddafi 's government had developed plans to crush protests by killing civilians even before the uprising in Libya broke out . `` We have evidence that after the Tunisia and Egypt conflicts in January , people in the regime were planning how to control demonstrations inside Libya , '' court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told Reuters in The Hague . `` The planning at the beginning was to use tear gas and -LRB- if that failed to work -RRB- ... , shooting , '' said Moreno-Ocampo who is investigating Gaddafi , his sons and close aides and who will be requesting arrest warrants in the coming weeks . Protests against the government that began on February 15 swiftly descended into civil war after Gaddafi forces opened fire on demonstrators . He then crushed uprisings in Libya 's west , leaving the east and Misrata in rebel hands . NATO-led air power is now holding the balance in Libya , preventing Gaddafi forces from overrunning the revolt in the North African desert state but unable for now to hand the rebels outright victory with a stalemate on the desert battlefield . NATO took command of operations in Libya from a coalition led by the United States , Britain and France on March 31 and is enforcing a no-fly zone ordered by the United Nations and launching air strikes on Gaddafi forces to protect civilians . `` The assessment is that we have taken out 30 percent of the military capacity of Gaddafi , '' Brigadier General Mark van Uhm , a senior NATO staff officer , said in Brussels . Over the last day , air strikes around Misrata hit Gaddafi 's tanks , air defense systems and other armored vehicles . Near Brega in the east , where intense fighting raged for a sixth day on Tuesday , NATO aircraft struck a rocket launcher . Answering earlier criticism by insurgents that air power became less effective with the alliance in control , NATO officials said the presence in Libyan skies was undiminished . But Van Uhm said Gaddafi was using civilians as human shields and hiding his armor in populated areas , curbing NATO 's ability to hit targets . `` The operational tempo remains , but we have seen a change of tactics -LRB- from Gaddafi -RRB- , '' he said . `` When human beings are used as shields we do n't engage . '' There were other tactical changes . `` They are using more and more trucks and light vehicles ... and they are keeping more heavy equipment like armored vehicles -LRB- hidden -RRB- , '' said Van Uhm , who added that the end result was that Gaddafi was prevented from using heavy armor . Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict in the oil producing nation have failed to make progress with the government side offering concessions , but insisting Gaddafi stay in power , and rebels adamant that Libya 's leader for the past 41 years leave . After a series of rapid rebel advances followed by headlong retreats , the insurgents held their ground for six days in Brega , putting their best trained forces in to battle for the oil town and keeping the disorganised volunteers away . A sustained government bombardment of rockets and mortar bombs , however , pushed the insurgent pick-up truck cavalcade back towards the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , their biggest retreat in several days of inconclusive battles . `` Since the day NATO took over the air strikes , we have been falling back , '' said Ziad el Khafiefy , 20 , a rebel fighter . `` Gaddafi 's troops are hitting us with Grad missiles , '' said Mabrouk el Majbary , 35 . `` Something is wrong ... When the U.S. gave leadership to NATO , the bombings stopped . '' The rebels had shown better organization than in past weeks , keeping territory for longer but government troops mounted a sustained assault on Tuesday . The rebels are set for a boost with the arrival of a tanker in one of their ports which can carry one million barrels of crude , worth more than $ 100 million , which would be their first shipment since the fighting broke out . A Turkish ship arrived at the port of Cesme in western Turkey on Tuesday afternoon carrying 321 injured Libyans after visiting Benghazi and Misrata . Sirens wailed as ambulances rushed the injured to nearby hospitals . In the capital Tripoli , angered by fuel shortages and long queues for basic goods caused by sanctions and air strikes , some residents began openly predicting Gaddafi 's imminent downfall . Stepping up efforts to eradicate symbols of resistance against Gaddafi in western Libya , the army razed a mosque once used by rebels as a command center in Zawiyah . The government took reporters to the city to show it was under control . `` People are upset , '' said Mohammad , a shopowner . `` How can you remove a mosque in a central square just like that ? It 's a Muslim country . '' `` Do n't you see how tightly controlled we are now . Government spies have us surrounded in this city and we are scared to talk , '' said another resident . `` Those were revolutionaries and civilians that they killed , they were not gangs or al Qaeda . '' Stalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting or facing food and fuel shortages prompted a flurry of diplomacy to find a solution to the civil war . The government has offered concessions . Spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said Libya was ready for a `` political solution '' with world powers and offered a `` constitution , election , anything . But the leader has to lead this forward . '' Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi ended a diplomatic shuttle to Greece , Turkey and Malta to set out the government position . Libya 's Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa , once a close ally of Gaddafi , has defected to Britain . Turkey is expecting an envoy to visit from the opposition in the coming days and is listening to both sides . `` Both sides have a rigid stance , '' a Turkish Foreign Ministry official said after Obeidi 's visit . `` One side , the opposition , is insisting that Gaddafi should go . The other side is saying Gaddafi should stay . So there is no breakthrough yet . '' There has been talk of Gaddafi staying on as an historic figurehead with one of his sons overseeing a change in Libya towards democracy . But many Western leaders see no role for Gaddafi in Libya 's future . `` But let 's be clear , when Gaddafi leaves , that is when the real difficulties start and we need to prepare for that , that is bringing the country together again , '' said Sweden 's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt , who was involved in the Balkans conflict .

'' The besieged city of Misrata , the only big population center in western Libya where a revolt against Gaddafi has not been crushed and which faces army tanks and snipers , is now the priority for NATO air strikes , alliance officials said earlier . `` NATO blesses us every now and then with a bombardment here and there , and is letting the people of Misrata die every day , '' Abdel Fattah Younes , head of the rebel forces said in the eastern stronghold city of Benghazi . `` NATO has disappointed us . '' In reaction , NATO said it was carrying out its mandate . NATO took over from a coalition led by the United States , Britain and France on March 31 , putting the alliance in charge of air strikes targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure as well as policing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo . NATO had been moving very slowly , allowing Gaddafi forces to advance , Younes said , adding rebels were considering referring the issues with NATO to the U.N. Security Council which authorised its mission . `` NATO has become our problem , '' he said . A rebel spokesman said Misrata was hit again on Tuesday . `` Misrata was shelled with tank fire , artillery and mortars , '' the rebel , called Abdelsalam , told Reuters , adding : `` Unfortunately NATO operations have not been effective in Misrata . Civilians are dying every day . '' Stalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting or facing food and fuel shortages has prompted a flurry of diplomacy to find a solution to the civil war in this oil-producing North African desert state . Protests against the government that began on February 15 swiftly descended into civil war after Gaddafi forces opened fire on demonstrators . He then crushed uprisings in Libya 's west , leaving the east and Misrata in rebel hands . NATO-led air power is holding the balance in Libya , preventing Gaddafi forces from overrunning the rebels but unable for now to hand them outright victory . `` Either NATO does its work properly or I will ask the -LRB- rebel -RRB- national council to raise the matter with the Security Council , '' Younes , a former interior minister in Gaddafi 's administration who defected , told reporters . `` The reaction of NATO is very slow . One official calls another and then from the official to the head of NATO and from the head of NATO to the field commander . This takes eight hours , '' Younes said , adding : `` Misrata is being subjected to a full extermination . '' Asked about Younes 's remarks , NATO spokesman Oana Lungescu said : `` The facts speak for themselves . The pace of operations since NATO took over has not abated . We have conducted 851 sorties in the past six days ... we are fulfilling our mandate . '' Another NATO official said : `` The rebels may not see us . We may be 100 or 150 km away . We are some distance from where the fighting is going on so the rebels are not aware . '' Earlier in the day , NATO had given details of the campaign . `` The assessment is that we have taken out 30 percent of the military capacity of Gaddafi , '' Brigadier General Mark van Uhm , a senior NATO staff officer , said in Brussels . Over the last day , air strikes around Misrata hit Gaddafi 's tanks , air defense systems and other armored vehicles . Near Brega in the east , where intense fighting raged for a sixth day on Tuesday , NATO aircraft struck a rocket launcher . Answering earlier criticism by insurgents that air power was less effective with the alliance in control , NATO officials said the presence in Libyan skies was undiminished . Van Uhm said Gaddafi was using civilians as human shields and hiding his armor in populated areas , curbing NATO 's ability to hit targets . `` The operational tempo remains , but we have seen a change of tactics -LRB- from Gaddafi -RRB- , '' he said . `` When human beings are used as shields we do n't engage . '' Addressing NATO , Younes said : `` They say they do n't want to bomb in order not to kill civilians . The area where Gaddafi troops are does not include civilians . '' Abdelsalam in Misrata agreed . `` NATO says Gaddafi 's forces are hiding among civilians . But we tell them that there are no civilians left in the areas where the Gaddafi forces are positioned . We urge them to destroy civilian property to take out the snipers and armed gangs . '' After a series of rapid rebel advances followed by headlong retreats , the insurgents held their ground for six days in Brega , putting their best trained forces in to battle for the oil town and keeping the disorganised volunteers away . A sustained government bombardment of rockets and mortar bombs , however , pushed the insurgent pick-up truck cavalcade back toward the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , their biggest retreat in several days of inconclusive battles . `` Since the day NATO took over the air strikes , we have been falling back , '' said Ziad el Khafiefy , 20 , a rebel fighter , echoing Younes 's comments . `` Gaddafi 's troops are hitting us with Grad missiles , '' said Mabrouk el Majbary , 35 . `` Something is wrong ... When the U.S. gave leadership to NATO , the bombings stopped . '' As the row erupted over the military campaign , the International Criminal Court said on Tuesday it had evidence Gaddafi 's government had developed plans to crush protests by killing civilians even before the uprising in Libya broke out . `` We have evidence that after the Tunisia and Egypt conflicts in January , people in the regime were planning how to control demonstrations inside Libya , '' court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told Reuters in The Hague . `` The planning at the beginning was to use tear gas and -LRB- if that failed to work -RRB- ... , shooting , '' said Moreno-Ocampo who is investigating Gaddafi , his sons and close aides and who will be requesting arrest warrants in the coming weeks . The rebels are set for a boost with the arrival of a tanker in one of their ports which can carry one million barrels of crude , worth more than $ 100 million , which would be their first shipment since the fighting broke out .

Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have failed to make progress with the government side offering concessions , but insisting Gaddafi stay in power , and rebels adamant that Libya 's leader for the past 41 years leave . Libya has changed tack in the past days , stressing readiness for political reform as well as peace talks with rebels . `` All armed militias , if they want a peaceful end to this crisis , they have to give up their arms , and then they are most welcome to take part in the political process , '' Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters in Tripoli .

When the folks there took up arms against a lunatic they must have known what would result . When our President declared that Muammar had to go he put the US into an issue that is not our problem . Certainly we all have opinions and deplore the treatment of Libyans , but it is not our fight . I agree with '' MACIRA '' the United States should no longer involve itself in these internal fights in the middle east or anywhere else . We are not the World Police Force , World Court of Justice or World Welfare Provider . This is blood oil , conflict oil no one should be buying any oil from both parties . The fact that the guns that are been used to kill the people of Libya have been purchased from oil sales to europe and now its the other way around its just crazy supplying guns to the rebels with blood oil its just crazy .

There was no immediate official comment from Britain 's Ministry of Defense on Kaim 's comments about the field . Earlier , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces unleashed mortar rounds , tank fire and artillery shells on the western city of Misrata on as a French minister said NATO air strikes in Libya risked getting `` bogged down . '' Misrata , Libya 's third city , rose up with other towns against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule in mid-February , and it is now under attack by government troops after a violent crackdown put an end to most protests elsewhere in the west of the country . Rebels are angry at what they perceive to be a scaling back of operations since NATO took over an air campaign , following an early onslaught led by the United States , France and Britain that at one stage tilted the war in the rebels ' favor . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Gaddafi forces were making it harder for alliance pilots to distinguish them from civilians by hunkering down in populated areas . `` The situation is unclear . There is a risk of getting bogged down , '' he said . Juppe told France Info radio he would address the issue of tactics shortly with the head of NATO , adding Misrata 's ordeal `` can not go on . '' NATO has accused Gaddafi of using human shields to make targeting harder for its warplanes . Civil war in the vast North African desert oil producer ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies against his 41-year rule inspired by uprisings that have toppled or endangered other autocrats across the Arab world . Stalemate on the battlefield in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's coterie and the plight of civilians ensnared in fighting or running out of food and fuel has spurred a flurry of diplomacy in pursuit of a peaceful solution . But such efforts have made little headway , with the rebels adamant that Gaddafi step down while the government , aware of the limitations of Western intervention , has offered concessions hinting at democratization but insists he stay in power . In a blow to rebel finances , Gaddafi forces halted production at rebel-held oilfields in eastern Libya , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . Rebels want to resume exports to raise revenue for their uprising . Oilfields in Misla and the Waha area were hit by Gaddafi 's artillery on Tuesday and Wednesday , spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . The Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from Marsa el Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since the uprising began in February , shipping sources said . U.N.-mandated air strikes have so far failed to halt attacks by the Libyan army in besieged Misrata , where residents said snipers on rooftops and tanks firing on populated areas of the city have had a devastating effect . `` Gaddafi forces have changed tactics and are using human shields in urban areas , including in Misrata , '' Britain 's Foreign Office said on Wednesday . The head of Libya 's rebel army has condemned NATO for its slowness in ordering air strikes to protect civilians , saying the alliance was `` letting the people of Misrata die every day . '' Juppe said : `` We 've formally requested that there be no collateral damage for the civilian population ... That obviously makes operations more difficult . '' But General Abdel Fattah Younes was adamant that Gaddafi was conducting massacres . `` Day by day people are dying . Hundreds of families are being wiped off the face of the earth . Patience has its limits , '' he said . Asked whether he found NATO 's argument that it is trying to prevent civilian casualties convincing he said : `` No , it 's not convincing at all . NATO has other means . I requested there be combat helicopters like Apaches and Tigers . These damage tanks and armored vehicles with exact precision without harming civilians . '' Libyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . Accounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . Rebel criticism has put the Western military alliance on the defensive , particularly over Misrata . Spokeswoman Carmen Romero said that `` the pace of our operations continues unabated . The ambition and the position of our strikes has not changed . '' NATO air strikes are targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure but only to protect civilians , not to provide close air support for rebels , much to their dismay , as part of a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council . Relieving the siege of Misrata was a NATO priority but alliance officials conceded that Gaddafi 's army was proving a resourceful and elusive target . `` The situation on the ground is constantly evolving . Gaddafi 's forces are changing tactics , using civilian vehicles , hiding tanks in cities such as Misrata and using human shields to hide behind , '' Romero told reporters in Brussels . Misrata on Wednesday faced another heavy bombardment . `` There was firing on three fronts today , the port in the east , the center around Tripoli street and the west of the city . Mortars , tank fire , and artillery were used to shell those areas , '' rebel Abdelsalam said by telephone . `` NATO needs to either launch a serious operation to take out all the heavy armored vehicles , including tanks ... If they do n't want to do this , they should provide us with weapons to do it ourselves . '' Meanwhile , living conditions in Misrata worsened . `` People are panicking , especially women , children and old people . Most people left their homes for safer areas and found refuge with other families , '' Abdelsalam said , adding : `` No fruit and vegetables have been available in Misrata for over 25 days , bread is also difficult to find . People are scared to go out because of the snipers and the indiscriminate shelling . The upper-hand is still with Gaddafi 's forces . '' On the eastern battlefield , Libyan rebels regained ground in a new advance on the oil port of Brega on Wednesday but also accused NATO of inaction hindering their quest to oust Gaddafi . Ill-trained insurgents thrust westwards to the contested port , recovering mostly desert terrain lost in a pell-mell retreat from Gaddafi 's superior firepower the day before . Rebels returning to the tiny outpost of al-Arbaeen , midway between Brega and their frontline town of Ajdabiyah , spoke of rocket duels close to Brega 's port as both sides strived to end a ragged stalemate in the civil war . Rebel Idriss Abdel Karim complained of a lack of NATO support . '' -LRB- Government forces -RRB- are scared of NATO air strikes but NATO does n't bomb anything in the first place , '' he said . `` There have been no air strikes . We hear the sound , but they do n't bomb anything , '' said Hossam Ahmed , another rebel . `` What is NATO waiting for ? We have cities being destroyed . Ras Lanuf , Bin Jawad , Brega , and Gaddafi is destroying Misrata completely , '' said Ajdabiyah resident Said Emburak . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Younes needs to stop the politics game playing with NATO . Let s look at the facts . NATO , as requested , has taken command for operations in the Libyan theater . Having assumed control it is apparent NATO is interpreting the requirement to protect civilians in a narrower vein to of the coalition ; that is NATO acts where there is an imminent danger to the unarmed civilian population , as opposed to initiating pre-emptive strikes against Qaddafi forces . Regrettably much as the West fears and seeks to avoid civilian deaths it is unavoidable . The truth is that as a rule , in any conflict civilians will die . We continue to lie to ourselves and the public by perpetuating the lie . The best that any force can hope to achieve is to limit as far as possible the loss of innocent life . Instead of blaming NATO for civilian deaths , Younes needs to question the position of the opposition for the safety of innocent civilians . If he truly believes what he professes , that is , that his first priority is the unarmed civilian population , then he as leader of the opposition should call a halt to operations . If on the other hand , his aim is free and open representative government for the people , then his needs to recognize the reality of the situation on the ground , and work with NATO to minimize casualties , as opposed to undermining the NATO effort . Where is the United States , The Airforce pilots are better trained then other pilots around the world . A lot of Pilots around the world apply for trainning in the United States . As for the disaster that is going on in Misrata , `` DAFFY '' should n't be allowed to go off into exile . That Sick Person -LRB- DAFFY -RRB- should be bought before the World Courts and found guilty , Then Hung by the neck until very dead , the only problem is this faith is an easy way for all the killings over 42 year that him and his sons commited for there amussment . Also , Hang his Sons . Back to Misrata , United States how long are you going to sit on the side lines while the Blood of Misrata is stainning our Flag . Get back into the fight , you know that we can make a differents . The USA just ca n't win . If we bomb Gaddafi 's military and accidentally hit civilians -LRB- who were allegedly placed near military targets by the enemy -RRB- we are evil and careless ; if we do n't bomb them we are n't helping out even though we `` should '' . When we hand over operations to NATO , people complain that they do n't blow stuff up as efficiently as we had been doing . Meanwhile , it 's our taxes paying for most of this , during a time when the Federal government is close to shutting down for lack of funds due to them being wasteful and inefficient . I am glad that we threw our UN vote towards helping the rebels , but I wish we were less gung-ho about sending our military around the world . I have a bad feeling that my taxes are going to pay for rebuilding yet another foreign country instead of paying off our national debt or -LRB- gasp -RRB- improving our own situation .

The visit by Chris Stevens , former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Tripoli , reflects a U.S. effort effort to deepen its contacts with the rebels , who are fighting a civil war against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . NATO-led air power is now maintaining the balance in Libya , preventing Gaddafi 's forces from overrunning the seven-week old revolt but unable for now to hand the rebels outright victory . While U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has twice met a top representative of the opposition Transitional National Council , the United States has not followed its allies France and Italy in formally recognizing it . U.S. officials say they are still gathering information about the opposition and its objectives , though they have praised its stated commitments to democracy and human rights . `` He 's there to get to know the members of the TNC , '' said the U.S. official . Stevens will explore what kind of political system the opposition plans to build and how to help it pay its bills given international sanctions on Libya , the official said . `` We recognize the TNC will need funds to keep it going and we are looking at ways in which we can assist , '' he said , saying the idea was to look at doing so `` through the international community given the challenges that sanctions pose . '' Stevens also plans to discuss humanitarian assistance for the opposition , he said . At the Pentagon , Press Secretary Geoff Morrell noted discussions within the U.S. government about the possibility of providing `` non-lethal '' support for the rebels , including medical supplies or personnel protection vehicles . Libya is the latest Arab nation this year to witness a popular uprising against an authoritarian leader , following demonstrations that toppled Tunisia 's Zine al-Abedine Ben Ali in January and Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak in February .

The comments at a Senate hearing by General Carter Ham , who led the coalition air campaign before Washington handed over command to NATO , is likely to stoke debate in the United States about the next steps in Libya . President Barack Obama has ruled out sending ground forces to the North African oil-exporting nation and top administration officials have stressed the limits of American involvement in what could become a protracted civil war . Obama has called for Gaddafi to leave but has insisted the United States will not use military force to oust him . Senator John McCain , a Republican who is pushing for greater U.S. involvement , grilled Ham about the risks of Gaddafi staying in power . Asked by McCain whether he believed the situation could be described as a stalemate or an emerging stalemate , Ham said : `` I would agree with that at present on the ground . '' Ham , head of the U.S. military 's Africa Command , later acknowledged that the likelihood of a stalemate was higher now than before the United States passed control of the air campaign to NATO on March 31 . `` So right now we are facing the prospect of a stalemate , which then means Gaddafi remains in power , '' McCain said . `` Which then means that we will then have a very , very serious situation with Mr. Gaddafi in the future if he remains in power , particularly given his past record . '' The debate underscored tensions within Washington about how to best influence events in Libya , where poorly trained rebels are outgunned by Gaddafi 's loyalist forces despite a coalition air campaign . Asked by Senator Lindsey Graham how the war would end , Ham said : `` I think it does not end militarily . '' He said there was a low likelihood that rebels would be able to fight their way to Tripoli and oust Gaddafi by force . `` That 's a very honest answer . I would assess -LRB- the chance -RRB- as almost impossible , '' replied Graham , a Republican . But Washington has also been reluctant to firmly side with the rebels , citing concerns that extremists might be among their ranks . A U.S. commander recently said that intelligence detected `` flickers '' of a possible al Qaeda presence among the rebels , and an Algerian official said al Qaeda had acquired some arms in Libya . Ham renewed that cautious line on Thursday . `` We would need , I think , necessarily to be careful about providing lethal means to a group unless we are assured that those U.S.-provided weapons would not fall into the hands of extremist organizations , '' Ham said . He cited the stated intent of al Qaeda 's North Africa arm , al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , to aid the opposition . `` It has been very difficult to ascertain whether that intent to support the opposition with AQIM personnel has actually materialized in anything on the ground , '' Ham said . `` We 're watching that for indications of that very clearly . '' Ham defended the work of NATO in the face of criticism by the head of Libya 's rebels , who condemned the alliance this week for its slow chain of command in ordering air strikes to protect civilians . A NATO air strike on Thursday killed at least five rebels near the Libyan port of Brega . It was the second time in less than a week that rebels had blamed NATO for bombing their comrades by mistake . -LRB- Editing by Vicki Allen and Laura MacInnis -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Full Article Libya says NATO air strike hits major oil field TRIPOLI | Thu Apr 7 , 2011 4:03 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya said a U.N.-mandated British air strike had hit its major Sarir oilfield killing three guards and damaging a pipeline connecting the field to a Mediterranean port . `` British warplanes have attacked , have carried out an air strike against the Sarir oilfield which killed three oilfield guards and other employees at the field were also injured , '' Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . There was no immediate official comment from Britain 's Ministry of Defense on Kaim 's comments about the field . Earlier , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces unleashed mortar rounds , tank fire and artillery shells on the western city of Misrata on as a French minister said NATO air strikes in Libya risked getting `` bogged down '' . Misrata , Libya 's third city , rose up with other towns against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule in mid-February , and it is now under attack by government troops after a violent crackdown put an end to most protests elsewhere in the west of the country . Rebels are angry at what they perceive to be a scaling back of operations since NATO took over an air campaign , following an early onslaught led by the United States , France and Britain that at one stage tilted the war in the rebels ' favor . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Gaddafi forces were making it harder for alliance pilots to distinguish them from civilians by hunkering down in populated areas . `` The situation is unclear . There is a risk of getting bogged down , '' he said . Juppe told France Info radio he would address the issue of tactics shortly with the head of NATO , adding Misrata 's ordeal `` can not go on '' . NATO has accused Gaddafi of using human shields to make targeting harder for its warplanes . Civil war in the vast North African desert oil producer ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies against his 41-year rule inspired by uprisings that have toppled or endangered other autocrats across the Arab world . Stalemate on the battlefield in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's coterie and the plight of civilians ensnared in fighting or running out of food and fuel has spurred a flurry of diplomacy in pursuit of a peaceful solution . But such efforts have made little headway , with the rebels adamant that Gaddafi step down while the government , aware of the limitations of Western intervention , has offered concessions hinting at democratisation but insists he stay in power . In a blow to rebel finances , Gaddafi forces halted production at rebel-held oilfields in eastern Libya , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . Rebels want to resume exports to raise revenue for their uprising . Oilfields in Misla and the Waha area were hit by Gaddafi 's artillery on Tuesday and Wednesday , spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . The Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from Marsa el Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since the uprising began in February , shipping sources said . U.N.-mandated air strikes have so far failed to halt attacks by the Libyan army in besieged Misrata , where residents said snipers on rooftops and tanks firing on populated areas of the city have had a devastating effect . `` Gaddafi forces have changed tactics and are using human shields in urban areas , including in Misrata , '' Britain 's Foreign Office said on Wednesday . The head of Libya 's rebel army has condemned NATO for its slowness in ordering air strikes to protect civilians , saying the alliance was `` letting the people of Misrata die every day '' . Juppe said : `` We 've formally requested that there be no collateral damage for the civilian population ... That obviously makes operations more difficult . '' But General Abdel Fattah Younes was adamant that Gaddafi was conducting massacres . `` Day by day people are dying . Hundreds of families are being wiped off the face of the earth . Patience has its limits , '' he said . Asked whether he found NATO 's argument that it is trying to prevent civilian casualties convincing he said : `` No , it 's not convincing at all . NATO has other means . I requested there be combat helicopters like Apaches and Tigers . These damage tanks and armored vehicles with exact precision without harming civilians . '' Libyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . Accounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . Rebel criticism has put the Western military alliance on the defensive , particularly over Misrata . Spokeswoman Carmen Romero said that `` the pace of our operations continues unabated . The ambition and the position of our strikes has not changed '' . NATO air strikes are targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure but only to protect civilians , not to provide close air support for rebels , much to their dismay , as part of a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council . Relieving the siege of Misrata was a NATO priority but alliance officials conceded that Gaddafi 's army was proving a resourceful and elusive target . `` The situation on the ground is constantly evolving . Gaddafi 's forces are changing tactics , using civilian vehicles , hiding tanks in cities such as Misrata and using human shields to hide behind , '' Romero told reporters in Brussels . Misrata on Wednesday faced another heavy bombardment . `` There was firing on three fronts today , the port in the east , the center around Tripoli street and the west of the city . Mortars , tank fire , and artillery were used to shell those areas , '' rebel Abdelsalam said by telephone . `` NATO needs to either launch a serious operation to take out all the heavy armored vehicles , including tanks ... If they do n't want to do this , they should provide us with weapons to do it ourselves . '' Meanwhile , living conditions in Misrata worsened . `` People are panicking , especially women , children and old people . Most people left their homes for safer areas and found refuge with other families , '' Abdelsalam said , adding : `` No fruit and vegetables have been available in Misrata for over 25 days , bread is also difficult to find . People are scared to go out because of the snipers and the indiscriminate shelling . The upper-hand is still with Gaddafi 's forces . '' On the eastern battlefield , Libyan rebels regained ground in a new advance on the oil port of Brega on Wednesday but also accused NATO of inaction hindering their quest to oust Gaddafi . Ill-trained insurgents thrust westwards to the contested port , recovering mostly desert terrain lost in a pell-mell retreat from Gaddafi 's superior firepower the day before . Rebels returning to the tiny outpost of al-Arbaeen , midway between Brega and their frontline town of Ajdabiyah , spoke of rocket duels close to Brega 's port as both sides strived to end a ragged stalemate in the civil war . Rebel Idriss Abdel Karim complained of a lack of NATO support . '' -LRB- Government forces -RRB- are scared of NATO air strikes but NATO does n't bomb anything in the first place , '' he said . `` There have been no air strikes . We hear the sound , but they do n't bomb anything , '' said Hossam Ahmed , another rebel . `` What is NATO waiting for ? We have cities being destroyed . Ras Lanuf , Bin Jawad , Brega , and Gaddafi is destroying Misrata completely , '' said Ajdabiyah resident Said Emburak .

In Washington , the head of U.S. Africa command told a Senate hearing the United States should not provide arms to the rebels without a better idea of who they were . Asked if there was an emerging stalemate in the seven-week-old conflict , General Carter Ham replied : `` I would agree with that at present , on the ground . '' In rebel-held eastern Libya , wounded rebels being brought to a hospital Ajdabiyah said their trucks and tanks were hit on Thursday by a NATO air strike outside Brega . NATO said it was investigating an attack by its aircraft on a tank column in the area along the Mediterranean coast on Thursday , saying the situation was `` unclear and fluid . '' The fighting for Brega , the only active front , has dragged on for a week and has entered a daily pattern of advances back and forth with neither side making major gains .

They are siding with Gaddafi , '' Salem Mislat , one of the rebels , said . A rebel commander said it appeared to be a case of `` friendly fire '' and said it did not cause tension with NATO although the rebels wanted an explanation . Rebels had brought about 20 tanks out of storage and were advancing with them along the coastal desert strip that divides Ajdabiyah and Brega when they were hit , he said . `` We would assume it was NATO by mistake , friendly fire , '' Abdel Fattah Younes told a news conference in Benghazi , speaking through an English translator . It was the second time in less than a week that rebels had blamed NATO for bombing their comrades by mistake . Thirteen were killed in an air strike not far from the same spot on Saturday . Rebel spokesmen told Reuters Gaddafi forces killed five people and wounded 25 in an artillery bombardment of the isolated and besieged western city of Misrata on Wednesday . The barrage forced the temporary closure of Misrata 's port , a vital lifeline for supplies to besieged civilians , the spokesmen said . Misrata , Libya 's third city , rose up with other towns against Gaddafi in mid-February and has been under siege for weeks , after a violent crackdown put an end to most protests elsewhere in the west of the country . A rebel spokesman told Reuters that people in Misrata were crammed five families to a house in the few safe districts , to escape a rain of mortar shells from Gaddafi forces which have subjected them to weeks of sniper and artillery fire . Two rebel spokesmen reported fighting on a key road to the city 's port as government forces tried to advance . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about deteriorating conditions for civilians in Misrata and Zintan in the west , and Brega in the east . He said the situation in Misrata was particularly grave with the city under heavy bombardment and shortages of food , water and medical supplies . Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was working on a `` road map '' to end the war in Libya which would include a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Gaddafi 's forces from some cities . Turkey has held talks with envoys from Gaddafi 's government and representatives of the opposition . A rebel spokesman said later the rebels rejected talks with Gaddafi and demanded he leave power . Sweden said its warplanes operating from Sicily took part in NATO operations against Gaddafi on Thursday , the first combat sortie by the Nordic country 's air force since the early 1960s . The civil war has cut Libyan oil output by 80 percent , a senior government official said on Thursday , as rebels and Gaddafi 's forces traded exchanged accusations over who had attacked oil fields vital to both sides . Rebels say government attacks on three different installations in the east have halted production of the oil they desperately need to finance the uprising against Gaddafi . The government 's Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters the British air force had damaged an oil pipeline in a strike against the Sarir oilfield which killed three guards . NATO denied the alliance carried out any air strikes in the Sarir area and said forces loyal to Gaddafi were responsible for an attack which started a fire in the oilfield . Shokri Ghanem , chairman of the government National Oil Corporation , told Reuters on Thursday the country 's production had fallen to 250,000 to 300,000 barrels per day compared with 1.6 million before the uprising . The Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from the port of Marsa el-Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday , apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since their uprising began in February . Oil traders said the cargo , vital to fund the uprising , was headed for China . After reported advances by Gaddafi forces from Brega toward Ajdabiyah during the day , both sides appeared to have withdrawn within their secure lines by nightfall , following a familiar pattern . A senior Treasury official said Washington had frozen more than $ 34 billion of Libyan assets as part of sanctions against Gaddafi and his top officials . European governments had also frozen a substantial amount he said . `` Mr. Gaddafi knows what he must do , '' Clinton told a news conference with Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , reiterating calls for a ceasefire , the withdrawal of his forces from cities they have stormed and his departure from Libya . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It is morally incorrect to support a rebellion , whose leaders one does not know , whose aims one is not sure of , I mean how would it turn out if say the rebels turned out to be Al Qaeda ? I dont know if they are , maybe they are all very nice people , but so was Qaddafi when he first took power . This is an ill conceived mission that makes no sense at all . Gaddafi and some people say that NATO is killing innocent civilians and it has to stop because it is unacceptable . For some reason I do n't hear anyone saying that someone has to stop Gaddafi because he is using Human Shields and killing innocent civilians now and for 41 years for his and his sons amussment . What has to happen is that NATO needs to find a way aroung Gaddafi 's tactics and save the rebels that are being killed in Misrata and around Libya before it 's too late . All the rebels want is to be free of a tyrant and to live in a Democratic country . The other day I saw a picture of a little girl in Misrata with a severe wound caused by Gaddafi 's fighters firing wildly into Misrata . Tell me is a little girl no more then ten years old a rebel fighter or an innocent civilian , now who is killing innocent civilians , I believe Gaddafi 's govenment fighters are killing more innocent civilians then NATO by a far amount .

As explosions from what appeared to be NATO air strikes echoed in Tripoli , hundreds of children were taken by bus to a square outside a United Nations office , given green flags of Gaddafi 's revolution and told to shout anti-Western slogans . `` The children were brought here . This is their education . They shout all day instead of studying , '' said the man , shaking his head . He said he always supported Gaddafi but was upset with the authorities allowing Libya to descend into civil war . `` Cameron is a problem , he is bombing Libya , '' he said , in a reference to Britain 's part in the NATO campaign against Libya . `` But this is a problem too , '' he added , pointing at the children . Gaddafi has been in power for more than four decades and two generations have grown up under his iron rule . In a country with a median age of about 24 , most Libyans have known no other leader . A rebellion in the east may have emboldened Libyans there to speak about democratic change , but here in Gaddafi 's stronghold his personality cult still weighs heavily on people 's minds . His portraits , usually showing Gaddafi in military uniform with rays of light shining behind him , adorn many houses . Soldiers , their heads wrapped in green turbans , patrol the city . State television plays patriotic songs and broadcasts images of Libyan tanks rolling through the desert . Dancing under the watchful eye of teachers and government minders , hundreds of children chanted `` Down , down USA '' and set off firecrackers outside the gates of the U.N. office . Some held gold-framed portraits of Gaddafi . Adults encouraged children to kiss the leader 's image in front of television cameras . Outside coffee shops , passersby clutching steaming cups stopped to watch the procession with bewilderment . Most children seemed indifferent to their task . For them , Gaddafi 's dominance is no novelty in a country where they have to study his Green Book of aphorisms as part of their curriculum . While the propaganda machine works overtime to prop up the image of a strong state , weeks of conflict and Western air strikes seemed to have loosened Gaddafi 's hold on people 's minds . Even during the most tightly controlled events , dissent is always evident . People are talking about change with varying degrees of openness , saying it is time for Gaddafi to go . `` People need to hope for change , '' a bookshop owner said quietly on a recent visit . `` Nothing more needs to be said . '' Ali , owner of a clothing shop , said he could not forgive a government that had given orders to shoot its own people during peaceful anti-government protests in February , a chain of events at the start of the uprising that led to the war . `` I used to love Gaddafi but many people have died , '' he said . `` It changed everything . Business was good before February . We can not live like this . Things have to change . '' On the surface , Gaddafi 's influence is still strong in Tripoli . People avoid eye contact with foreign journalists . `` Sarkozy , Cameron , Obama killer for petroleum , '' says an English-language banner in central Green Square . At al Fatah university , the picture was much the same . Hundreds of students , some draped in green flags head to toe , were taken by bus into the campus from all around Tripoli to celebrate Gaddafi 's rule on Thursday . `` We love Gaddafi . We hate the world , '' shouted one high school student . `` We want to kill our enemies .

Brent was poised for a fourth consecutive weekly gain , and its 5 percent rise would be the largest percentage rise since the week to February 25 . In addition to the Libyan conflict , ongoing unrest in the Middle East and bomb attacks intended to postpone Nigerian elections added to oil supply concerns . Brent crude for May rose $ 2.71 to $ 125.38 a barrel by 11:50 a.m. -LRB- 4:50 p.m. British time -RRB- , having hit $ 125.79 , the highest front-month price since August 2008 .

NATO leaders have acknowledged the limits of their air power , with analysts predicting a drawn-out conflict . Libya 's fellow OPEC member Nigeria , which produces 1.9 million bpd , postponed parliamentary elections again in some areas , although polls will go ahead in most of the country on Saturday as planned . `` Upcoming elections in Nigeria have already seen an uptick in violence in the oil rich states of Akwa Ibom and Balyesa , with any loss in Nigerian crude -LRB- similar in quality to Libya -RRB- likely to put further pressure on light-heavy differentials , '' said Barclays Capital analyst Amrita Sen.

Zuma , who with four other African heads of state met Gaddafi for several hours at the Libyan leader 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound , also called on NATO to stop air strikes on Libyan government targets to `` give ceasefire a chance . '' No one at the talks gave details of the roadmap for peace in this oil-producing nation . Rebels have said they will accept nothing less than an end to Gaddafi 's four decades in power , but Libyan officials say he will not quit . `` The brother leader delegation has accepted the roadmap as presented by us . We have to give ceasefire a chance , '' Zuma said , adding that the African delegation would now travel to the eastern city of Benghazi for talks with anti-Gaddafi rebels . NATO stepped up attacks on Gaddafi 's armor on Sunday to weaken the bitter siege of Misrata in the west and disrupt a dangerous advance by Gaddafi 's troops in the east . The alliance said it destroyed 11 tanks on the outskirts of the eastern rebel town of Ajdabiyah , which looked in danger of being overrun on Sunday , and 14 near Misrata , a lone insurgent bastion in the west that has been under siege for six weeks . There was no sign of any let-up in the fighting and despite the African leaders ' peace roadmap hopes of a negotiated settlement looked slim . A rebel spokesman rejected a deal with Gaddafi to end the conflict , bloodiest in a series of pro-democracy revolts across the Arab world that have ousted the autocratic leaders of Tunisia and Egypt . `` There is no other solution than the military solution , because this dictator 's language is annihilation , and people who speak this language only understand this language , '' spokesman Ahmad Bani told al Jazeera television . NATO said it had increased the tempo of its air operations over the weekend , after rebels accused it of responding too slowly to government attacks . The insurgents hailed the more muscular approach . The NATO strikes outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . The town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . A Reuters reporter saw six burning hulks surrounded by 15 charred and dismembered bodies in two sites 300 metres -LRB- 1,000 feet -RRB- apart on Ajdabiyah 's western approaches which rebels said were hit by air strikes . `` NATO has to do this to help us every single day . That is the only way we are going to win this war , '' said 25-year-old rebel Tarek Obeidy , standing over the bodies . The government attack , which began on Saturday , included a fierce artillery and rocket bombardment , while some of Gaddafi 's forces , including snipers , penetrated Ajdabiyah . Rebels cowered in alleys for several hours under the bombardment . The corpses of four rebels were found dumped on a roadside . `` Their throats were slit . They were all shot a few times in the chest as well . I just could not stop crying when I saw them , '' said rebel Muhammad Saad . `` This is becoming tougher and tougher . '' But by afternoon rebels looked back in control of Ajdabiyah , commanding key intersections , and the artillery and small arms fire had died down . Ajdabiyah had been the launch point for insurgents during a week-long fight for the oil port of Brega 70 km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- further west , and its fall would be a serious loss . Gaddafi , making his first appearance in front of the foreign media in weeks , joined the visiting African leaders at his Bab al-Aziziyah compound . He then climbed into a sports utility vehicle and was driven about 50 metres -LRB- yards -RRB- where he waved through the sunroof and made the `` V '' for victory sign to a crowd of cheering supporters . It was Gaddafi 's second appearance in two days after he received an ecstatic welcome at a Tripoli school on Saturday . The appearances , and Gaddafi 's upbeat demeanor , confirmed the impression among analysts that his circle has emerged from a period of paralysis and is hunkering down for a long campaign , another sign that mediation will be difficult . Analysts predict a drawn-out , low-level conflict possibly leading to partition between east and west in the sprawling North African Arab state , a major oil and natural gas producer . NATO 's commander of Libyan operations said the alliance , which took over air strikes against Gaddafi from three Western powers on March 31 , had destroyed `` a significant percentage '' of Gaddafi 's armor and ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli . Canadian Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard said after Sunday 's air attacks : `` The situation in Ajdabiyah , and Misrata in particular , is desperate for those Libyans who are being brutally shelled by the -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- regime . '' . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Killing people , whoever they are and for whatever reason , is a crime . If a tank or armored vehicle on the road is presumed to be attacking Libyan civilians , it 's absurd the pro-regime ones have to be decimated and pro-rebellion ones stay , contrary to NATO 's pledge of neutrality stance . It seems the West is impatient with an impasse that lasts so long and eager to jump in to achieve a mission at the touch of a button , or there will no more cheap oil to finance the economic recovery around the globe . Why is the West so desperate for the resources of Libya ? Is our economic situation that dire ? And yet , our dear leader and the Dems still insist on spending on `` academic fluff '' as usual . We need real financial planning for the US and the media , lest they go down with the people , needs to investigate the real economic situation , not the situation provided by the WH and the Fed , who are shaking in their boots hoping for a miracle to change the situation .

Full Article Libyan rebels reject African Union peace plan BENGHAZI , Libya | Mon Apr 11 , 2011 10:29 pm IST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels swiftly rejected an African Union peace initiative on Monday , saying there could be no deal to end a two-month-old civil war unless Muammar Gaddafi left power . The initiative collapsed hours after South African President Jacob Zuma , head of an African Union mission , said Gaddafi had accepted the plan , including a ceasefire proposal . As African presidents negotiated with the rebel leadership in their stronghold of Benghazi , residents said Gaddafi 's forces bombarded the besieged western city of Misrata where residents reported heavy fighting . Western leaders also rejected any deal that did not include Gaddafi 's removal and NATO refused to suspend its bombing of his forces unless there was a credible ceasefire . NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a Brussels news briefing that Gaddafi 's government had announced ceasefires in the past , but `` they did not keep their promises '' . Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told a news conference after the talks in Benghazi : `` The African Union initiative does not include the departure of Gaddafi and his sons from the Libyan political scene , therefore it is outdated . '' NATO said its air strikes against government armor , which have recently increased , would continue as long as Gaddafi targeted civilians . A resident of the coastal city of Misrata , which has been under siege for six weeks , told Reuters heavy fighting was under way on the eastern approaches and in the center . Rebels told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces fired Russian-made Grad rockets into the city , where conditions for civilians are said to be desperate . Earlier Al Jazeera television quoted a rebel spokesman as saying five people died and 20 were wounded in Misrata , a lone rebel bastion in western Libya . Zuma did not travel from Tripoli to Benghazi with other AU delegates , to the rebels ' surprise , but issued a statement when he got home saying the mission was `` a huge success '' . Libyan officials have repeatedly said that Gaddafi , who holds no official state position , will not quit . The AU delegation was met in Benghazi by up to 3,000 demonstrators holding banners reading : `` African Union take Gaddafi with you '' and `` Gaddafi has committed genocide '' . They pushed up to the doors of the hotel where the talks were held , yelling `` the people want the downfall of the regime '' . Officials from NATO , which is bombing Libyan government armor under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , said they took note of the African Union plan but the alliance would continue operations while civilians were at risk . Human Rights Watch accused Gaddafi 's forces of indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Misrata which violated international law . It said about 250 people had died . The African Union does not have a good track record in brokering peace deals , having failed recently to end conflicts or disputes in Somalia , Madagascar and Ivory Coast . At the front outside the eastern rebel-held town of Ajdabiyah , rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air strikes and said they were advancing westwards . But there were only light skirmishes on Monday on the contested road to the oil port of Brega , 70 kms -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- further west , in contrast to Sunday 's heavy fighting in Ajdabiyah when rebels repelled a government assault . NATO stepped up attacks on Gaddafi 's armor over the weekend , destroying 25 tanks around Misrata and Ajdabiyah after rebels accused them of acting too slowly . An AU statement after the Tripoli talks spoke of a transition but made no mention of Gaddafi 's future . Asked if the issue of him stepping aside was discussed , Ramtane Lamamra , AU Commissioner for Peace and Security , told reporters : `` There was some discussion . '' However he added : `` I can not report on confidential discussions because first of all I was not part of them . '' The AU proposal included an immediate cessation of hostilities , effective monitoring of the ceasefire , the delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of foreigners . In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States wanted to see `` the departure of Gaddafi from power and from Libya '' , but avoided comment on the AU plan . The rebels had previously rejected a negotiated outcome to what has become the bloodiest in a series of pro-democracy revolts across the Arab world that have ousted the autocratic leaders of Tunisia and Egypt . The NATO attacks outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . The town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . On Monday upbeat rebels were putting burned and mangled bodies into blankets by blackened government vehicles outside Ajdabiyah and dragging them into the desert for burial . `` We have been able to advance because of the air strikes , '' said rebel Belgassim El-Awami . It was not clear how far west the rebels had moved along a front which has swung back and forth for more than a week in a fight for the oil port of Brega . Opposition fighters have been overwhelmed by Gaddafi 's firepower in western Libya , close to his base of Tripoli , but are increasingly using guerrilla tactics to weaken his hold . Tripoli residents said there had been several attacks on army checkpoints and a police station in the last week and gunfire can be heard at night .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeated the U.S. view that the Libyan leader , embroiled in a civil war against rebels seeking to overthrow him , must leave power and the country but she did not include this on a list of `` non-negotiable '' demands . While a State Department official said the omission was not intentional , it suggested Clinton might be trying to leave some negotiating room to keep alive the African Union peace plan despite its rejection by the Benghazi-based opposition .

President Barack Obama , seeking to extricate U.S. troops from long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , has ruled out sending U.S. ground forces to Libya , a North African oil exporter which the United States long accused of sponsoring terrorism . The rebels said there could be no deal to end the two-month-old civil war unless Gaddafi , who has ruled the country for more than four decades , left power . Earlier , South African President Jacob Zuma , head of an AU delegation , said Gaddafi had accepted the plan , including a ceasefire proposal . Clinton largely sidestepped a question at a news conference about the U.S. view of the peace plan , saying she had received accounts of the proposal and how it was received by both sides but said she was waiting to get `` a full readout . '' She did not directly address a query on whether the proposal required that Gaddafi step down . `` We have made it very clear that we want to see a ceasefire . We want to see the Libyan regime forces pull back from the areas that they have forcibly entered . We want to see a resumption of water , electricity and other services to cities that have been brutalized by the Gaddafi forces . We want to see humanitarian assistance reach the people of Libya . These terms are non-negotiable , '' Clinton told reporters . `` We believe , too , that there needs to be a transition that reflects the will of the Libyan people and the departure of Gaddafi from power and from Libya , '' she added during a news conference with Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb .

'' `` Any future proposal that does not include this , we can not accept , '' he said , accusing Gaddafi of bombing , shelling and shooting civilians . A resident of Misrata told Reuters there was heavy fighting on the eastern approaches and in the center . Rebels told Reuters that Gaddafi 's forces had intensified the assault , for the first time firing truck-mounted , Russian-made Grad rockets into the city , where conditions for civilians are said to be desperate . Human Rights Watch accused Gaddafi 's forces of indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Misrata which violated international law . It said about 250 people had died . At the front outside the eastern rebel-held town of Ajdabiyah , rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air strikes and said they were advancing westwards . The International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- is already deployed in Libya 's rebel-held eastern territory , where it has supplied hospitals , distributed food and visited government soldiers captured during the conflict . Speaking in Tripoli alongside a government spokesman , its regional head Jean-Michel Monod said his team had been officially invited to the capital . `` Now we will officially be here open for business , '' he told reporters . `` Of course it was high time as a neutral , impartial and independent humanitarian organization that the ICRC would come here as well to conduct discussions with the authorities . '' Libyan Social Affairs Minister Ibrahim Zarouk al-Sharif said some aid operations had been used as a cover to supply rebels . `` If humanitarian aid is brought through humanitarian organizations who specialise in this kind of work then we would welcome it . But if it comes with a military face then we wo n't accept it , it 's basically a declaration of war and might lead to a much bigger conflict . '' At talks in Luxembourg , Italy quarrelled with other European Union governments on how to handle thousands of migrants fleeing the turmoil in Libya and elsewhere in north Africa , while the EU executive urged the bloc to do more for the refugees . NATO attacks outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . The town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . Opposition fighters have been overwhelmed by Gaddafi 's firepower in western Libya , close to his base of Tripoli , but are increasingly using guerrilla tactics to weaken his hold . Tripoli residents said there had been several attacks on army checkpoints and a police station in the last week and gunfire can be heard at night . Gaddafi 's former foreign minister Moussa Koussa , speaking in Britain where he fled last month , called on `` everybody , all the parties , to work to avoid taking Libya into a civil war . '' `` This will lead to bloodshed and make Libya a new Somalia , '' he told the BBC . `` More than that we refuse to divide Libya . The unity of Libya is essential to any solution and any settlement in Libya .

NEW YORK | Wed Apr 13 , 2011 3:46 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. crude oil prices rose on Wednesday , snapping two days of losses , getting a lift from data showing U.S. gasoline stockpiles plunged last week and from lingering worries about the Libyan conflict . U.S. crude for May delivery settled up 86 cents at $ 107.11 a barrel . In London , Brent May crude gained $ 1.96 to settle at $ 122.88 . U.S. gasoline inventories fell 7 million barrels last week , the biggest weekly drop since October 1998 , to 209.7 million barrels , their lowest level since October last year , data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed . `` The gasoline stocks data was really supportive today , '' said Andy Lebow , broker at MF Global in New York . The big drop in U.S. gasoline supplies came amid rising pump prices , with last week 's national average climbing to $ 3.79 a gallon after crude prices rallied to 2-1\\/2 - year highs . Rising U.S. gasoline prices have damaged confidence in the country 's future and forced Americans to adjust spending habits and lifestyles , a Reuters\\/Ipsos poll found . U.S. crude inventories rose 1.6 million barrels to 359.3 million barrels , their sixth straight week of gains , helping pull down crude futures briefly around midday . That dip came as the dollar strengthened ahead of a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama outlining his proposal to cut the ballooning U.S. budget deficit . `` The market seemed to take seriously this lurch toward fiscal austerity from Obama . The numbers on the initial release appeared compelling . Hence , dollar rallied a bit , pushing down energies and precious metals , '' said John Kilduff , partner at Again Capital LLC in New York . Oil prices rose early after a two-day sell-off that was driven by cautious comments from Goldman Sachs . The influential bank said a robust crude rally looked overdone . The International Energy Agency and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also raised a red flag on skyrocketing prices , saying they could hurt global demand . The civil war in OPEC member Libya has shut off most of its production , which was around 1.6 million bpd before unrest began . Rebel-controlled oil fields are pumping around 100,000 barrels per day , but only a `` minimal amount '' is being exported , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . He spoke in Qatar , where talks were ongoing on Libya 's future . International powers called for the first time for Muammar Gaddafi to step aside , but NATO members squabbled over launching more air strikes to help topple him . OPEC spare capacity should be enough to cope with such an outcome , provided the upheaval does not embroil other producer nations . Saudi Arabia alone has more than 3 million bpd to spare .

The source , who was present at talks between President Nicolas Sarkozy , Prime Minister David Cameron and their defense ministers , said France did not see the rebel force as sorely needing more arms . `` It does n't seem necessary today because the national transition council is not having problems finding the weapons they need and friends to show them how to use them , '' he said . `` We are not doing it . And nor are the British as far as I know , '' he added . `` It 's a decision that 's been taken -LRB- not to arm the rebels -RRB- but that does not mean we oppose those that do . '' He said the U.N. Security Council resolution authorising force to protect Libyan civilians also permitted arming the rebels `` because the best way to protect the population is to allow the Libyans who want to protect them to do so . '' Britain said on Wednesday it would supply 1,000 sets of body armor from surplus British defense supplies to Libyan rebels , on top of 100 satellite phones already sent . Wednesday 's talks in Paris cemented the Franco-British position in favor of ramping up air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi 's military , amid signs of cracks in the wider coalition . Sarkozy and Cameron met for dinner the same day coalition foreign ministers met in Qatar to discuss the stalemate in Libya 's civil war , calling for Gaddafi to go . Western Europe 's top two military powers are delivering most of the air strikes on Gaddafi 's armor and are frustrated at the smaller role played by allies , including the United States . Three weeks of air strikes have neither tipped the balance of the war in favor of rebels trying to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule nor ended his shelling of the besieged city of Misrata . `` This is about summing up the situation and making sure France and Britain are on the same page , '' another French source said of the Paris meeting , which lasted a couple of hours . `` Given the various proposals for a resolution , the idea is also to get them behind a single one to avoid Gaddafi taking advantage of nuances between the different ideas . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe this week criticised NATO for not doing enough to stop the bombing of Misrata and Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said he regretted the lack of military strikes by partners such as the United States . `` NATO is not able at this time to oblige partners to participate in this action . Like you , I deplore for example the fact that France and Britain are bearing the brunt of this effort , even if the United States is still providing essential aerial back-up , '' Longuet told parliament on Tuesday .

Obama and the leaders of France and Britain earlier on Friday published a joint newspaper article pledging to continue the military campaign until Gaddafi leaves power , effectively making regime change the officially-stated aim of their air war . More than a hundred government rockets crashed into Misrata on Friday , a second day of heavy bombardment of the city , the lone major bastion of the rebels in the western part of Libya . Rebels said government forces had reached the city 's center . `` I did n't expect that in three weeks , suddenly as a consequence of an air campaign , that Gaddafi would necessarily be gone , '' Obama said in an interview with the Associated Press . He said the mission had succeeded in stopping large-scale civilian casualties , especially in the rebel-held city of Benghazi , and would eventually succeed in ousting Gaddafi . `` You now have a stalemate on the ground militarily , but Gaddafi is still getting squeezed in all kinds of other ways . He is running out of money , he is running out of supplies . The noose is tightening and he is becoming more and more isolated . `` My expectation is that if we continue to apply that pressure and continue to protect civilians , which NATO is doing very capably , then I think over the long term Gaddafi will go and we will be successful . '' A rebel spokesman in Misrata said pro-Gaddafi forces had shelled both the center and the road leading to the port , a lifeline for trapped civilians and the main entry point for international aid agencies , killing eight people on Friday . `` Today was very tough ... Gaddafi 's forces entered Tripoli Street and Nakl al Theqeel road , '' he said by phone , referring to a main Misrata thoroughfare , scene of heavy clashes in recent weeks , and the road to the port . `` Witnesses said they saw pro-Gaddafi soldiers on foot in the city center today . Except for snipers , they usually stay in their tanks and armored vehicles , '' the spokesman added . A government reconnaissance helicopter had flown over the city , he said , despite a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council and enforced by NATO warplanes . Hundreds are believed to have died in Misrata , under what Obama , British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy described in their article as a `` medieval siege as Gaddafi tries to strangle its population into submission . '' `` It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government , '' they wrote in the article , published on both sides of the Atlantic . They acknowledged that their new goal of regime change went beyond the explicit terms of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force to protect civilians , but said Libyans would never be safe as long as Gaddafi remained in power . The United States led the bombing campaign in its first week , but has since then taken a back seat , putting NATO in command with the British and French responsible for most strikes on Gaddafi 's forces . Obama made clear Washington was not planning to resume to a more active military role . `` What we 're doing is still providing jamming capacity , intelligence , refueling , so we still have a lot of planes up there . We 're just not the ones who are providing strikes on the ground for the most part , '' he said . Britain and France have been trying to persuade other NATO allies to contribute more fire power . NATO ministers met for a second day on Friday in Berlin , where the divisions were clear . British Foreign Secretary William Hague and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen voiced optimism that allies would supply more combat planes , but Italy immediately ruled out ordering its aircraft to open fire . French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said London and Paris wanted to extend strikes to Gaddafi 's logistic installations to try to break a stalemate in the two-month civil war . Russia attended the NATO meeting and said the alliance was going beyond the terms of the U.N. Security Council resolution . Russia abstained but did not veto the resolution in March . On the fluid eastern Libyan front , rebels said Gaddafi forces advancing from the oil port of Brega had opened fire on the western outskirts of the insurgent-held town of Ajdabiyah on Friday , killing one of their fighters . In the capital Tripoli , Reuters reporters heard intermittent gunfire on Friday evening . There was no immediate explanation . Libyan state television said `` the bombardment of the crusader and colonial aggressors '' had struck the al-Assah area , about 170 km -LRB- 105 miles -RRB- west of the capital . The rebels have begged for more air strikes to avert what they say is a potential massacre in Misrata . A rescue ship carrying nearly 1,200 Asian and African migrants , many needing urgent medical attention after weeks with little food or water in Misrata , was expected in Benghazi . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO allies were searching for ways to provide funds to the rebels , including helping them to sell oil from areas they control . `` The opposition needs a lot of assistance , on the organizational side , on the humanitarian side , and on the military side , '' she said .

One witness said he saw around a dozen rockets land near the western entrance to town , which rebels wanted to use as a staging post to retake the oil port of Brega . Many fled as loud explosions boomed across the town . `` There are still some guys out there at the western gate but the situation is n't very good , '' said Wassim el-Agouri , a 25-year-old rebel volunteer waiting at Ajdabiyah 's eastern gate . `` We want weapons , modern weapons , '' said rebel Ayman Aswey , 21 . `` If we had those , we could advance against them . '' Ajdabiyah 's streets were almost deserted by mid-afternoon and rebels barricaded the roads with concrete blocks , tree branches and anything they could find for fear of an attack . Rebel pick-ups patrolled the streets and men took up positions across the town with machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers . Others returned to positions at the western gate with their weapons pointed west and south into the desert . `` We are ready for a street war . We have got dynamite and we 've got grenades , '' said rebel fighter Emtar el-Farjany , who was holding a stick of dynamite . Some rebels on Saturday made it into the outskirts of Brega , 50 miles to the west , but many others retreated to Ajdabiyah after six were killed by rockets fired by Gaddafi loyalists on the exposed coastal road joining the two towns . By Sunday , scores of volunteer fighters and civilian cars carrying men , women and children streamed east from Ajdabiyah up the coast road toward Benghazi , where the popular revolt against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule began on February 17 . Sunday marks a month since the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorising force to protect civilians in Libya , leading to an international air campaign . But despite NATO air strikes against Gaddafi 's armor , rebels have been unable to hold gains in weeks of back-and-forth fighting over the coastal towns in eastern Libya . `` From a military point of view , one can currently see there is a stalemate , '' the head of Germany 's intelligence service Ernst Uhrlau told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper . `` One can not predict at the moment how much longer Gaddafi can hold onto power . The area around Tripoli is much stronger in terms of the population and the tribes than the east , '' he said . In western Libya , the rebel-held city of Misrata has been under government siege for seven weeks , leading to a growing humanitarian crisis . Hundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed in the fighting and shelling of the city . A rebel spokesman said Gaddafi 's forces bombarded Misrata again on Sunday , killing at least six people . Abdel Basset Mezerik said at least 47 people were also wounded . The United States , France and Britain said last week they would not stop bombing Gaddafi 's forces until he left power . With NATO troops bogged down in Afghanistan , Western countries have however ruled out sending ground troops , a position reinforced by the British prime minister on Sunday . `` What we 've said is there is no question of invasion or an occupation -- this is not about Britain putting boots on the ground , '' David Cameron told Sky News in an interview . But he said outside powers would help in every other way to stop Gaddafi `` unleashing this hell on people in Misrata '' and other towns up and down the Libyan coast , including providing `` non-lethal equipment '' to the rebels . European Council President Herman van Rompuy said he viewed the Libyan rebel council as `` a valuable discussion partner ... that embodies the Libyan people 's aspirations , '' a political vote of confidence for a force which has struggled militarily . Earlier on Sunday a sandstorm obscured the flat expanse of desert stretching west from Ajdabiyah to Brega . Rebel Ahmed al-Zuwaihi blamed the weather for a lack of NATO air strikes . `` The weather is no good today . NATO has n't hit anything , '' he said . `` It 's a big opportunity for Gaddafi and he 's taking advantage of it . He might enter Ajdabiyah today . Today the planes are not going to hit anything . '' NATO warplanes instead bombed the area of Al-Hira , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- southwest of the capital Tripoli on Sunday and also hit the city of Sirte , Libyan state television said . Bursts of anti-aircraft fire were also heard in Tripoli on Sunday evening . Days of sporadic clashes on the road west to Brega have failed to break a deadlock in the fighting . Rebel officials said on Saturday their most experienced soldiers were clashing with Gaddafi 's forces on the edge of Brega . But the front line is hard to locate due to the hit-and-run style of fighting , long-distance shelling and the growing tendency of Gaddafi 's followers to launch flanking maneuvers and ambush less experienced rebel fighters on the coastal road . The rebels pushed hundreds of kilometers toward the capital Tripoli in late March after foreign warplanes began bombing Gaddafi 's positions to protect civilians , but proved unable to hold territory and were pushed back as far as Ajdabiyah . In Misrata , rebels say they have faced daily bombardment from Gaddafi 's forces . The U.S.-based rights group Human Rights Watch has also accused Gaddafi 's forces of using cluster bombs -- which scatter bomblets over a wide area , increasing civilian casualties . The Libyan government has rejected the allegations . A rebel spokesman , called Abdelsalam , said there was fighting around Misrata 's main thoroughfare Tripoli Street . `` Snipers are firing in all directions , '' he said . `` For three days , it was very tough . Gaddafi troops were launching powerful attacks . They have been firing artillery , mortars . '' Food was running short and long queues formed outside bakeries . Some streets were fast becoming unrecognizable . Hundreds of Libyans fled attacks by government forces in the mountains southwest of Tripoli and crossed into neighboring Tunisia . The region is populated by Berbers , an ethnic group traditionally viewed with suspicion by Gaddafi 's government . `` I 'm part of a convoy which included about 500 people fleeing death , '' said Aissa , from the town of Nalut . The Libyan government blames militants allied to al Qaeda for the fighting . Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi held talks with U.N. envoy Abdelilah Al-Khatib in Tripoli and condemned `` the unjustified crusader colonial aggression on Libya . '' He said Libya was ready to comply with U.N. resolutions to implement a ceasefire and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid , according to the Jana state news agency . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The Soviets equipped with modern tanks and apache choppers in 1988 were also not ambushed , defeated and driven out by Afghans holding small weapons . Tactics matters more than just hardware or sabotage . If the Western countries stop bombing Libya , the war will be over shortly ; on the other hand , if they continue to drop their bombs , this civil war will be prolonged and there will be a humanitarian catastrophe . There is no popular revolt against Khadafi , only a few thousand rebels armed and trained by the Western countries are fighting the Government forces . If Great Britain , France and US really love those Libyan civilian lives , they should send their carriers and all means of transportation to bring them to their country , away from the tyrant rule of Gaddafi .

PARIS | Mon Apr 18 , 2011 4:33 pm BST PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The photograph shows a French Rafale warplane at the Mitiga air base outside Tripoli . A small crowd of men , women and children mill around the fighter , its tail fin lit up by the North African sun . Taken at an air show in October 2009 , the picture is one of several grabbed by military aviation photographers from Dutch website scramble . nl that highlight one of the ironies in the West 's enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya . To take out Muammar Gaddafi 's air defenses , western powers such as France and Italy are using the very aircraft and weapons that only months ago they were showing off to the Libyan leader . French Rafales like those on show in 2009 flew the western alliance 's very first missions over Libya just over two weeks ago . One of the Rafale 's theoretical targets : Libya 's French-built Mirage jets which Paris had recently agreed to repair . The Libyan operation also marks the combat debut for the Eurofighter Typhoon , a competitor to the Dassault Rafale built by Britain , Germany , Italy and Spain . An Italian Air Force version of that plane was snapped at the 2009 show hosted by Libyan generals . Two weeks ago , that base - to which arms firms including Dassault returned last November - was attacked by western bombs . Times change , allegiances shift , but weapons companies will always find takers for their goods . Libya wo n't be buying new kit any time soon . But the no-fly zone has become a prime showcase for other potential weapons customers , underlining the power of western combat jets and smart bombs , or reminding potential buyers of the defensive systems needed to repel them . `` This is turning into the best shop window for competing aircraft for years . More even than in Iraq in 2003 , '' says Francis Tusa , editor of UK-based Defense Analysis . `` You are seeing for the first time on an operation the Typhoon and the Rafale up against each other , and both countries want to place an emphasis on exports . France is particularly desperate to sell the Rafale . '' Almost every modern conflict from the Spanish Civil War to Kosovo has served as a test of air power . But the Libyan operation to enforce UN resolution 1973 coincides with a new arms race -- a surge of demand in the $ 60 billion a year global fighter market and the arrival of a new generation of equipment in the air and at sea . For the countries and companies behind those planes and weapons , there 's no better sales tool than real combat . For air forces facing cuts , it is a strike for the value of air power itself . `` As soon as an aircraft or weapon is used on operational deployment , that instantly becomes a major marketing ploy ; it becomes ` proven in combat ' , '' says a former defense export official with a NATO country , speaking on condition of anonymity about the sensitive subject . A spokesman for the Eurofighter consortium said it had `` never been involved in talks to sell the aircraft to Libya '' and its presence at the Lavex air show outside Tripoli in 2009 was part of an Italian delegation organised at government level . Defense sources tell Reuters that Britain and Germany had vetoed any sale of Italian Typhoons to Libya , but the amount of other Italian military hardware on display demonstrated warm relations at the time between Tripoli and the government of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . France has been less timid about announcing arms talks with Libya which briefly held an exclusive option for Rafale jets .

Britain 's move is likely to anger Russia , which has already said that Western attempts to topple Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi violate a U.N. resolution which only authorised the use of force to protect civilians . `` The U.N. Security Council never aimed to topple the Libyan regime , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Belgrade on Tuesday . `` All those who are currently using the U.N. resolution for that aim are violating the U.N. mandate . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters on Tuesday he also opposed sending troops into Libya . But a French diplomatic source told Reuters Paris might send military liaison officers to Libya in the days ahead . Britain 's move also caused some dissent among supporters of British Prime Minister David Cameron 's coalition government . Several lawmakers from Cameron 's Conservative Party called for the recall of parliament , now in recess , to debate the move , saying that the ground had shifted since parliament approved British participation in the Libya no-fly zone last month . Conservative member of parliament John Baron said there was clear evidence of `` mission creep . '' `` What the no-fly zone has effectively become is the air force of the rebels , '' he told Sky News . Peter Bone , another Conservative lawmaker , voiced concern that Britain seemed to be `` taking sides in a civil war . '' Britain 's recent experiences in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , where hundreds of British soldiers were killed , have led to caution about new foreign military ventures . The leaders of the United States , Britain and France pledged last week to continue the military campaign until Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi leaves power . Britain 's Foreign Office said the team would advise the rebel interim national council on how to improve its organization , communications and logistics , but would not help plan rebel military operations . Britain says it has supplied rebels with telecommunications equipment and body armor but not arms .

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for a halt to the siege of Misrata and condemned the attacks , including a cluster bomb said to have exploded last week several hundred meters from the hospital in the west Libyan city . `` Under international law , the deliberate targeting of medical facilities is a war crime and the deliberate targeting or reckless endangerment of civilians may also amount to serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law , '' Pillay said in a statement . The rebels accuse forces supporting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi of using cluster bombs . The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said last week government forces had fired the weapons into residential areas of Misrata and it had found remnants . The Libyan government , which denies shelling civilians , has also denied this allegation . At least two medical clinics in Misrata are reported to have been hit by mortar rounds or sniper fire , according to Pillay . Libya 's third largest city and the insurgents ' last major stronghold in the west has been under siege for more than seven weeks . Rebels said they fought troops for control of a main thoroughfare there Wednesday and eight people had been killed the previous day , mostly civilians . Hundreds of people are believed to have been killed in Misrata where aid workers say the humanitarian situation is worsening due to a lack of food , water and medical supplies . `` Using imprecise weaponry such as cluster munitions , multiple rocket launchers and mortars , and other forms of heavy weaponry , in crowded urban areas will inevitably lead to civilian casualties , '' Pillay said , adding that women and children were among the dead . Pillay , a former U.N. war crimes judge , said pro-government forces besieging Misrata , including commanders , could be held criminally liable for their orders and acts . The International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- was already investigating possible crimes . ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo has said Libyan authorities decided they were ready to kill unarmed protesters opposed to Gaddafi 's 41-year rule even before unrest spread from Tunisia and Egypt . He has raised concern about abductions , torture and killings . Pillay voiced concern about mistreatment of journalists by the Libyan authorities and said at least two journalists had been killed and 16 were missing , including 10 foreigners . `` Dozens of others have been detained , assaulted , physically abused -- possibly to the point of torture -- or expelled .

Rebels said they fought Gaddafi 's forces for control of a main road in the besieged port city of 300,000 , the insurgents ' last bastion in the west of the country where civil war erupted in February over demands for an end to Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . Seven Libyan civilians , a Ukrainian doctor and a British photojournalist were killed in the course of heavy fighting between pro-government troops and insurgents in Misrata on Wednesday , medical workers said . Around 120 people were wounded , including the wife of the Ukrainian doctor who lost both of her legs , according to Khalid Abufalgha , a doctor on the Misrata medical committee that deals with civilian casualties . Photojournalist Tim Hetherington , co-director of Oscar-nominated war documentary `` Restrepo , '' died when a group including several photographers was caught in mortar fire . Another photographer was hospitalized in critical condition , doctors said . `` NATO warplanes are flying over Misrata but I do not know if there are strikes , '' a rebel spokesman calling himself Abdelsalam said by telephone . `` NATO has been inefficient in Misrata . NATO has completely failed to change things on the ground . '' Libyan state television said later that four people were killed in a NATO air strike on `` civilian and military targets '' in the Bir al-Ghanam area southwest of the capital Tripoli . There were `` losses in property and farmland , '' it said . Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Libya operations , advised Libyan civilians to keep away from Gaddafi 's forces to help NATO carry out effective air strikes . Hundreds of people are believed to have been killed in Misrata , where aid groups say the humanitarian situation is worsening due to a lack of food and medical supplies . Evidence surfaced on Wednesday that Gaddafi 's government is dodging U.N. sanctions to import gasoline to western Libya using intermediaries who transfer the fuel between ships in Tunisia , a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters . One intermediary company , Hong Kong-based Champlink , previously unknown to the oil trading community , has sought a transaction for fuel delivery into Libya , according to a fax obtained by Reuters , and European oil traders said they had been approached by other such firms . In Paris , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who has spearheaded U.N.-backed NATO intervention , pledged stronger military action at his first meeting with the leader of the opposition Libyan National Council , Mustafa Abdel Jalil . `` We are indeed going to intensify the attacks and respond to this request from the national transition council , '' an official in the president 's office said , quoting Sarkozy as telling Abdel Jalil : `` We will help you . '' He did not say how NATO-led forces planned to overcome the stalemate on the ground after the United States and several European allies declined last week to join ground strikes . A French military sources said Sarkozy had won approval from NATO to carry out more air strikes and France had moved six fighter jets from Corsica to the southern Greek island of Crete , closer to Libya , for that purpose . Italy , the former colonial power in Libya that has provided air bases for the NATO mission but says its own planes will not open fire , said it may send 10 military trainers as part of increased Western efforts to help the badly pressured rebels . President Barack Obama still opposes sending U.S. ground troops to Libya , the White House said on Wednesday , but he supports a French and British move to dispatch military advisors to help rebels fighting Gaddafi . Vice President Joe Biden insisted in an interview with the Financial Times that U.S. strike aircraft , requested by France , were not needed to achieve the alliance 's goal in Libya . `` If the Lord Almighty extricated the U.S. out of NATO and dropped it on the planet of Mars so we were no longer participating , it is bizarre to suggest that NATO and the rest of the world lacks the capacity to deal with Libya -- it does not , '' he was quoted as saying . `` Occasionally other countries lack the will , but this is not about capacity , '' Biden said . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has recommended $ 25 million in commodities and services for Libyan rebels that would not include weapons , the State Department said . Obama still must sign off on this provision of aid such as radios , body armor and halal ready-to-eat-meals , spokesman Mark Toner said . Western officials say NATO is attacking only military targets consistent with the alliance 's U.N. mandate to impose a no-fly zone and protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . Rebels want NATO to go much further and provide close air support so they can break a prolonged battlefield stalemate . Abdel Jalil told reporters he had invited Sarkozy to pay a visit to the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi to demonstrate France 's support for ending Gaddafi 's autocratic rule . `` I think that would be extremely important for the morale of the revolution , '' he said . French officials did not say if the president had accepted . Gaddafi 's son , Saif al-Islam , was quoted by Al Arabiya TV as saying the government would prevail over the rebels and a new constitution was ready for when the insurgency was vanquished . `` Libya will not go back to what it was , '' it quoted him as saying on Libyan state television . `` The era of the first Jamahiriya -LRB- people 's republic -RRB- is gone and a new draft constitution has been prepared . '' The rebels say forces loyal to Gaddafi have been bombarding Misrata heavily over the last week . In signs of hardship , there are long queues for petrol and electricity has been cut so residents depend on generators . Thousands of stranded foreign migrant workers are awaiting rescue in the port area . The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , said the Libyan government 's reported use of cluster munitions and heavy weapons in Misrata may amount to a war crime under international law . The government denies it is attacking civilians in Misrata . France 's decision to send up to 10 military advisers to work with the rebels came a day after Britain , the other main leader of the coalition , announced a similar move . Government spokesman Francois Baroin stressed France had no intention of sending troops into Libya , where Western powers are struggling to break a deadlock in a two-month-old conflict . The French officers are expected to advise rebel leaders on how to organize their ragtag forces , now struggling against Gaddafi 's better-armed and - trained army . They will also liaise with NATO on the location of rebels and Gaddafi 's troops . Asked whether the dispatch of liaison officers amounted to `` mission creep , '' military analyst Jean-Dominique Merchet said it was only a small team and they would not be training fighters but advising their senior officers . `` It 's about putting a bit of organization into the rebel forces . It 's the French and the British doing this , it 's clear that NATO is not very keen , nor the Americans , '' he said . Independent defense analyst Paul Beaver said the decision to send military advisers was stretching the U.N. resolution . `` But I think without it the rebels are going to be so disorganized that we will have a stalemate in what is almost a civil war now , '' Beaver said .

Two days earlier , he met an envoy of Gaddafi -- a rare diplomatic contact between Libya and one of the staunch allies of the Western coalition seeking to overthrow him . The source said Morocco favored a political agreement within the framework of the United Nations resolution which imposed a no-fly zone and called for a solution that would meet the demands of the Libyan people . `` Nobody has asked us to mediate , '' the source said . Morocco has been one of the small number of Arab countries and the only North African state openly involved in talks with Western powers over the Libyan crisis . Several Libyan tribes have their origins in Morocco so the historical link is strong .

The bombardment is still going on . '' Captured government troops said on Saturday they had been ordered to retreat from Misrata -- the only major rebel-held city in western Libya -- after a siege of nearly two months , and rebels fighting to overthrow Gaddafi had claimed victory . But the mood of victory was short-lived and the prospect of a turning point in the two-month conflict dimmed on Sunday . Government forces bombarded three residential areas and the city center , including Tripoli Street , the thoroughfare that has been the scene of intense fighting in recent weeks , Abdelsalam said . Rebel spokesman Safieddin said a large part of Tripoli Street was under the control of rebels , and that insurgents had launched an attack on the remaining Gaddafi forces after NATO air strikes on the city in the early hours . Rebels have so far been unable to advance from eastern Libya as they fight with Gaddafi 's troops on the coastal road between the towns of Ajdabiyah and Brega , outgunned and lacking cash for equipment and state-building . Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told a news conference in Kuwait on Sunday that the oil state would contribute 50 million Kuwaiti dinar -LRB- $ 177 million -RRB- to Libya 's rebel council . Fellow Gulf Arab state Qatar , which has joined the Western military operations in Libya , has been marketing Libyan oil on behalf of the rebels to help them generate income . An arms embargo on Libya is being enforced by NATO , but the rebels also need money to try to create the infrastructure of a state from scratch and care for victims of the conflict as they pursue their two-month-old battle to shake off Gaddafi 's rule . `` This amount will help us a lot in paying the salaries of employees who did not receive their little salaries for two months , '' Abdel Jalil said . `` We are capable of only covering 40 percent of this amount . We are in need of urgent aid . '' Hundreds have been killed in the fighting for Misrata , raising fears of a humanitarian crisis in the besieged city . Safieddin said at least 36 people had been killed there by Gaddafi 's forces since Saturday : eight during Sunday 's bombardment and 28 on Saturday , many killed by booby-traps left behind by retreating forces . More than 100 had been wounded . A Qatari ship docked at the Tunisian port of Sousse overnight carrying 127 Libyans and 11 Tunisians from Misrata , the Tunisian state news agency said . Rebels in their eastern stronghold Benghazi said they had no expectations of an early end to fighting in Misrata . `` I do n't think this is a real withdrawal , '' rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani told Reuters . He said government loyalists might be trying to stoke tensions between Misrata and neighboring towns , and that Gaddafi 's troops might return to the city later under the guise of intervening to protect local tribes from the rebels . Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim had said the army would `` leave it to the tribes and the people around Misrata to deal with the situation , whether by using force or using negotiations . '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague told the BBC he doubted Gaddafi 's forces were really going to withdraw . `` This may be cover for using more insurgent-type warfare without any uniforms and without tanks . '' Britain and France have been leading air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces in an operation mandated by the U.N. Security Council on March 17 to protect civilians in Libya . The United States has also deployed Predator drones , using the unmanned plane for the first time on Saturday to attack the site of a multiple rocket launcher near Misrata . Libyan state news agency Jana quoted a military source as saying the use of drones was aimed at political assassination . Western powers have been bombing Libyan positions for more than a month . The United States , Britain and France say they will not stop their air war until Gaddafi leaves power . JANA said on Saturday that Prime Minister al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi had spoken by telephone to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou .

The majority of Libyans would choose peace over democracy any day , but the West has made sure to transform an externally-orchestrated protest into an all-out civil war in order to take control of North Africa and drive out China and bring about the New Order . Naturally , as the civil war goes on , lives will be disrupted and people killed and others radicalized , and reconciliation becomes impossible , which is just what the West and the opportunist rebel leaders want -LRB- and the r gime was trying to avoid -RRB- . If the West truly cared about the civilian population of Libya , far from engineering and taking sides in a civil war , they should n't have orchestrated\\/supported the uprising in the first place , and the majority of the civilians in Libya would now be living a normal -LRB- and highly subsidized -RRB- life , just as they were doing a few months ago -LRB- while a powerful lite would continue to make huge profits from shady deals at the expense of the masses , which is also the case in Western `` democracies '' by the way -RRB- .

When Libya 's citizens -LRB- we call them rebels -RRB- say `` free '' they mean they have freedom of movement within the city . Gaddafi soldiers & mercenaries only moved to the outskirts of the city and are pounding the city indiscriminately with long range Grad Rockets . Gaddafi also laid mines or booby-traps explosives before pulling out , which leaves children playing in huge danger .

And there are few signs either of significant divisions within Muammar Gaddafi 's government that would hasten a political solution to the conflict . NATO , which took over the air campaign from a coalition led by France , Britain and the United States a month ago , can point to some successes in protecting civilian populations in eastern Libya from attack including in Benghazi and Ajdabiyah . But the siege of Misrata continues and the commander of the NATO operation , Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , conceded on Tuesday that the alliance had yet to remove the threat posed to civilians by Gaddafi 's forces . In the past week , a broadening of NATO 's bombing campaign to strikes on Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound , Washington 's announcement that it was deploying armed drones , and the withdrawal of government forces from central Misrata , might suggest the start of a shift away from a military stalemate . But analysts say these moves in part reflect a practical reality -- that an initial air campaign has run out of clear , purely military targets that are easy to hit without endangering civilians -- and the need for Western governments to maintain support for the effort by showing they are making a difference . `` Militarily , the fact is , the situation is not much different from what it was at the very beginning of the war , '' said French strategic analyst Francois Heisbourg . `` Gaddafi is essentially controlling the same territory as he was at the beginning of the war , so he is not likely to leave power readily as part of a negotiated deal . So from the standpoint of the coalition it 's not a great result . '' Shashank Joshi of London 's Royal United Services Institute said Gaddafi had shown himself a more adaptable and flexible adversary than the Western powers would have hoped . `` His forces have adapted extremely well , '' Joshi said . While there had been an escalation of the political aims of the Western mission , given the statement this month by the leaders of France , Britain and the United States pledging to continue the military campaign until Gaddafi gives up power , there was less sign of a stepping up of the military effort , Joshi said . `` People are synthesizing the bombing of Gaddafi 's compound and the introduction of drones and advisers to say this is an escalation . These are all incremental and will not make a difference in themselves . `` It 's actually a new way to compensate for the slowing of airstrikes , '' he said , referring to a decline in air activity since NATO took over the operation and the United States stepped back from an overt front-line role . Tomas Valasek of the Center for European Reform think tank said that despite NATO denials , it did appear the key alliance powers -- France , Britain and the United States -- were seeking a way around the Gaddafi dilemma by targeting him directly . `` NATO 's official mandate does n't involve removing Gaddafi from power , so the commanders would deny it and say they are going after communications posts and such , but to me it does smell that they are going after Gaddafi personally . `` That would mean a gap between what NATO collectively says it wants to do and what the French , the British and Americans say . That 's going to be a tough issue internally and it seems bound to create tensions within NATO , '' he said . Nick Witney of the European Council on Foreign Relations said French , British and U.S. leaders had put pressure on themselves by declaring their mission to be regime change . `` Unfortunately that 's something that can not be achieved by bombing , '' he said . `` There should be no particular time pressure on this , but you have to accept a war aim of disengagement , ceasefire and negotiations . It 's a mistake to conflate military action and regime change . '' Valasek said the fact that Britain , France and Italy were sending in military advisers showed they were aware they were unlikely to succeed quickly . `` It speaks of a long-term strategy , '' he said . `` They have a dilemma : there 's no end to the war without an end to the Gaddafi regime . And short of turning the rebels into a proper fighting force and supporting them from the air , there is no good way of forcing Gaddafi to resign . '' Any progress so far had been marginal , he said . `` To use a tug-of-war analogy , you are talking about a few inches left and right , '' he said . `` They 're still a mile way from the ultimate political end goal of removing Gaddafi from power .

Given the fact that Israel has historically prioritized the goal of having substantial influence in our U.S. government , I 'm wondering how the government is dealing with the fact that an Israeli corporation , reportedly charging $ 2,000 per African mercenary while paying the mercenary $ 100\\/day , is essentially turning what should have been a short conflict into an on-going business windfall . Likewise , I 'm wondering how it 's playing in Washington D.C. when the U.S. is sending U.S. pilots into a warzone whose Israeli-backed mercenaries are shooting at them while numerous pro-Israeli lobbyists , attorneys , government aides , and other Washington , D.C. influentials continue to shape policy concerning the war . If our purported friends are going to support our enemies then we need to determine who our friends really are before engaging in wars incapable of being won or assisting Israel in protecting itself against Middle East threats to it 's freedom and sovereignty only to watch it profiteer on the slaughter of students and civilians fighting for democratic freedom being choked by the grip of a mass-murdering psychopath . I was all for the U.S. assisting the rebels in fighting for democracy before I came to discover this unexpected obstacle . Now it appears as though this thing might very well drag out for years and years as we continue to send young , naive military personnel into a war knowing they are likely to be killed or wounded by our friends working against us . I 've never understood our relationship with Israel to begin with though I suspect it 's largely a product of Israeli influence within our own government . If that 's the case , then we need to identify pro-Israeli individuals who , by virtue of their political leanings , have a conflict of interest if they also occupy an influential or sensitive position within our own government or it 's civilian support system . Allowing someone to influence war decisions who is closely allied with the primary backer of our enemy is the grossest form of negligence . When a U.S. pilot is shot down with Israeli equipment and mercenaries , there will be no excuse that could work from any part of the Administration . If the government chooses to commit innocent military personnel to this good cause knowing that it will continue because Israel will continue support , then it is knowingly sending our young citizens into a perpetual meat grinder . You know how those work , do n't you ? Take a look at Viet Nam , Iraq , Afghanistan ? , and other protracted wars that took far longer than expected to reach a failing conclusion . This is the kind of BS that the American public is wretchedly disgusted with . It is the type of behavior that makes U.S. Citizens blindly enraged about our government . With the economy as it is , we might very well be the next country to have a revolution if our government becomes any more abusive of the poor and middle classes . What international friend would the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries call upon for help this time as the Founding Fathers did some 235 years ago by sending Benjamin Franklin to France to plead for assistance in rebelling against the British ? Could the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries count on France again to provide the support that changed the outcome of the Revolutionary War in 1776 and stopped the abuses of the British government ? It 's certainly possible again , I suppose . The French still love to love but they also love a good fight when it 's about right and wrong . They 're in Libya now spearheading the alliance . Could the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries count on Israel to help free them from an abusive government ? The first question one should ask is , what is NATO doing in this Libyo-Libyan war ? It is clearly a civil war . Why should NATO be involved in it ? Why should NATO side towards the rebels ? Why does NATO want to kill Khadafi ? One thing is clear , NATO is not involved in this civil war to protect the civilians . This is an excuse for intervention but is not the true reason , otherwise NATO should be involved in the unrest of other countries including Syria . NATO 's interest is purely economic ? Has Khadafi refused to renew or extend any oil contract with Britain ? This might be the case . Is Khadafi 's involvement in some African satellite communication projects affecting major communication companies in Europe ? Again , this seems to be the case . So , it might be that the involvement of NATO is a chastisement operation designed to punish Khadafi for not extending an oil contract and to cut down the revenues of a European communication company . And in this chastisement operation , thousands of Libyans have been killed by NATO bombs and billions of dollars ' worth of Libyan assets have been destroyed . Has NATO the right to kill people and destroy assets that belong to Libya ? Is this not a crime that should be severely punished ? This discussion is now closed .

ADDIS ABABA | Tue Apr 26 , 2011 10:37 am EDT ADDIS ABABA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The African Union on Tuesday accused Western nations of undermining its efforts to find a homegrown solution to the Libya conflict and said the civil war was in danger of becoming a stalemate . Libya 's foreign minister Abdelati Obeidi and representatives for the rebels have been meeting separately with AU officials in the Ethiopian capital since Monday to discuss an end to the war in the north African nation . `` I would like to point out that the pursuit of other agendas in Libya , by non-African actors , has had an impact on the implementation of the AU roadmap , '' Ramtane Lamamra , AU 's Commissioner for Peace and Security , told AU foreign ministers . `` Attempts have been made to marginalise an African solution to the crisis , specifically the timely implementation of the AU roadmap in a way that is fully consistent with and complementary to U.N. Security Council resolutions , '' he said in an open session . The war has split the oil producer , Africa 's fourth biggest , into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ragged but dedicated rebels . The AU has rejected any form of outside intervention and proposed a solution that calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a transitional period and political dialogue . The rebels rejected the plan earlier this month , saying any settlement must include the departure of Muammar Gaddafi and his sons . The Libyan leader has vowed to fight to the death . Gaddafi is one of the AU 's most influential members , both ideologically and financially . As chair of the bloc in 2009 , he pushed for closer integration of member states , and he has been paying membership fees for several small countries who subscribe to the group . `` The imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya and aerial bombardment by the coalition , and now by NATO , have not brought a solution to the crisis , '' Lamamra said . `` In fact , the military situation on the ground seems to be sliding into a stalemate .

U.S. Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz said deepening contacts with the Benghazi-based Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- showed it was `` a political body which is worthy of our support '' although not yet full diplomatic recognition . `` They continue to say the right things . They are reaching out to the international community . They 're trying to be as inclusive as possible , '' Cretz , who is working in Washington to coordinate policy on the Libyan conflict , told reporters . The United States this week took steps to boost aid to the opposition council and to approve oil exports made under its auspices , creating a loophole in U.S. sanctions that could mean millions of dollars in revenue for rebel coffers . The order by the Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control covers oil transactions handled through Qatar Petroleum , which has agreed to help market oil for the council , or the Vitol group of companies . The order may help to clear up concerns among potential buyers over legal complications related to ownership of Libyan oil and the impact of international sanctions . A tanker with the first major oil shipment from rebel-held territory is expected to arrive in Singapore on Thursday for refueling before heading to China . The Treasury 's move on Libyan oil came as President Barack Obama on Tuesday approved the release of up to $ 25 million in nonlethal U.S. supplies and other aid to support groups , including the TNC , protecting civilians threatened by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . The assistance , which could include items such as radios and military uniforms , comes atop some $ 47 million in U.S. emergency relief aimed at alleviating the humanitarian crisis caused by Libya 's civil war . Despite the increased assistance , Cretz said the United States had still not made a decision on formally recognizing the TNC -- a step that key allies including France , Italy and Qatar have already taken . Senator John McCain , on a recent visit to Libya , urged the Obama administration to give full recognition to the council and to transfer frozen Libyan assets to them . But Cretz said the United States was still studying the legal and procedural implications of such a move . A U.S. special envoy to the TNC , Chris Stevens , has been in Benghazi meeting with council leaders including Mustafa Abdel Jalil and military chief of staff Abdel Fattah Younes al Abidi who are spearheading the rebel drive to oust Gaddafi . `` They are working through the normal bugs that would be part of any stand-up transitional government ... in a country where you have not had politics for 40 years , '' Cretz said . `` As our mission is able to provide us more information , we will be looking at the different things that we might be able to do to step up cooperation . '' Cretz said other assistance , including possible arms transfers , remained under consideration but that no decision had yet been taken . Cretz said the United States and its allies continued to hear from members of Gaddafi 's government who wanted to break with the leader but were too terrified to do so . `` The time is fast approaching where they have to make the decision , and they can make a decision to either go down with the ship or else change sides , '' he said . -LRB- Editing by John O'Callaghan and Cynthia Osterman -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The struggle between forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his more than four decades of rule drew in outsiders last month , as NATO began air strikes on government troops under a United Nations mandate . But on Thursday the fighting spilled over Libya 's land frontier , when Gaddafi troops battled rebels on Tunisian territory for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing . The incursion was brief and limited , and Gaddafi 's troops even apologised locally . But the response was nevertheless furious from Tunisia , where the Arab world 's wave of uprisings began late last year , leading to the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January . Illustrating the difficulty of keeping the Libyan conflict sealed within the country 's land borders , artillery shells fired by Gaddafi forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing . Rebels seized the post a week ago , as it controls the only road link which their comrades in Libya 's Western Mountains have with the outside world , making them rely otherwise on rough tracks for supplies of food , fuel and medicine . After weeks of advances and retreats by rebel and government forces along the Mediterranean coast , fighting has settled into a pattern of clashes and skirmishes . Thursday 's battle for the crossing between Dehiba in Tunisia and Wazin on the Libyan side was typical of the fluid and confused conflict , which broke out in mid-February . First government troops stormed the post in what appeared to be part of a broader offensive to root out rebel outposts beyond their eastern heartland around Benghazi , Libya 's second city . Gaddafi 's soldiers apologised to their Tunisian counterparts for the incursion and hoisted their flag at the border , tearing down a pre-Gaddafi era flag that had fluttered for a few days . But then the rebels , who had retreated into Tunisia , counter-attacked and as the fog of war descended , rumors spread that the post was back in their hands . In the confusion , scores of vehicles headed for the border from the Tunisian side with civilians on board shouting `` We 've won ! We 've won ! '' but they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi 's forces were still there . In the port city of Misrata , the rebels ' biggest enclave in western Libya , the plight of residents worsened . Rebels accused Gaddafi 's forces of firing bigger rockets than the Russian-made Grad missiles largely used until now . A rebel called Marwan said in an audio statement on YouTube that the bigger rockets cause much greater destruction . `` Gaddafi the tyrant is trying to wipe out the city of Misrata , '' he said . Gaddafi denies his forces are attacking civilians and says his opponents are Islamist militants and foreign-backed agitators who deliberately put non-combatants in harm 's way . Rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said from Misrata that there had been sporadic clashes on the road to the port and shelling of residential areas . `` Those areas are packed with civilians who fled the fighting in the city center , '' he said . `` The ball is now in NATO 's court . After Gaddafi 's soldiers and snipers were driven out from the city center and Tripoli Street by the rebel fighters , their strategy has been to shell the city from the outskirts . This can only be solved by NATO . '' The Western alliance has been conducting air strikes on Libya since last month under a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for civilians to be protected . But military deadlock in Libya has exposed growing international rifts , with critics of NATO bombing calling it another case of the West trying to overthrow a government by stretching the terms of a U.N. resolution . At least two loud explosions were heard in Tripoli on Thursday night and NATO jets rumbled overhead . It was not immediately clear what the targets were . The official Libyan news agency Jana also said that `` the colonial , crusader aggression '' hit civilian and military sites in a Western Mountains region town on Thursday evening . Two people were killed and many others were wounded , it said . Gaddafi forces also took a town in the remote southeastern desert , state television reported . `` Libyan forces have seized full control of the town of Kufra and purified it of the armed gangs , '' it quoted a military spokesman as saying . But rebels denied this . `` The battle is not over and the situation is unclear , '' said spokesman Mohamed al-Muntasser .

TRIPOLI | Sun May 1 , 2011 6:03 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya said Sunday Muammar Gaddafi 's youngest son and three grandchildren were killed in a NATO air strike and Britain said that while it was not targeting the leader , it was homing in on his military machine . Libyan government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said Gaddafi was unharmed and in good health despite what he called `` a direct operation to assassinate the leader of this country . '' The deaths have not been independently confirmed . But they will be sure to heap pressure on NATO from critics who say it is overstepping a U.N. mandate to protect Libyan civilians and could trigger a backlash against the West and a renewed government push against rebels supported by the strikes . Britain and Italy 's embassies in Tripoli were attacked after Gaddafi loyalists were shown on Libyan television vowing vengeance following the air strike . Britain expelled the Libyan ambassador and Italy condemned the attack on its embassy as a grave and vile act . Most Western countries closed their embassies in Tripoli before the NATO military intervention began several weeks ago . Libyan officials took journalists to a Tripoli house that had been hit by at least three missiles . The roof had collapsed in places . Glass and debris covered the lawns and what appeared to be an unexploded missile lay in one corner . `` What we have now is the law of the jungle , '' Ibrahim said . `` We think now it is clear to everyone that what is happening in Libya has nothing to do with the protection of civilians . '' Libya 's civil war , which grew out street demonstrations for greater political freedoms that have rippled across the Arab world , has reached stalemate in recent weeks . NATO denied targeting Gaddafi , or his family , but said in a statement it had launched air strikes on military targets in the same area of Tripoli as the bombed site seen by reporters . Ibrahim said Gaddafi 's youngest son , Saif al-Arab , was killed in the attack . Saif al-Arab , 29 , is one of Gaddafi 's less prominent sons , with a limited role in the power structure . Ibrahim described him as a student who had studied in Germany . Al Arabiya Sunday broadcast footage taken from Libyan Jamahiriyah TV which it said were the bodies of Saif al-Arab and the three children -- two 2-year-olds and a five-month-old . They were wrapped in green cloth with their faces covered in white . `` NATO continued its precision strikes against regime military installations in Tripoli overnight , including striking a known command and control building in the Bab al-Aziziyah neighborhood shortly after 1800 GMT Saturday , '' NATO said . NATO 's commander of Libya operations , Canadian Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , said the target was part of a strategy to hit command centers that threaten civilians . `` All NATO 's targets are military in nature ... We do not target individuals , '' he said in a statement . `` I am aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of Gaddafi 's family members may have been killed . We regret all loss of life . '' Any appearance of an assassination attempt against Gaddafi is likely to lead to accusations that the British - and French-led strikes are exceeding the provisions of the U.N. resolution to protect civilians . British Prime Minister David Cameron declined to comment on what he also called the `` unconfirmed report . '' But he told BBC television : `` The targeting policy of NATO and the alliance is absolutely clear . It is in line with U.N. Resolution 1973 and it is about preventing a loss of civilian life by targeting Gaddafi 's war-making machine . So that is obviously tanks and guns , rocket launchers , but also command and control as well . '' The French Foreign Ministry said : `` France is following its mandate from the U.N. Security Council and there is no question of regime change or targeting individuals in the resolution . '' Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a long-time ally of Gaddafi , called the attack attempted murder . Gaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , is fighting an uprising by rebels who have seized much of eastern Libya . He describes the rebels as religious extremists and Western agents who seek to control Libya 's oil . Saturday night 's attack appeared to be the second NATO strike near to Gaddafi in 24 hours . A missile struck near a television station early Saturday when the Libyan leader was making an address in which he said he would never step down and offered talks to rebels . The rebels say they can not trust Gaddafi . Gaddafi 's daughter was killed in a U.S. air strike in 1986 , ordered after a bomb attack on a West Berlin discotheque killed two U.S. servicemen . Washington linked Tripoli to the attack . Tripoli has declared a sea blockade on the besieged western outpost of Misrata , potentially stopping the rebels from sending weapons and humanitarian supplies in from their eastern heartland . An International Organization for Migration ship , the Red Star One , was waiting offshore to deliver aid and evacuate migrants . A rebel spokesman reported more shelling in Misrata . `` The bombardment started last night . It is still going on , '' the spokesman , called Reda , told Reuters by telephone . `` The random bombardment targeted residential areas and the port area . I can hear explosions now . '' Rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan said later that the Libyan army was shelling where an aid ship was trying to unload . Libyan TV said government forces were trying to stop a NATO arms delivery to `` armed criminal gangs . '' A third rebel spokesman said government forces and rebels were fighting for control of the airport near Misrata . Pockets of fighting continued elsewhere in the west . Government forces were bombarding Zintan with rockets to try to advance on the rebel-held city southwest of Tripoli , and the rebels said NATO was bombing Libyan army positions nearby . Loyalists ' artillery fire also landed in the Tunisian border town of Dehiba after fighting on the Libyan side of the border . A rebel spokesman and an oil official said an air strike destroyed a Gaddafi convoy after his forces killed five civilians in fighting in the eastern towns of Jalu and Awlijah . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It is a war . two wrongs do n't make a right . Even if Gaddafi is wrong in do many areas , killing children is never right . Did n't NATO pledge not to target the Libyan leader for bombing ? Why they do it now ? The rebels can overthrow Gaddafi by themselves but they will not be accredited for completing this job if NATO lends such helping hand . We want the war , if persists , to go fair . Gaddafi should have offered surrender instead of ceasefire yesterday so his son would n't die for him . NATO did this becoz the West is not patient with continued disrupted cheap oil supply from Libya . This discussion is now closed .

'' Gaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , is fighting an uprising by rebels who have seized much of the eastern part of the country . British and French-led NATO forces are permitted under a United Nations resolution to mount air attacks on Gaddafi forces to protect civilians . There was no immediate NATO reaction or any independent confirmation of the deaths . Gaddafi had appeared on television in the early hours of Saturday and said he would never step down . He offered talks to the rebels , who rejected the proposal as hollow and treacherous . Libya 's government took journalists to the house , which had been hit by at least three missiles . The roof had completely caved in in some areas , leaving mangled rods of reinforcing steel hanging down among chunks of concrete . A table football machine stood outside in the garden of the house , in a wealthy residential area of Tripoli . Glass and debris covered the lawns and what appeared to be an unexploded missile lay in one corner . Inside one part of the villa , a beige corner sofa was virtually untouched , but debris had caved in on other striped upholstered chairs . The blasts had been heard across the city late on Saturday . Rifle fire and car horns rang out in the rebels ' eastern capital of Benghazi as news of the attack spread . `` The leader himself is in good health . He was n't harmed , '' Ibrahim said . `` His wife is also in good health . `` This was a direct operation to assassinate the leader of this country . This is not permitted by international law . It is not permitted by any moral code or principle . '' He said Gaddafi 's youngest son , Saif Al-Arab , had been killed in the attack . Saif al-Arab , 29 , is one of Gaddafi 's less prominent sons , with a limited role in the power structure . Ibrahim described him as a student who had studied in Germany . `` We will fight and fight if we have to , '' Ibrahim said . `` The leader offered peace to NATO yesterday and NATO rejected it . '' Fighting in Libya 's civil war , which grew from protests for greater political freedom that have spread across the Arab world , has reached stalemate in recent weeks with neither side capable of achieving a decisive blow . Libyan forces had reached the gates of Benghazi last month when Gaddafi appeared on television declaring he would crush the rebellion , showing `` no pity , no mercy . '' Days later the United Nations passed its resolution allowing the air strikes and saving the rebels from defeat . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously in February to refer Gaddafi 's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrators to The Hague-based ICC and Moreno-Ocampo said his first recommendations for indictments should reach ICC judges within weeks . `` We have strong evidence on the beginning of the conflict , the shooting of civilians , '' he told Reuters in an interview , noting that killing unarmed civilians would qualify as a crime against humanity . `` Also , we have strong evidence of the crime of persecution , '' he said . This includes `` massive arrests and torture of people , and some forced disappearances ... -LRB- for -RRB- talking to journalists or going to demonstrations . '' Without giving precise details of his proof , Moreno-Ocampo said `` for these two crimes we have a lot of evidence . '' He plans to brief the Security Council on his probe on Wednesday . Once Moreno-Ocampo makes his recommendations to the ICC 's pretrial chamber , the judges must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to issue arrest warrants . Moreno-Ocampo said he would initially ask for up to five arrest warrants , but disclosed no names . It is not clear whether NATO would be involved in the implementation of any future warrants . The Security Council has a mandate to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . Enforcing ICC warrants would require it to target individuals for capture and transfer them to The Hague . Permanent veto-wielding council members Russia and China have become increasingly critical of the U.N.-backed intervention to protect civilians in Libya . U.N. diplomats say Moscow and Beijing have complained privately and publicly that the operation is targeting Gaddafi and his family . The ICC is also looking at the rebel camp , which has been fighting Gaddafi 's forces since February in what is now a full-scale civil war that Western officials say is deadlocked . Moreno-Ocampo said the court was probing allegations that the rebels attacked black Africans in Libya , whom they assumed to be mercenaries aiding Gaddafi 's forces . Western officials and Libyan rebels have said that nationals from Chad , Niger and other African states have been among the mercenaries in Libya . The rebels have pledged to cooperate with the ICC , Moreno-Ocampo said , while Gaddafi 's government has not responded to the court 's requests for information . ICC investigators are also looking into allegations that Gaddafi 's forces have used rape as a weapon . As part of the investigation of alleged rapes , Moreno-Ocampo said , the ICC is looking at allegations that some of Gaddafi 's soldiers have been issued packets of the popular anti-impotence drug Viagra from Pfizer Inc. . U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice brought the Viagra charge up in a meeting of the Security Council last week , council diplomats said . If it were true that Gaddafi 's troops were being issued Viagra , diplomats said , it could indicate they were being encouraged by their commanders to engage in rape to terrorize the population in areas that have supported the rebels . `` We are trying to confirm this public announcement through evidence so it can stand in court , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . `` In some other conflicts you have had some battalions that are just devoted to rape . '' He said the ICC was investigating other alleged war crimes charges against Gaddafi 's forces , including the use of cluster bombs in civilian areas .

Rebels said they expected billions of dollars in credit soon from Western governments to feed and supply their territories in the east and support their campaign against Gaddafi . Refugees fleeing western Libya have said the danger of starvation is growing in some besieged towns . Zintan has been heavily shelled , and aid deliveries to the port of Misrata have been hindered by artillery fire and a mine near the harbor entrance . Rebel spokesmen said fighting had flared again in Misrata 's eastern suburbs , near the port that provides the besieged city with a lifeline to the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi . `` Fighting is taking place in the area of Bourouia . The -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- brigades are trying to enter the Tamina area , east of the city , '' one spokesmen , Reda , told Reuters by telephone . Gaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , has not been seen in public since a NATO missile attack on Saturday on a house in Tripoli which officials say he survived but which killed his youngest son and three grandchildren . U.S. intelligence officials believe Gaddafi is still alive . '' -LRB- The -RRB- best intelligence we have is that he 's still alive , '' CIA Director Leon Panetta told NBC television .

Most are women and children , '' UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told a news briefing in Geneva . Tens of thousands have already fled . A violent sandstorm that battered the area had made the situation more difficult . The Dehiba crossing point has changed hands several times in the last week , with fighting spilling over onto Tunisian soil . `` UNHCR and our partners are struggling to maintain nearby camps . The storm has destroyed hundreds of tents and two huge portable warehouses , '' Edwards said . `` Most of the Libyan refugees are leaving Libya in tribal groups . Many are choosing to stay in the camps for a few days before moving on to stay with Tunisian families , '' he said . Meanwhile , more people have been fleeing Libya by sea to Italy , after a 10-day break due to bad weather . Some 3,200 have arrived on the island of Lampedusa over the past five days , most of them from sub-Saharan Africa , according to the UNHCR .

Critics say NATO has already overstepped its mandate with Saturday night 's attack on the Tripoli house . NATO insists it targets only military installations and was not attempting to assassinate the Libyan leader . NATO minesweepers searched the approaches of Misrata harbor on Monday for a drifting mine blocking aid supplies . A NATO statement said the alliance had destroyed two of three mines laid by government forces . It said the mines were small and hard to detect but capable of doing serious damage . The International Organization for Migration said an aid ship was still waiting off Misrata for bombing to stop and mines to be cleared before it tried to deliver supplies and evacuate some 1,000 foreigners and wounded Libyans .

Unfortunately , the Libian civilians are endangered and killed not just by Gaddafi forces , but as much by the rebels who insist on continuing a civil war which they ca n't win , in hope that it would be fought to success by Nato . The crimes against humanity are committed by all three parties , Gaddafi , the rebels and Nato . Not exactly a recommendation for Nato . That is of course what the US anticipated and why it deferred command of the intervention to Nato which by now is no more than a euphemism for the US . IN what world does Obama think his own children will be able to live when they grow up ? Obama , the US & NATO are trying to protect civilians who 's only crime was marching for their right to self determination . Gaddafi 's indiscriminate bombing & murder of these civilians is what brought Libya to the state it 's in today -- not the US , NATO or Obama . The actions of the NATO & the US under Obama should be commended . They have shown remarkable restraint in trying to prevent escalation of this conflict . If Gaddafi wants NATO out , let him lay down his weapons . If he is as popular as he thinks he is , let him hold an internationally supervised , fair election -- he should have no problem getting elected . He 's a dictator fighting for power .

At the same time , Russian and South African U.N. envoys sharply criticized the NATO-led operations to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone , and suggested the ICC should not limit its investigation to Gaddafi 's government . ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo , addressing the U.N. Security Council , said he will request three arrest warrants within weeks for alleged crimes against humanity in Libya . Moreno-Ocampo is investigating Gaddafi , some of his sons and aides over what he called a `` predetermined plan '' to attack protesters , after the U.N. Security Council referred the Libyan violence to the ICC in February . `` Crimes against humanity have been and continue to be committed in Libya , attacking unarmed civilians -- including killings and persecutions in many cities across Libya , '' Moreno-Ocampo said in a statement . He urged states to be ready to make arrests should an ICC judges issue the warrants , stressing `` now is the time to start planning on how to implement possible arrest warrants . '' Moreno-Ocampo gave no details on whose arrest he would seek . But several U.N. diplomats and independent human rights experts said Moreno-Ocampo , whose probe of alleged genocide in Sudan 's Darfur region led to the indictment of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir , might want Gaddafi 's arrest . `` We believe it is possible that Gaddafi could be included among the requested arrest warrants , '' said a spokeswoman in The Hague for the International Federation of Human Rights . Moreno-Ocampo said his request for warrants would be based on `` strong evidence , '' which he said would include photographs , video footage and the testimony of government insiders . The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to enforce arrests . Despite NATO bombing operations intended to protect civilians , Libya has been plunged into civil war , seriously complicating efforts to arrest ICC suspects . Libya is not an ICC member state and is therefore not obligated to arrest the court 's suspects . Security Council powers the United States , Russia and China are not ICC members either , but voted in favor of referring Libya to the ICC . The issue of enforcing ICC warrants is expected to come up at a meeting of a broad coalition of nations aligned against Gaddafi in Rome on Thursday , U.N. envoys told Reuters . Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin criticized the NATO-led airstrikes and urged members of the coalition to adhere strictly to Security Council resolution 1973 , which authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . Churkin said Moscow was `` deeply alarmed '' by the growing number of civilian casualties in Libya . He referred to the recent bombings in Tripoli , one of which killed Gaddafi 's son . `` Going beyond the mandate of 1973 in any way , and any disproportionate use of force , is unacceptable , '' he said . South African Deputy Ambassador Doctor Mashabane suggested NATO should not be immune from an ICC investigation . `` It is our sincere hope in considering the evidence , the office of the prosecutor will consider any actions that may have been committed in the purported implementation of resolution 1973 , '' he told the council . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The US , China and Russia are not members of the ICC and do not recognize its authority but voted to refer the matter to the ICC and ignore the Coalition 's targeting for assassination children in their homes . How can a non-member have the right to vote ? The Coalition used to be amusing but now are downright Pathetic Thugs . Many more will die from this so-called Bungled humanitarian intervention into the affairs of a sovereign nation for oil than if they had just declared a war or stayed out . These Leaders do nothing but make a mockery of the UN and Peace . This action , makes a mockery of the ICC , which I suspect , is the intention in the first place . Here we have the U.S. Administration ` ordering ' it 's military to committ extrajudicial murder from the air , infringing on another nations soveriegnity and murdering innocent men , women and children , destroying infrastructure of nations which have not lifted a finger against the U.S. yet not ONE official within the U.S. Administration , past or present , has ever been charged by the I.C.C. for the whole sale murder and mayhem that the U.S. unleashes on innocent people on a daily basis . Even the murder of OBL , which was against ever law ever written , and the I.C.C. utters not a word . So who is it really , who is behind these charges emanting from the I.C.C. ? It would seem , they pick their targets who invariably are always a thorn in the side of the U.S. Administration .

Sudan shares an almost 400-km-long -LRB- 240-mile -RRB- border with Libya where a civil war against leader Muammar Gaddafi has split the desert state into a government-held western area around the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by rebels . `` We deployed troops at the border to Libya because we are worried about arms smuggling -LRB- to rebels -RRB- , '' Khalid Musa , spokesman for the Sudanese foreign ministry , said . Sudan closed the Libyan consulate in al-Fasher in Darfur and asked staff to leave within 48 hours after Libya had closed the Sudanese consulate in the eastern town of al-Kufrah , Musa said . `` We summoned the Libyan ambassador for an explanation why the consulate was closed but his answer came too late and was not satisfactory so we closed the Libyan consulate , '' he said . There is little love lost between Gaddafi and Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir , who was indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide and other war crimes in Darfur . Relations were strained between Libya and Sudan after Gaddafi agreed to offer refuge to Darfur rebel Justice and Equality Movement chief Khalil Ibrahim , who had left peace talks in Qatar to return to fighting in Darfur . Last year , Libya promised to curb any Darfur rebel attacks . Gaddafi hosted and helped insurgents early in the Darfur conflict , which began in 2003 when mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms , accusing Khartoum of neglect .

Aid workers had earlier scrambled to embark the migrants , along with journalists and the wounded , on the ship bound for rebel-held Benghazi as the Misrata port came under bombardment from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi . `` The bombing has caused so many casualties among Libyans and people of other nationalities waiting for evacuation , '' Gemal Salem , a rebel spokesman , told Reuters . `` So far we have five killed and ambulances are rushing to the scene . '' The Red Star One , sent by the International Organisation for Migration , picked up 800 people caught up in the civil war who had been waiting for days to escape Misrata 's worsening humanitarian crisis . It had hoped to take 1,000 people . `` Hundreds of Libyan civilians had also tried to board the ship in desperation to get out of Misrata . But with a limited capacity , the ramp of the boat had to be pulled up so that the ship could pull away from the dock in safety , '' the IOM said . The shelling was also hitting Misrata 's Qasr Ahmad district , a mixed residential and industrial area which houses the iron and steel works in a city that has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the two-month conflict . Another rebel spokesman , Abdelsalem , said the five killed were African migrant workers . He said fighting was continuing in the southern neighborhood of al-Ghiran , where rebels say pro-Gaddafi forces have been trying to advance on the city center , and in Zawiyat al-Mahjoub to the west . The port is a lifeline for Misrata , where food and medical supplies are low and snipers shoot from rooftops . Other rescue ships are offshore but there was no news of their movements . About 12,000 people have so far been rescued by 12 ships . Minesweepers from the NATO coalition , whose aircraft have been bombing Libyan government military targets under a United Nations resolution , had been searching the approaches to the harbor since Monday for a drifting Gaddafi forces ' mine . The United States Wednesday condemned the continued shelling of Misrata and called on Gaddafi 's forces to permit the IOM to resume evacuating wounded people from the port . The civil war over Gaddafi 's 41-year rule has split the oil-producing desert state into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ill-disciplined but dedicated rebel forces . The insurgents had hoped for a swift overthrow of Gaddafi . But his better-trained and better-equipped forces halted the westward rebel advance from their stronghold of Benghazi and a standoff in the fighting has prevailed since then . The United States , Britain and France , leading a NATO air campaign , say they will not stop until Gaddafi is toppled . International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said he would request three arrest warrants for his investigation into the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators . `` Crimes against humanity have been and continue to be committed in Libya , attacking unarmed civilians including killings and persecutions in many cities across Libya . '' At a U.N. Security Council meeting , Russia criticised the NATO campaign , saying it was using disproportionate force , and South Africa said the international court should also scrutinise the Western alliance for potential war crimes . NATO officers met Wednesday in Brussels to review their operation 's progress , rejecting assessments of stalemate on the battlefield despite their warplanes ' intervention , as nations prepared for a meeting in Rome Thursday over rebel finances . NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the meeting a `` reaffirmation of the strong commitment to our operation , '' adding that he sensed no fatigue among the allies , while Gaddafi 's forces were weaker than when the NATO campaign began . Gaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , has not been seen in public since a NATO missile attack Saturday on a house in Tripoli , which Libyan officials said killed his youngest son and three grandchildren . Officials said he was in good health . '' -LRB- The -RRB- best intelligence we have is that he -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is still alive , '' CIA Director Leon Panetta told NBC News . Libyan state television said Wednesday that NATO forces bombed Al-Hayrah , west of the capital , causing casualties . `` The colonialist , crusader alliance has just bombed Al-Hayrah a short while ago , causing human casualties and damage to infrastructure , '' the broadcaster said . Libya 's army also fired volleys of rockets at the rebel-held town of Zintan in the Western Mountains , pressing on with a campaign that has forced thousands to flee the country . Rebels said more than 40 Grad rockets hit Zintan late Tuesday . The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said an exodus from the Western Mountains region had resumed , with Libyan families fleeing into southern Tunisia . `` This past weekend , more than 8,000 people , most of them ethnic Berbers , arrived in Dehiba in southern Tunisia . Most are women and children , '' UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told a news briefing in Geneva . Tens of thousands have already fled . While a few rebel pockets such as Zintan and Misrata resist Gaddafi 's forces in western Libya , in the largely rebel-held east the most pressing need is for cash . Rebels say they expect up to three billion dollars in credit soon from Western governments to feed and supply their territories in the east . With Libya 's economy in turmoil , funds to pay for food , medicine and the state salaries on which most people depend are running low . Securing financing for rebels and facilitating contacts with defectors will be the focus of Libya talks in Rome Thursday , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . Juppe told France 24 television the meeting of the so-called `` Contact Group '' on Libya , including Western and Middle Eastern countries , the United Nations , the African Union and the Arab League , would discuss setting up a financing mechanism . `` It 's not easy . There are Libyan assets that are frozen and for legal reasons unfreezing them is difficult , '' Juppe said . Juppe said another aim of the Rome meeting would be to build contacts with defectors from Gaddafi 's government and officials who want to leave it . `` There are a lot of officials from Tripoli who want to talk . We are going to try to coordinate , '' he said . The revolt in Libya is the bloodiest yet against long-entrenched rulers across the Middle East and North Africa .

Security Council . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi said the two nations -- both permanent Security Council members with veto power -- would work together to seek stability in the Middle East and North African region . Russia and China , which abstained in the Security Council vote that authorized military intervention in Libya to protect civilians , have criticized the Western-led coalition conducting air strikes . Russia has accused it of overstepping its mandate . After talks with Yang in Moscow , Lavrov criticized the Libya contact group of Western and Arab countries that agreed on Thursday to provide Libya 's eastern rebels , based in Benghazi , with millions of dollars in non-military aid to help them keep services and the economy running . The contact group includes the other three veto-wielding permanent U.N. Security Council members -- the United States , Britain and France -- as well as Italy , Qatar , Kuwait and Jordan . The contact group `` is increasing its efforts to take on the leading role in determining the policy of the international community in relation to Libya , '' Lavrov told a news conference . `` We proceed from the position that the informal contact group comprises responsible states and that all of them ratified the U.N. Charter and are required to respect the authority of the Security Council . '' Lavrov said the conflict in Libya was a civil war and the international community should focus on stopping the fighting and not `` taking sides . '' Russia and China `` will coordinate our actions to foster the swiftest possible stabilization '' in the Arab world , he said . Yang , who also met President Dmitry Medvedev , said the `` sovereignty , independence and unity of Libya must be respected . People of all countries of the world ... have the right to choose their path of development . '' He reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire in order to prevent `` a great humanitarian catastrophe in Libya . '' Lavrov made clear that if asked , Moscow would not approve an international ground operation in Libya . The Security Council resolution that authorized military intervention in Libya `` directly and unequivocally rules out '' ground operations , Lavrov said , when asked whether the council might authorize such intervention . `` The position of the Russian Federation remains absolutely unchanged , '' he said . -LRB- Reporting by Thomas Grove , writing by Steve Gutterman , editing by Janet Lawrence -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "118", "dct": "2011-05-07", "dates": ["2011-05-06", "2011-05-07", "2011-05-07", "2011-05-07", "2011-04-01", "2011-05-07", "2011-05-07", "2011-05-07", "2011-05-07", "2011-03-01", "1970-01-01", "1973-01-01"], "text": "EDITOR 'S NOTE : Credit : Reuters IS UNABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE CONTENT OF THE VIDEO FROM WHICH THIS VIDEO WAS TAKEN . A fire-fighter attempts to put out a blaze at fuel storage tanks in Misrata in this still image taken from video uploaded on a social media website May 6 , 2011 . REUTERS\\/Social Media Website via Reuters TV TRIPOLI | Sat May 7 , 2011 7:30 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan government forces destroyed four fuel storage tanks and set several others ablaze in rebel-held Misrata , dealing a blow to the port city 's ability to withstand a government siege , rebels said on Saturday . The bombardment of the western city came as artillery rounds fired by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fell in Tunisia in an escalation of fighting near the border with rebels trying to end Gaddafi 's rule of more than four decades . Misrata , the last remaining city in the west under rebel control , has been under siege for more than two months and has witnessed some of the war 's fiercest fighting . Rebels gave varying accounts of the bombardment but said the attack hit fuel used for export as well as domestic consumption . `` Four -LRB- fuel -RRB- tanks were totally destroyed and a huge fire erupted which spread now to the other four . We can not extinguish it because we do not have the right tools , '' rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan told Reuters . `` Now the city will face a major problem . Those were the only sources of fuel for the city . These tanks could have kept the city for three months with enough fuel , '' he said by telephone . Video of the incident posted on YouTube by Libyan students in Misrata showed firefighters turning water hoses on a raging fire in a vain attempt to extinguish it . Hassan said rebels notified NATO about the planes before the attack but there had been no response . Government forces last month flew at least one helicopter reconnaissance mission over Misrata , according to rebels . NATO coalition aircraft have been bombing Libyan government military targets and enforcing a no-fly zone under a U.N. resolution . Western and Arab countries this week agreed to provide rebels with millions of dollars in non-military aid to help them keep services and the economy running . Rebels have long been demanding they also need more heavy weapons to take on the Libyan leader 's better-armed and trained forces . On Saturday , the rebels said they had reached an agreement with Italy to supply them with weapons , but the former colonial power denied the report . Abdel-Hafiz Ghoga , spokesman for the rebel Transitional National Council , told journalists at a news conference in Benghazi that the weapons would be supplied to the rebels soon . In Rome , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said no such agreement had been reached . `` There has been no agreement to supply them with weapons , '' the spokesman told Reuters . Italy has thrown its full support behind the rebels , formally recognizing the transitional council as the only legitimate representatives of the country , but it is unlikely it would go further than other countries in the anti-Gaddafi coalition . Fighting has intensified in Libya 's Western Mountains region as Gaddafi loyalists and rebels , backed by NATO bombing , reached stalemate on other fronts in the civil war . Government forces surrounding the rebel-held Zintan fired 300 rockets into the town on Saturday , rebel spokesman Abdulrahman al-Zintani said . He gave no details of casualties in Zintan , which is largely empty of civilians . `` NATO aircraft can be heard but there have been no air strikes , '' al-Zintani told Reuters . The Tunisian town of Dehiba has been hit repeatedly by stray shells in recent weeks , and on Saturday Tunisia condemned the `` extremely dangerous '' shelling and said it would take all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty . The Libyan government denied it targeted Tunisian soil deliberately . `` We said this -LRB- shelling -RRB- was an error and we have apologized that this took place and have asked the military forces to ensure this does n't happen again , '' Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi told a news conference in Tripoli . The battle is for control of the Dehiba-Wazzin border crossing , which gives the rebels a road from the outside world into strongholds in the Western Mountains region . Although the rebels hold the border point , Gaddafi 's forces are in charge of a far bigger one to the north . On Saturday Dehiba 's schools were evacuated and residents scurried for safety as close to 100 mortars and missiles fell . The crackle of small arms fire as well as larger weapons could also be heard about 4 km -LRB- 2.5 miles -RRB- inside Libya , a Reuters witness on the border said . `` We are very afraid . The missiles are falling right around us , we do n't know what to do , '' said Tunisian Mohammed Naguez , a resident of Dehiba . `` Our children are afraid . The Tunisian authorities have to stop this . '' Most of the people in the Western Mountains belong to the Berber ethnic group and are distinct from other Libyans . They rose up two months ago and say towns such as Zintan and Yafran are under repeated bombardment from Gaddafi 's forces , running short of food , water and medicine . The civil war over Gaddafi 's rule has split the oil-producing desert state into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ill-disciplined but dedicated rebel forces . The revolt is the bloodiest yet against long-entrenched rulers across the Middle East and North Africa , which saw the overthrow of the veteran presidents of Tunisia and Egypt . -LRB- Reporting by Joseph Nasr in Berlin , Matt Robinson and Tarek Amara in Dehiba and Mariam Karouny in Beirut ; Writing by Matthew Bigg and Sonya Hepinstall ; Editing by Michael Roddy -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

There was no attempt tp commit `` crimes against humanity '' on the libya citizens , , before or after the UN intervention . We see in the latest attempt to prolong this intervention ; the us led contact group in italy , was set up tpo aid the rebels with arms and training , admitted to by the italian foreign minister and alluded to by the rebel spokesman in this news release . Time to leave the civil war to the Libyans . Whatever the reason for intervention = is not the concern of the U.S. . The security council of the UN was wrong for causing resolutions 1970 and 1973 and the international criminal court should zero in the irresponsible and illegal bombings and other like offensive actions by the nato coalition that corrupted the no fly zone rule .

But governments in the Sahel believe fighters of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- have received convoys of weapons including SA-7 missiles looted from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's abandoned arms caches . Targeting airliners would take training and moving al Qaeda cells nearer cities , so experts believe any heavy weapons are more likely to be used defensively in case of airborne attacks on the Islamist militants . However the remote and often volatile corners of countries such as Mauritania , Mali and Niger , where Islamists operate alongside rebels , local criminals and smugglers , are extremely vulnerable to the spillover effects of Libya 's conflict . `` The situation in Libya poses quite some problems for West African countries , '' said Kwesi Aning , a senior official at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center in Ghana . `` It is natural that some of the weapons would get into very bad hands ... There is no government control in the northern parts -LRB- of the Sahel fringing Libya -RRB- , '' Aning told Reuters . AQIM emerged out of the Algerian Salafist movement in 2007 and , under pressure from the Algerian army to the north , has become increasingly active in the Sahara region . The group , believed to number no more than a few hundred , has taken advantage of poor cross-border coordination to mount sporadic attacks on local armies and kidnap Westerners , earning some $ 50-70 million in ransoms so far , analysts say . A recent flurry of regional diplomacy has underscored pressing concerns over a spillover from Libya . Fears of a reprisal after the killing of Osama bin Laden are also high . The leaders of Mali and Chad believe looted weapons have reached AQIM bases in northern Mali , with Chad 's president warning they could become the best-equipped force in the region . An Algerian official spoke of several convoys . Others say there is no proof yet , though few think it would take much for AQIM , which is plugged into weapons smuggling networks and flush in cash from ransoms , to obtain them . `` There are enough floating around that it would be extremely easy for people keen to get hold of them to do so , '' said Peter Bouckaert , emergencies director at Human Rights Watch , who has spent weeks documenting the looted arsenals in Libya . Much of the focus has been on missing SA-7 shoulder-launched missiles , used by al Qaeda operatives who tried , but failed , to shoot down an Israeli charter plane in Kenya in 2002 . `` It is a top concern because this is one of the favorite weapons of al Qaeda groups , '' Bouckaert said , noting that militants in Iraq showed how stolen weapons could also be turned into bombs . Officials are acutely aware of the threat and fears of a `` spectacular '' attack in retaliation for the killing of bin Laden are real , but due to their short range , SA-7s would have to be moved by militants from remote desert bases to near airports by major cities if airliners were to be targeted , experts say . `` They are probably more useful as defensive weapons , '' said one diplomat who monitors the group 's activities . After mostly opportunistic kidnappings , attacks this year in Niamey and Nouakchott have proven AQIM 's ambition to hit capital cities . But another hurdle is the weapon itself , according to Nick Pratt , a terrorism expert at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies . `` It is not a weapon you just pick up and shoot ... The big issue is that it takes a long time to train , '' said Pratt , whose military experience included taking part in covert U.S. efforts to arm Mujahideen guerrillas in Afghanistan . `` Old Soviet-era -LRB- missiles -RRB- in the Sahara are less of a security concern than a truckload of AK 's -LRB- assault rifles -RRB- . '' It may not just be the weapons that flow south either . There are widespread reports of Gaddafi recruiting fighters , especially Tuareg nomads , to swell his ranks . Some of these new recruits , as well as fighters from the region who had long been in his ranks , will return home one day , officials say . Similar flows of experienced fighters back into marginalized parts of Mali and Niger were factors in rebellions during the 1990s . These countries ' governments are still struggling to heal wounds after the most recent uprisings between 2007 and 2009 . `` There is something of a historical pattern we do n't want to repeat , '' said Andre LeSage , Africa expert at the U.S-based National Defense University . Northern Mali , with its grinding poverty and isolation , is particularly susceptible . AQIM has turned it into a rear base , integrating into local tribes through marriage and seeking to drive a wedge between the government and local populations . Profitable smuggling networks also zigzag through the barren zone , undermining law and order and fuelling corruption . Mali President Amadou Toumani Toure last week sought out support among community leaders , warning them of the risks of the flow of weapons and fear of AQIM recruiting new fighters . `` We need community leaders to be on good terms with national governments so there is n't popular support for any movement ... so they do n't gain traction , '' LeSage said .

Russia , China and other powers have voiced dismay that the world body has appeared to take sides in an internal conflict , not just in Libya but also in Ivory Coast , where a Security Council resolution led to the ousting of an incumbent ruler . As a result , veto-holders Russia and China may not be as willing in future to permit sweeping endorsements for tough action , either by a coalition -- as in Libya -- or by U.N. peacekeepers -- as in Ivory Coast , diplomats say . No one contests the principle of protecting civilians during armed conflict , a theme that has been on the Security Council agenda for more than a decade . The skeptics ' concern is that it will be used as a cover by Western powers bent on overthrowing leaders they do not like . More generally , it raises the specter of `` interference in the internal affairs '' of sovereign states , a taboo for Moscow and Beijing for decades . In Libya , a March 17 Security Council resolution authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians as Tripoli looked set to crush rebels who had seized control of the east . Western air and missile strikes on the forces of leader Muammar Gaddafi drove them back from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . It was the first time the Council had authorized a military response to protect populations in a non-consenting state . In Ivory Coast , a similarly worded resolution passed on March 30 resulted in military action by French and U.N. peacekeepers that culminated 12 days later in the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo , who had refused to cede power after a presidential election the United Nations said he lost . As a consequence , Gbagbo 's challenger , Alassane Ouattara , took over the West African country . Following the two resolutions , human rights groups were ecstatic over what they saw as a new willingness by the United Nations to enforce principles to which it had long paid lip service . Russia and China , faced with an Arab League call for U.N. action on Libya and West African support over Ivory Coast , had abstained in the first resolution and voted for the second . But both soon made clear they thought the United Nations was at risk of overstepping its authority -- not protecting civilians but backing one faction in a civil conflict . At a Security Council debate this week , Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said it was `` unacceptable for U.N. peacekeepers ... to be drawn into armed conflict and essentially to take the side of one of the parties . '' Chinese Ambassador Li Baodong said , `` There must be no attempt at regime change or involvement in a civil war of a country by any party in the name of protecting civilians . '' Similar concerns have been expressed by Brazil , India and South Africa , which are also on the Security Council . The implications have not been lost on Western diplomats who had hoped the Council 's adoption of the Libya and Ivory Coast resolutions might set a precedent . `` There was a chance to create a model for the protection of civilians in Libya . But now it 's going to be very difficult in the future to persuade Russia and China to support such operations , '' a diplomat said . An immediate casualty could be a Western attempt to bring about Security Council action on Syria 's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters . `` Some people are cautious in the context of Libya , '' a diplomat commented . Protection of civilians is written into the mandate of at least seven U.N. peacekeeping forces around the world and has been the subject of regular reports by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor , Kofi Annan . These , however , have tended to focus on the soft end of the subject , such as programs to train peacekeepers , rather than the sharp end of NATO bombing a government army , as in Libya . The subject also has become enmeshed with an arcane debate at the United Nations over whether the world body has a `` responsibility to protect '' -- or R2P in U.N. jargon -- populations threatened by genocide or other mass atrocities . That concept was launched in a 2005 summit of more than 150 world leaders in a belated response to a perceived U.N. failure to prevent massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s . A carefully crafted declaration said the responsibility began with the government of the country concerned . If that failed , it foresaw a sliding scale of international action ranging from advice through mediation to -- in a last resort -- intervention by force authorized by the Security Council . A General Assembly conference two years ago showed that most U.N. members broadly supported R2P , but envoys from leftist states in Latin America and elsewhere denounced it as a smokescreen for `` colonialism and interventionism '' by the West . Some diplomats say that if the Libyan insurrection had toppled Gaddafi in a couple of weeks , rather than extending into a drawn-out civil war , concerns about how protection of civilians was to be interpreted would have been far fewer . Supporters of R2P say that was never likely to happen and it was too soon to say the concept was fatally damaged . But Ramesh Thakur of the Australian National University said , `` The evolution of R2P , and prospects of its being authorized\\/used again , will depend on how Libya turns out . If NATO respects its limitations and success is achieved , R2P stands vindicated . If -LRB- resolution -RRB- 1973 -LRB- on Libya -RRB- is abused and a messy stalemate ensues , the bar will be greatly raised .

ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo had said earlier this month he would seek three arrest warrants for the `` pre-determined '' killing of protesters in Libya following U.N. Security Council referral of the violence to the Hague-based court in February . It had been widely expected that Moreno-Ocampo would seek an arrest warrant for Libyan leader Gaddafi , but in addition to a warrant for his son Saif , the prosecutor said he would also seek the arrest of Libya 's head of espionage , Abdullah al-Senussi . `` The office gathered direct evidence about orders issued by Muammar Gaddafi himself , direct evidence of Saif al-Islam organizing the recruitment of mercenaries and direct evidence of the participation of al-Senussi in the attacks against demonstrators , '' Moreno-Ocampo said at the ICC . He added the office of the prosecutor also documented how the three held meetings `` to plan the operations '' and Gaddafi used his `` absolute authority to commit crimes in Libya '' . The ICC prosecutor has moved with unprecedented swiftness in his investigation , with the request for arrest warrants coming just two and a half months after it the Security Council referral . Moreno-Ocampo said the swiftness of his investigation stems from global consensus that the crimes committed in Libya had to be investigated , although judges will now need to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to issue warrants .

Libyan rebels also said they had information that Shokri Ghanem , 68 , had defected , a move that if confirmed would deal a major blow to Gaddafi 's efforts to shore up his 41-year rule . `` He is in a hotel with a group of other Libyan officials , '' the Tunisian source told Reuters , saying Ghanem had been staying in the south of the country . Another Tunisian security source said he was on his way to the capital Tunis . A government official in Tripoli said there was no sign Ghanem had defected . Three months into the unrest , rebels hold Benghazi and the oil-producing east of Libya , helped by a NATO bombing campaign sanctioned at the United Nations to protect civilians . But the military victory rebels once sought seems a distant prospect and many pin their hopes on a collapse of central power in Tripoli driven by disaffection and defections . Ghanem , an internationally respected technocrat , is credited with liberalizing Libya 's economy and energy sector . Rebel finance and oil minister Ali Tarhouni told Reuters on a visit to Doha that he understood Ghanem had left his post , and said he hoped to represent Libya at an OPEC meeting in June . Libya is estimated to have lost two thirds of its oil output since the unrest began three months ago . Rebels and Arab media reported on a previous occasion that the U.S.-educated Ghanem had stepped down but he appeared later and said he was in his office and working as usual . The most prominent Libyan defector so far is Moussa Koussa , the former foreign minister , who fled to Britain earlier this year . Libyan state television said Libyan forces had hit a NATO warship that was shelling areas of the rebel-held city of Misrata , but NATO denied the report , saying it was `` totally fabricated . '' A doctor in the western city said at least seven people were killed during fighting between rebels and government forces earlier in the day . Most of the dead were believed to be rebels . British aircraft and navy ships attacked a training base for bodyguards for Gaddafi 's inner circle and intelligence buildings in the capital , the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday . In central Tripoli , NATO airstrikes hit two buildings including one a Libyan spokesman said contained files detailing corruption cases against government officials who have defected . Officials summoned reporters after the attack in the early hours to visit the two damaged buildings , which they said housed security forces and Libya 's anti-corruption agency . One building was in flames . Thousands have been killed in the Libyan conflict , the bloodiest revolt of what has been called the `` Arab Spring '' of protests that has removed autocratic leaders in Tunis and Cairo . Libyan rebels briefly pulled back from the Dehiba-Wazin border post on the frontier with southern Tunisia on Tuesday . Five were killed and several wounded by Libyan government shellfire , they said . At least four Russian-made Grad rockets fired from Libya landed inside Tunisia during the clashes . The crossing is on a supply route for rebels in Libya 's Western Mountains and is an exit point for injured fighters . Tunisia said it would refer Tripoli to the U.N. Security Council if Libya fired across the border again . Russia hosted a representative of Gaddafi 's government in Moscow on Tuesday and called on Tripoli to stop using force against civilians , comply fully with U.N. Security Council resolutions and withdraw armed groups from cities . `` The answer we heard can not be called negative , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters . He suggested Gaddafi 's government was making such steps conditional on NATO and rebels calling a halt to the use of force . Libya was ready to look at peace proposals based on those suggested by the African Union and to comply with Security Council resolutions , he said . `` The only things that our interlocutors from Tripoli noted today was the necessity of the insurgents accepting analogous steps and that NATO also stop bombing , '' Lavrov said , adding that it remained to agree terms and a timeframe for a truce . Both the rebels and Western nations have rejected past ceasefire proposals , saying the only deal they would accept was one under which Gaddafi relinquished power . The proposal set out by the Russian foreign minister made no mention of that .

Arabic television stations quoted Tunisian officials as denying that the family members were in the country , saying that Safia Gaddafi and her daughter Aisha were on a U.N. sanctions list and would therefore not be allowed in . However , the security source said the two women came to Tunisia with a Libyan delegation on May 14 and have been staying on the southern island of Djerba near the Libyan border . It did not appear that they were traveling with Shokri Ghanem , Libya 's top oil official , who is believed to have also crossed into Tunisia several days ago and defected . Government officials in Tripoli were not immediately available for comment . The Tunisian Interior Ministry denied that any members of the Gaddafi family were in the country in remarks to Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya TV . Al Jazeera quoted a ministry spokesman as saying Tunisia would arrest any members of the Gaddafi family should they enter the country under a U.N.-imposed travel ban . A Libyan opposition source said the women were in Djerba to accompany Aisha 's husband , who he said had been injured in the Libyan conflict , and was seeking treatment in Tunisia . A commentator on a daily political talkshow on state-run Libyan TV dismissed reports Gaddafi and members of his family had left Libya as `` rumors '' and `` psychological war '' spread by rebels and the West . `` Those people -LRB- Gaddafi and his children -RRB- live among other people and if any of those rumors were true it would be possible to find this out , '' the commentator said . Italian officials have speculated that Gaddafi , who has been in power for four decades , was wounded during a NATO air strike in the capital last month which killed his youngest son and three of his grandchildren . Libyan television has shown footage of the leader since the bombardment and aired an audio message in which he taunted NATO forces , saying he was in a place where their artillery could not reach him . Since the revolt began in February against Gaddafi 's rule , Aisha Gaddafi has made several public appearances backing her father , and attacking the rebels and Western powers trying to overthrow him . A month ago she appeared at her father 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound in Tripoli and addressed cheering crowds of supporters in an event broadcast live on Libyan state television . `` Talk about Gaddafi stepping down is an insult to all Libyans because Gaddafi is not in Libya , but in the hearts of all Libyans , '' she said . On Tuesday , Libyan rebels and a Tunisian security source said the head of Libya 's National Oil Corporation , Shokri Ghanem , had defected and fled to Tunisia . If confirmed , the defection would undermine Gaddafi 's efforts to cling to power . Ghanem would be the most senior Libyan official to defect since former foreign minister Moussa Koussa switched sides in Britain earlier this year after passing through Tunisia . -LRB- Reporting by Joseph Nasr in Berlin , Christian Lowe in Algiers and William Maclean in London , Writing by Sylvia Westall ; editing by David Stamp -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Another EU diplomat said `` a number of EU states '' believed it would be a sensible next step , and it was possible it would be discussed by foreign ministers who meet in Brussels on Monday , although it was not formally on the agenda . Gaddafi 's government is seeking to raise fuel imports by using a loophole in international sanctions after two months of western air strikes against Libya .

'' The discussions will likely take place at the level of the EU sanctions committee next week and could become law by early June if it is successful , he added . A third EU diplomat said there was `` relatively strong '' backing for the idea , which was proposed by Britain , but political agreement would be needed from all 27 EU states and it could therefore take more time . The discussions may also involve the Libyan state-owned shipping company General National Maritime Transport Company -LRB- GNMTC -RRB- which is not on the sanctions list and has managed to bring at least one fuel cargo into west Libya . EU , U.N. and U.S. sanctions against Libya are implemented through a list of companies that are excluded from business , but exports to western Libya or dealings with firms missing from the list are not forbidden . Prime Minister David Cameron said earlier this month Britain sees scope for tightening sanctions on oil and oil products against Gaddafi . Reuters revealed in April that Libya had received at least one shipment via a ship-to-ship transfer in Tunisia and on Wednesday reported that west Libya is expected to receive a fuel cargo that recently visited Turkish and Georgian ports . Both states deny a role in the transaction . The idea to target ports follows a similar EU decision in the Ivory Coast in January to pressure the incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo of the cocoa producer to quit after an election he was widely seen to have lost . `` The international community tried to sanction ports for the first time earlier this year during the conflict in Ivory Coast and it worked , '' one of the sources said . Susannah Cogman , partner in the corporate crime and investigations team of law firm Herbert Smith , saw the proposal as a move towards increasingly targeted sanctions . `` This is novel in that it 's using financial sanctions to address specific geographical trade issues . That 's unusual , '' she said . But she added that these sanctions would be limited to acts , individuals and companies within the EU . -LRB- Reporting by Emma Farge and Dmitry Zhdannikov ; additional reporting by Julien Toyer and David Brunnstrom , Editing by Jason Neely -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "164", "dct": "2011-05-25", "dates": ["2011-05-25", "2011-05-25", "2011-05-25", "2011-05-24", "2011-03-19", "2011-05-29", "2011-04-01"], "text": "JOHANNESBURG | Wed May 25 , 2011 7:26 am BST JOHANNESBURG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - South African President Jacob Zuma plans to visit Tripoli next week to discuss an exit strategy for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in cooperation with the Turkish government , Talk Radio 702 reported on Wednesday .

San Antonio-based Tesoro told Reuters on Wednesday it bought the Libyan rebel crude to process in its Hawaii refinery . The deal was first agreed upon in late April , company spokesman Mike Marcy said . `` We purchased a cargo of Libyan crude that was available at the time , '' he said in an email . Swiss oil trading firm Vitol SA , which loaded the crude onto a tanker in Libya in early April , acted as middleman in the transaction , trading sources said . While Vitol marketed the crude , Tesoro 's purchase of the cargo marks the first transaction involving Libya 's eastern rebels -- fighting with NATO 's backing to topple Muammar Gaddafi -- and a major foreign commercial user of oil . `` It 's an important precedent because it proves the rebels can find international buyers for their oil , '' a source at a major oil tanker operator told Reuters , requesting anonymity . That could help pave the way for more Libyan oil sales . Rebels , who need funds to continue their fight against Gaddafi , want to sell more oil from the chunk of Libyan territory they control . But due to the country 's civil war , Libyan oilfield production has fallen to a small fraction of its normal 1.6 million barrels per day . Potential buyers of eastern Libyan crude have also worried that international sanctions against doing business with Libyan firms make any transaction risky , traders and shippers said . The Liberian-flagged tanker , called Equator , is laden with a million barrels of light Libyan crude worth around $ 100 million , and is scheduled to arrive in Honolulu around June 7 , according to Reuters tanker tracking data . Tesoro told Reuters that the Libyan crude cargo is not subject to sanctions . `` This purchase was made in strict accordance with the relevant White House Executive Order , signed by President Obama , '' Marcy wrote in an email . In late February , the U.S. government pronounced it legal to do business with the rebel-controlled oil firm Agoco , which usually produces around 400,000 barrels a day . The firm had been part of the Gaddafi-controlled National Oil Corp until it fell under rebel control . The tanker cargo had been floating idle near Singapore since late April , GPS data shows . The Tesoro deal lays to rest a mystery that has surrounded its eventual destination and buyer , which have been subject to speculation among shipbrokers and oil traders . `` There has been a lot of secrecy , '' a U.S.-based oil trader said . `` Everyone wanted to know where the cargo was headed , but it was hard to track . '' Vitol declined to comment on why the cargo was delayed , and did not reveal its buyer . While the U.S. government executive order exempts rebel crude cargoes from sanctions , the United Nations and the European Union have also placed sanctions on Libya , and some legal experts say that buying oil from eastern Libyan may still entail risks . Reuters wrote a special report about the Libyan crude cargo on May 16 . At that time , several sources said it appeared the cargo was in legal limbo , with oil companies weighing the potential risks of buying it . -LRB- Emma Farge contributed reporting from London ; Editing by David Gregorio and Lisa Shumaker -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "340", "dct": "2011-05-30", "dates": ["2011-05-30"], "text": "As the civil war in Libya carries on ... people living in the rebel held Western Mountains resolve to stand strong against Muammar Gaddafi .

In Libya 's rebel-held east , there is a conspicuous lack of the deep and fractious animosities that fuelled internal conflicts in Iraq , Northern Ireland , Rwanda , Libya 's neighbor Algeria and elsewhere . Almost all invective is aimed at just one man : Gaddafi . `` Who do I hate ? I do n't want Libyan soldiers prosecuted . You 're a soldier and you have to follow orders , '' said Farisi , whose brother Fathi was killed in February at the beginning of the uprising against Gaddafi 's absolute rule . In east Libya at least , evidence of the brutality that has marked most recent civil conflicts -- in particular dumped bodies bearing signs of torture and mutilation -- is hard to find . One reason cited by people in Benghazi , the rebel capital , is Libya 's homogeneity . Virtually all Libyans are Arab Sunni Muslims , unlike Iraq , for example , where in the years following the 2003 U.S. invasion , extreme violence fed on divisions between Sunnis , Shi'ites , Kurds and Christians . The main fault lines seen in Libyan society are tribal . Gaddafi has manipulated the country 's tribal structures through patronage of some tribes and intimidation of others , to consolidate power . Some analysts see tribal strife further destabilising Libya should Gaddafi fall . The Libyan leader still controls much of the country 's west and the capital Tripoli , despite increasing pressure from NATO airstrikes . The rebels however have been keen to disavow tribalism , and Farisi did not want tribal violence in his brother 's name . `` If we tried all Gaddafi 's soldiers , there would be real civil war . Each man has a tribe behind him ... There has to be reconciliation , '' he said . It is difficult to tell how widespread Farisi 's views are , but his conciliatory tone is echoed by many others in the east including the rebel leadership , whose National Transitional Council on Saturday offered an amnesty to Gaddafi supporters who defect . In Benghazi , the bodies of dead Gaddafi soldiers and those of rebels that fought against them are buried in the same cemetery . They are washed according to Islamic ritual and prayers are said for all , cemetery and morgue workers said . `` We do n't have the custom of ` These are Gaddafi 's people , throw them over there ' . They 're all martyrs , and they 're buried together with our martyrs , '' said grave digger Ghaith Hussein . `` These people were just following orders ... Our problem is with the one who gave the orders , '' he added . Hussein and others said those who fought the rebels may have been forced to do so , or could have been fooled by Gaddafi 's propaganda . The Libyan leader 's autocratic rule has been brutal , and deserters risk the death penalty . On state TV , he has labeled the rebels rats and drug-addled followers of al Qaeda . At Benghazi 's courthouse , lawyer Breika Bitamar says she will volunteer to defend captured Gaddafi loyalists for free . `` Some of them may genuinely believe the rebels are al Qaeda , or that they are fighting a crusader from abroad in the form of NATO , '' she said . `` Some of these men think they are fighting for Libya , and anyone who dies fighting for Libya is a martyr , '' she added . However , the magnanimity towards Libyan Gaddafi loyalists felt by some in the rebel-held east rarely extends to African mercenaries , who the rebels say Gaddafi has hired to quell the revolt against his four-decade rule . After battles , rebels often display identity cards taken from the bodies of people from Chad , Niger , Mali , Mauritania and other African states . Rebels who blame the actions of Gaddafi 's Libyan troops on a misunderstanding are less indulgent with the mercenaries . But morgue worker Haroun Salem , who has handled the bodies of men accused of being mercenaries , bears them no ill will , and has washed their bodies and prayed for them at the cemetery . `` Sometimes we find counterfeit or out of date money in their pockets , '' he said . `` Gaddafi has tricked them , just like he tricked us for 41 years .

TRIPOLI | Fri Jun 3 , 2011 4:48 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China made its first confirmed contact with Libyan rebels in the latest diplomatic setback for Muammar Gaddafi , and France said on Friday it was working with those close to the veteran ruler to persuade him to leave power . The meeting in Qatar between a Chinese diplomat and the leader of the rebel National Transitional Council follows a spate of defections by high profile figures this week , including top oil official and former prime minister Shokri Ghanem . Libyan rebels and NATO have made Gaddafi 's departure a condition for agreeing a ceasefire in a conflict that has killed thousands , but he emphatically told visiting South African President Jacob Zuma this week he would not leave Libya . A NATO-led military alliance extended its mission to protect civilians in Libya for a further 90 days this week , and France said it was stepping up military pressure as well as working with those close to Gaddafi to try to persuade him to quit . `` He is more and more isolated , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told Europe 1 radio . `` There have been more defections around him and we have received messages from his close entourage which has understood that he must leave power . '' In Beijing , a terse Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said Beijing 's ambassador to Qatar , Zhang Zhiliang , had met and `` exchanged views on developments in Libya '' with Mustafa Abdel Jalil , the chairman of the rebel council that is trying to offer itself as a credible temporary alterative to Gaddafi . The ministry gave no details of the talks but the meeting itself was an indication that Beijing wants to keep open lines of communication with the rebel forces . China was among the emerging powers that abstained in March when the United Nations Security Council voted to authorize NATO-led air strikes . China was never especially close to Gaddafi , but it generally tries to avoid taking firm sides in other countries ' domestic conflicts , including in the Middle East , where it has been buying growing quantities of oil . In Tripoli , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said he had no immediate comment on China 's meeting with the rebels . CLASHES REPORTED IN WESTERN MOUNTAINS Now in its fourth month , the Libyan conflict is deadlocked , with rebels unable to break out of their strongholds and advance toward Tripoli , where Gaddafi appears to be entrenched . Rebels control the east of Libya around Benghazi , where the rebel council is based , and a mountain range stretching from the town of Zintan , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , toward the western border with Tunisia . In London , Major General John Lorimer said British warplanes destroyed two tanks and two armored personnel carriers on Thursday in Yafran , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- southwest of Tripoli , where he said Gaddafi 's forces were continuing to attack rebels . A rebel spokesman in the Western Mountains town of Nalut , Kalefa Ali , said rebels had been fighting forces loyal to Gaddafi in Trumeet to the south of Yafran and in Bir Ayyad . The rebels took over Bir Ayyad , a road junction which controls access to Yafran from the north , and replaced the green Libyan flags there with the red , black and green rebel flag , a Reuters cameraman said . `` Bir Ayyad is under rebel control , '' a rebel called Mohammed told Reuters by telephone . He said no rebel fighters were wounded in the fighting . In Misrata , rebel leader Abdelsalam reported fighting in Dafniyah to the west of the city . `` It started at 10 am and Gaddafi 's forces have been shelling Dafniyah since then , using mortars and heavier rockets , '' he said . He said revolutionaries in Zlitan had been supplied with weapons and telecommunications equipment from Misrata and Benghazi , and had been waging attacks at night , `` but not on the scale that threatens Gaddafi 's forces ' iron grip on Zlitan . '' Zlitan is the next town to the west of Misrata , and one of only three between there and Tripoli . Libyan television reported on Friday that forces of the `` crusader coalition '' had shelled civilian and military targets in Al Jufrah , 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli . BODIES OF AFRICAN REFUGEES FOUND In Tunisia , a U.N. official said the bodies of 150 African refugees fleeing turmoil in Libya had been recovered off the Tunisian coast after the vessels carrying them illegally to Europe got into difficulty . Tunisian authorities rescued 570 people , but many others went into the water when a stampede to get off the small fishing boats -- combined with the effect of rough seas -- capsized some of the vessels , a Tunisian official said . In all about 250 people were reported on Thursday as missing from the vessels . The United Nations has warned government-held parts of Libya were running out of food and the capital Tripoli this week saw the first big protest in months against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . Gaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants , and has called the NATO intervention an act of colonial aggression designed to grab Libya 's plentiful oil . Western governments say they believe they are wearing down Gaddafi 's ability to control Libya through a combination of diplomatic pressure and military action , although the U.S. role in the conflict in particular has been controversial at home . The House of Representatives prepared to vote on differing approaches to U.S. involvement in Libya , one directing President Barack Obama to pull U.S. forces out of NATO operations and a second that demands more information about U.S. strategy . The resolutions are a response from U.S. lawmakers in both main parties who are unhappy the United States is now in a third conflict after Iraq and Afghanistan .

Russia sees its task as building a bridge between these two banks on which Libyan society now stands , '' said Mikhail Margelov , President Dmitry Medvedev 's special envoy to Africa . At a G8 summit last month , Medvedev joined Western partners in urging Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down , offered Russia 's services as a mediator and said he was sending Margelov to Libya , initially to Benghazi . Analysts say Russia wants to preserve its influence in a country where it had billions of dollars in arms , energy and railroad deals . `` Russia has a unique situation in Libya now : We did not sever relations with Tripoli , we have established relations with Benghazi , '' Margelov told Russia 's state-run Rossiya-24 television upon arrival in Benghazi . `` We are ready , if it 's possible , to act as middlemen in establishing an internal Libyan political dialogue . Russia is ready to help politically , economically and in any possible way , '' Margelov told a media conference in Benghazi . `` We ... believe that Gaddafi has lost his legitimacy after the first bullet shot against the Libyan people , '' he said , adding democracy in Libya would be achieved through elections that would take place after the civil war ends . Medvedev had said he hoped Margelov would have the opportunity to speak with both sides , but that he did not travel to Tripoli on this visit . He left for Cairo after his talks , Russian media reported . Margelov met Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebel national council , Russian media said . He was also to have met Ali Tarhouni , the rebel minister of oil and finance , to discuss the financial situation and more effective aid . Russia supported an initial U.N. Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Gaddafi 's government but abstained in the March vote on a second resolution that authorised military intervention . It has accused the Western coalition conducting air strikes of going beyond its mandate to protect civilians . Rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's four-decade rule control the east of Libya from their stronghold in Benghazi , the western city of Misrata and the mountains near the border with Tunisia . They have been unable to advance on Tripoli against Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces . The Libyan capital and vicinity has come under increased attack from NATO bombing in recent days . In Oslo , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow is not seeking the leading role in Libyan mediation and emphasised the importance of African Union efforts .

The United States is holding more than $ 34 billion as part of sanctions imposed in late February against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his top officials . Under the measure , none of the assets could be used to buy weapons or military equipment . Some U.S. lawmakers have been wary of directly arming Libyan rebels seeking to overthrow Gaddafi . Obama administration officials have said they were looking into whether some of the frozen cash , securities and other financial instruments could be used to aid the Libyan rebel effort . Other backers of the bill are Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry , Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin and the panel 's top Republican John McCain , and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman , an Independent . Bipartisan agreement on the measure written in consultation with the administration gives it a better chance of quick passage . But the measure would still have to clear the U.S. House of Representatives . Sponsors of bill said the war in Libya has nearly brought its economy to a halt and has precipitated a humanitarian crisis with food and medical supplies running dangerously low in some areas . Rebel groups and forces loyal to the Libyan leader have been fighting in a civil war ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies . -LRB- Reporting by JoAnne Allen ; editing by Vicki Allen -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "156", "dct": "2011-06-09", "dates": ["2011-06-09", "2011-06-09", "2011-04-01"], "text": "Up to 15,000 killed in Libya war : U.N. rights expert GENEVA | Thu Jun 9 , 2011 12:59 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people have been killed on both sides in four months of fighting in Libya , according to Cherif Bassiouni , who led a U.N.

Full Article Gaddafi forces advance on Libya 's Misrata MISRATA | Thu Jun 9 , 2011 1:00 am IST MISRATA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Thousands of troops loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi advanced on the rebel-held western city of Misrata on Wednesday , shelling it from three sides in attacks that killed at least 12 rebels , a rebel spokesman said . The offensive followed a lull in NATO bombing of Tripoli on Wednesday , after 24 hours of some of the heaviest bombardments of the Libyan capital since air strikes began in March . NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday , but there were few signs of willingness to intensify their Libya mission , which has so far failed to oust Gaddafi as leader of this oil-producing North African desert state . The alliance says the bombing aims to protect civilians from the Libyan leader 's military , which crushed popular protests against his rule in February , leaving many dead . The conflict has now become a civil war . `` Misrata is under heavy shelling ... Gaddafi forces are shelling Misrata from three sides : east , west and south , '' rebel spokesman Hassan al-Misrati told Reuters from inside the besieged town . `` He has sent thousands of troops from all sides and they are trying to enter the city . They are still outside , though . '' Doctors at the Hekmah hospital in central Misrata told Reuters correspondents who visited it that at least 11 people had been killed and 35 wounded , many seriously . There was no immediate comment from Gaddafi 's government . A rebel fighter , who declined to be named , vowed revenge . `` One day soon , God willing , we will be at Bab al-Aziziya -LRB- Gaddafi 's compound -RRB- and we will find Gaddafi and his military forces and we will kill him , '' he told Reuters . With officials like British Foreign Secretary William Hague talking explicitly of Gaddafi being forced out , critics say NATO has gone beyond its U.N. mandate to protect civilians . Western powers are lining up behind the rebels . Spain 's Foreign Minister on a visit to the eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday said his country now only recognized their National Transitional Council as the representative of the Libyan people . Rebel spokesman Kalefa Ali in the Western mountain town of Nalut said the towns of Yafran and Kalaa , which fell to rebels earlier this week , had been shelled by Gaddafi forces . `` Rebels fear that Gaddafi 's forces will launch a wide scale offensive in the western mountains as he is doing in Misrata today , '' said Ali . `` He is putting on a fight and not giving up . '' Juma Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman in Zintan , said Gaddafi 's forces were holding residents in the world heritage-listed old city of Gadamis , some 600 kilometres southwest of the capital on the Tunisia and Algerian border , after anti-government protests . Accounts from the mountains and Gadamis could not be independently verified because access for reporters is limited . Gaddafi troops and the rebels have been deadlocked for weeks , with neither side able to hold territory on a road between Ajdabiyah in the east , which Gaddafi forces shelled on Monday , and the Gaddafi-held oil town of Brega further west . Rebels control the east of Libya , the western city of Misrata and the range of western mountains near the border with Tunisia . They have been unable to advance on the capital against Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces . NATO sought broader support for the Western bombing campaign in Libya on Wednesday , given that the alliance 's air power has been stretched by the latest strikes on Tripoli . `` We want to see increased urgency in some quarters in terms of Libya , '' British Defense Minister Liam Fox told reporters in Brussels . But some NATO allies that have not taken part in the bombing said they would not alter their stance , and Sweden , a non-NATO participant , said it would scale down its role . Of the 28 NATO allies , only eight , led by Britain and France , have been conducting air strikes on Gaddafi 's forces , and a senior U.S. official warned this week that fatigue was beginning to set in among the aircrews already committed . NATO allies agree Gaddafi must go , but not all view military intervention as the best way to achieve this . Germany , which opposed the Libyan intervention , said it understood the pressures on Britain and France but would not change its position . Spain said it would not join the mission , despite now recognizing the rebels as Libya 's representatives . As bombs fell on Tuesday , Gaddafi vowed to fight to the end . `` We only have one choice : we will stay in our land dead or alive , '' he said in a fiery audio address on state television . Gaddafi says the rebels are a minority of Islamist militants and the NATO campaign is an attempt to grab Libya 's oil . Admiral Mike Mullen , outgoing chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , at a round table event for journalists in Cairo said on Wednesday that Gaddafi must quit . Asked if NATO could end operations with Gaddafi still in power , Mullen said : `` It is the United States ' position that Gaddafi has to leave . I think it has been a challenge for anybody to put a timetable on that . I certainly would n't do that today . What I have seen is what I would call very slow progress . More and more individuals from his regime are defecting , some of whom are in the military . '' Libya 's labor minister al Amin Manfur became the latest to defect from Gaddafi 's government and was reported as saying The Libyan government was selling oil on the black market . Attention is also turning to diplomatic overtures ahead of a meeting of the Libya contact group of Western and Arab foreign ministers in the UAE on Thursday . Ministers will try to fine tune a post-Gaddafi political transition plan with the rebels . China 's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told his visiting Libyan counterpart on Wednesday that the most pressing task facing Libya was to secure an immediate ceasefire .

BENGHAZI , Libya | Thu Jun 9 , 2011 7:16 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - To get an idea of who might wield influence in post-civil war Libya , take a look at the flags flying in the rebel-held east of the country . Outside the courthouse in Benghazi -- rebel headquarters and symbolic heart of the uprising against the 41-year rule of leader Muammar Gaddafi -- fly the flags of France , Great Britain , the United States , the European Union , NATO . There 's one other flag , too : Qatar 's . `` Qatar , really , it 's time to convey our gratitude to them , '' Abdulla Shamia , rebel economy chief , told Reuters . `` They really helped us a lot . It 's a channel for transportation , for help , for everything . '' It has a population of just 1.7 million people , but the wealthy Gulf monarchy has long sought a major voice in political affairs in the region . It has brokered peace talks in Sudan and Lebanon , owns the influential pan-Arab news network Al Jazeera , and recently won the right to host the 2022 soccer World Cup . Now the gas-rich nation has placed a big geopolitical bet in Libya , splashing out hundreds of millions of dollars on fuel , food and cash transfers for the rebels . A representative from the Emir 's palace declined to comment on what products Qatar has delivered to Libya , and on the ruling family 's motivations behind its Libyan engagement . It 's certainly a gamble . If the rebels win , Qatar is likely to pick up energy deals and new influence in North Africa . But if they lose , Qatar 's ambitions may further alienate it among its neighbors . `` I guess ever since the late 1990s , Qatar has been trying to break the Saudi-dominated status quo and carve out a niche position , '' said Saket Vemprala from the London-based Business Monitor International consultancy . `` At the moment I think it 's more geopolitical , they want to broaden their -LRB- influence in the -RRB- region and become a more significant player ... And it certainly makes it easy for them to portray themselves as being on the right side of history , '' he said . That sentiment is on display on a huge billboard in front of the courthouse . Over a picture of Qatari ruler Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani reads the promise : `` Qatar , history will always remember your support for our cause . '' Being on the right side of history does n't come cheap . Qatar was the first Arab country to contribute planes to police the U.N.-backed no-fly zone over Libya . Simultaneously , hundreds of millions of dollars began to flow from the Qatari capital Doha to Benghazi from early March . While international oil traders pondered whether to brave the bombs and international sanctions to start buying oil from the rebels , Qatar was quick to throw a lifeline and help eastern Libya meet its most pressing needs including fuel , food , medicines and telecommunications equipment . Qatar 's foreign ministry has confirmed that it has shipped four tankers full of gasoline , diesel and other refined fuels to Benghazi , which specialists estimate is enough to feed the large Benghazi power plant for one or two weeks . But people on the ground in Benghazi say they believe Qatar is behind much of the continuing delivery of fuel supplies , as well as food , medicine and cash payments . Given that oil production in the east has stalled and the economy generates no cash , they ask , where else are all the supplies coming from ? Overall , the Qatari shipments have covered 100 percent of eastern Libya energy needs for a month and a half , Salah Fouad , a rebel oil engineer based in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk , said in May . `` We are receiving a huge help from Qatar . Its role in unforgettable . Even the little child knows Qatar 's role and assistance to us , '' he said . A western consultant who worked in Benghazi in March and April supported this view . `` You ask port workers how are they doing today and they say , ` Oh , we are fine . We just received aid from Qatar , ' '' he said , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of his mission . `` You ask the council what 's the situation with diesel and they say , ` Oh we are just fine , we 've got new deliveries from Qatar . ' You tell Libyan officials to let you know if something goes wrong with power facilities and they tell you , ` Oh we are just fine , Qatar is helping us . ' '' A Gulf-based oil trader with knowledge of Qatari gasoline deliveries estimated monthly requirements at 10 gasoline and 5-6 diesel cargoes a month to help run vehicles and Benghazi 's huge power plant . As shipments are being settled on a government-to-government basis , they are usually not followed by satellite tracking systems , which monitor mostly commercial shipments . Those commercial shipments have included a test-case export cargo from the rebel-held east , shipped out in early May by trading house Vitol . Some traders say Qatar has gone further . `` Everyone gets excited about one Vitol cargo and does n't see a fleet of Qatari tankers , '' said another London-based trader . Other countries are helping the rebels as well , of course . An anti-Gaddafi coalition called the Libya contact group , including the United States , France , Britain and Italy -- as well as Kuwait and Jordan -- agreed in May to set up a fund to help them ; Washington pledged to unlock some of the $ 30 billion -LRB- 18.3 billion pounds -RRB- of Libyan state funds frozen in the United States . What makes Qatar different is the breadth and depth of its aid . Rebel officials in Doha say Qatari banks are helping facilitate international money transfers in rebel-held areas to recapitalise the paralysed banking system , though they wo n't say which banks . Qatar is also believed by diplomatic sources in Doha to have granted some Libyans working for Qatari companies leave of absence so they can contribute to the war effort . Several western and Doha-based diplomatic sources say Qatar is even supplying the rebels arms , including possibly Milan anti-tank missiles . The Gulf state declined to comment on whether it has supplied the rebels with arms , or in what quantity . In May , the rebels estimated they urgently needed $ 2-3 billion in cash . When the anti-Gaddafi coalition set up its fund , Qatar immediately pledged the largest sum of $ 400 - $ 500 million . What 's behind Qatar 's generosity ? It helps that it is so rich . Qatar 's copious gas reserves have made it one of the world 's wealthiest countries , with a sky-high gross domestic product per person of $ 88,000 according to the International Monetary Fund . Its $ 60-billion plus sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in banks Credit Suisse and Barclays , as well as London 's iconic department store Harrods . `` Qatar will soon -- literally -- have more money than it knows what to do with , '' according to a 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable , obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by Reuters . The largesse in Libya is part investment , part strategic . `` They are looking to park investments around the world . They helped the Lebanon peace process , Yemen , they got the World Cup , Doha talks , Al Jazeera -- these are all parts of a very big diplomatic game and a fight for influence , '' says a London-based British diplomat . The big prize is energy . Libya produced 1.6 million barrels of oil per day before the war , or almost 2 percent of world output , and has enough reserves to sustain that level of production for 77 years , according to BP . Qatar would like to control a chunk of that oil supply as well as potentially large Libyan gas exports to Europe which otherwise would effectively rival Qatar 's own deliveries . Although gas markets have faced a severe glut in the past few years , the outlook is improving fast , especially in the aftermath of Japan 's Fukushima disaster and the decision by Germany to phase out nuclear power . `` Qatar is putting energy at the forefront of its diplomacy . Libya brings them closer to Europe and to their future markets . They will be right on the Mediterranean , '' said the British diplomat . With direct access to Europe , Qatar would be in a position to carve up the gas markets between itself and Russia , with which Doha enjoys increasingly friendly ties . There 's also Libya 's sovereign wealth fund -LRB- LIA -RRB- , which has some $ 70 billion worth of assets frozen around the world . The LIA owns stakes in Italian bank UniCredit , defense company Finmeccanica , British publisher Pearson which owns the Financial Times , and Belgian financial group Fortis , now known as Ageas . If the rebels win , Qatar would have a say in what the LIA does with its investments . `` Libya is not Iraq . You are unlikely to have a protracted civil war once it is over , '' said the western risk consultant who worked in Benghazi . `` So those investments are not like putting money at the bottom of a pit . It should pay back and also possibly give Qatar influence on what the LIA can invest money in . If we use takeover terminology , Qatar is exploring unrealised value . '' The Qataris see such rich pickings they have recently turned down opportunities elsewhere , according to a source close to the Qatar Investment Authority -LRB- QIA -RRB- , the country 's sovereign wealth fund . `` Qatar 's leaders are intensely focussed on sorting out the crisis in Libya , to the extent that they have passed on a few items over the past few months . '' A popular joke in Benghazi illustrates Qatari ambitions in Libya perfectly . What 's the new nickname of Qatari ruler Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani ? The Emir of Qatar and Libya . So why is an absolute monarchy , with little time for democracy at home , mixed up with a democratic rebellion ? Qatar 's foreign ministry has cited the U.N. resolution and the emir 's desire to alleviate the suffering of the Libyan people . `` The reasons as laid out as to why Qatar is acting do not quite seem to account for the huge risks and extraordinarily bold actions that Qatar is taking , '' said David Roberts , deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute based in Doha . `` I can only account for this apparent discrepancy by suggesting that this policy is being heavily pushed by Qatar 's elite . '' Rumours abound in Doha that the real reason for Qatar 's interest in Libya is that al-Thani 's wife Sheikha Mozah has close personal ties there , although her representatives declined to comment . `` Most of Qatar 's leadership , the al-Thanis and the sheikhs , know Libya very well , because they went to school with Libyans in the U.S. and the UK in the 70s and 80s , '' said Mahmoud Shammam , Doha-based spokesman for the rebels . `` So they know the situation there very well . They know the ugliness of the regime . '' Could Qatar also be working for Washington ? Before the war , U.S. companies had large investments in Libya , with majors ConocoPhillips and Marathon involved in direct production deals with Gaddafi 's Libyan National Oil Co. . Now consultants and deal-brokers in Benghazi are struck by the low numbers of American fixers relative to their European peers . `` To some extent they may be acting as a U.S. proxy . Washington wants to achieve things but does n't want to do it with its own hands , '' said a London-based risk consultant who has European firms as clients . Qatar hosts a large U.S. military base ; its decision to contribute planes to police the no-fly zone over Libya helped Washington argue that the western-led air strikes had Arab support . Its importance there was underscored by its ruler 's visit to Washington in April . `` We would not have been able , I think , to shape the kind of broad-based international coalition that includes not only our NATO members but also includes Arab states , without the emir 's leadership , '' U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters that month after meeting the emir in the Oval office . Diplomats also point to strains in U.S.-Saudi relations as proof of -- or perhaps even reason for -- improved ties between Washington and Qatar , pointing to events in Bahrain where U.S. calls for negotiation to end a recent uprising stood in stark contrast to Saudi Arabia 's decision to send in troops . Qatar 's stand is certainly appreciated by European countries , whose diplomats argue that the emirate is playing a smart multi-polar game . `` The Qataris are replacing the Saudis on certain agendas , '' said a French diplomat based in Europe . Qatar 's emir has twice been guest of honor at France 's annual Bastille Day parade since 2007 and the emirate has stakes in Airbus parent EADS , energy group EDF and construction firm Vinci . In 2008 , France also passed a law granting special tax exemptions to the emir and other Qatari investors who had bought property in Paris . BLOW TO QATARI RISK PROFILE Despite wide-ranging support in the West , Qatar 's actions in Libya have created unease among its neighbors . Qatar has long played the role of intermediary in the region . Though it is close to Washington and Saudi Arabia , it also has ties to Iran . Foreign firms , including almost all the world 's major oil companies , have invested tens of billions of dollars in projects with Qatar even though they know its gas reserves are , in effect , shared with Iran . The Iranian part is the South Pars field while the Qatari part is known as the North Field .

NATO air strikes resumed in Tripoli on Wednesday night after a lull that followed the heaviest day of bombings since March . Thousands of Gaddafi troops advanced on Misrata on Wednesday , shelling it from three sides and killing at least 12 rebels . Ministers from the so-called Libya contact group , including the United States , France and Britain , as well as Arab allies Qatar , Kuwait and Jordan , agreed in May to set up a fund to help the rebels in the civil war . They are expected to firm up this commitment in the United Arab Emirates capital and press the rebels to give a detailed plan on how they would run the country if Gaddafi stood down as leader of the oil producing North African desert state . `` The international community is beginning to talk about what could constitute end-game to this , '' one senior U.S. official told reporters aboard U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's plane which landed in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday night . `` That would obviously include some kind of cease-fire arrangement and some kind of political process ... and of course the question of Gaddafi and perhaps his family is also a key part of that , '' the U.S. official said . Both Libya 's rebel Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- and its Western allies have rejected Libyan government cease-fire offers that do not include Gaddafi 's departure , saying he and his family must relinquish power before any talks can begin . The U.S. official said there have been general discussions about what might happen to Gaddafi but nothing specific on `` where he should go , or whether he should remain in Libya for that matter . '' U.S. officials on Wednesday announced delivery of the TNC 's first U.S. oil sale , part of a broader strategy they hope will get money flowing to the cash starved group . U.S. oil refiner Tesoro announced in May it had purchased the 1.2 million barrel cargo , which U.S. officials said was due to arrive in Hawaii on Wednesday aboard a tanker chartered by Swiss oil trader Vitol . British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt , who will be at the Abu Dhabi talks , said the group would be briefed by the International Stabilisation Response Team which is helping the rebel council plan for post-conflict rebuilding . `` The contact group will also reiterate the unequivocal message ... that Gaddafi , his family and his regime have lost all legitimacy and must go so that the Libyan people can determine their own future , '' Burt said . `` Until Gaddafi does so , the pressure will increase across the board : economically , politically and militarily . '' NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday , but there were few signs of willingness to intensify their Libya mission , which after four months has failed to oust Gaddafi . The alliance says the bombing aims to protect civilians from the Libyan leader 's military , which crushed popular protests against his rule in February , leaving many dead . The conflict has now become a civil war . Gaddafi says the rebels are a minority of Islamist militants and the NATO campaign is an attempt to grab Libya 's oil . On the battlefront , forces loyal to Gaddafi were staging a big push on Misrata . `` He has sent thousands of troops from all sides and they are trying to enter the city . They are still outside , though , '' rebel spokesman Hassan al-Misrati told Reuters from inside the besieged town . Another rebel spokesman in Misrata , called Mohammed , told Reuters late on Wednesday they were still in control of the city despite the assault . Spain joined other Western and Arab governments in recognizing the Benghazi-based council as the sole representative of the Libyan people . Gaddafi troops and the rebels have been deadlocked for weeks , with neither side able to hold territory on a road between Ajdabiyah in the east , which Gaddafi forces shelled on Monday , and the Gaddafi-held oil town of Brega further west . Rebels control the east of Libya , the western city of Misrata and the range of western mountains near the border with Tunisia . They have been unable to advance on the capital against Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces .

Gaddafi forces also shelled for the first time the world heritage-listed city of Gadamis , some 600 kilometres southwest of the capital on the Tunisia and Algerian border , opening a new front in the five-month long civil war . World powers gave mixed signals on how the deadlocked civil war might play out , with Russia trying to mediate reconciliation . Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday he had offered a `` guarantee '' to Gaddafi if he left Libya , but received no reply . With diplomacy stalling , rebels said fighting was erupting on new fronts . Ahmed Bani , a military spokesman in Benghazi , told Reuters clashes had broken out in Zlitan on Thursday and resumed on Friday with Gaddafi forces killing 22 rebels . Zlitan is one of three towns that are under government control between the rebel-held Misrata and the capital and were it to fall could act as a stepping stone to allow the anti-Gaddafi uprising to spread from Misrata , the biggest rebel outpost in western Libya , to Gaddafi 's stronghold in Tripoli . `` Large numbers of troops are surrounding Zlitan from all directions and are threatening its residents with having their women raped by mercenaries if they do not surrender , '' Bani said , adding the rebels controlled parts of the city . Rebels also said the oasis town of Gadamis with a population of about 7,000 people , mainly Berber , was under attack after an anti-government protest in the old Roman city on Wednesday . `` Gadamis is being shelled by Gaddafi forces , according to witnesses in the town , '' spokesman Juma Ibrahim said from the rebel-held town of Zintan in the Western Mountains region . `` This is a retaliation to anti-regime protests , '' he said . The old town was de-populated by Gaddafi in the 1990s and its inhabitants moved into modern buildings . It was not clear if the attack targeted the old town , a labyrinth of narrow , underground passages and houses known as the `` Pearl of the Desert . '' The accounts in Zlitan and Gadamis could not be independently verified and the Gaddafi government did not immediately comment . In the besieged port city of Misrata , a doctor at the Hekma hospital said 31 people were killed and 110 wounded in government shelling on Friday . The fighting comes after the United States accused some NATO allies on Friday of failing to pull their weight in the campaign against Muammar Gaddafi 's forces , as the Libyan leader kept up shelling of the rebel-held town of Misrata . `` The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly-armed regime in a sparsely-populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , requiring the U.S. , once more , to make up the difference , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a valedictory speech at NATO headquarters in Brussels . Gates 's exasperation has been echoed by rebels , who control the east of the country and some other areas but do not appear to pose an imminent threat to Gaddafi 's rule . Turkey , which is a member of NATO , said Gaddafi had no way out , but to leave Libya and offered the him an exit . `` We ourselves have offered him this guarantee , via the representatives we 've sent . We told him we would help him to be sent wherever he wanted to be sent . We would discuss the issue with our allies , according to the response we receive . Unfortunately we still have n't got a response from Gaddafi . '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , appearing at the Abu Dhabi meeting of the Libya contact group on Thursday , said talks were under way with people close to Gaddafi who had raised the `` potential '' for a transition of power but added : `` There is not any clear way forward yet . '' Under pressure to come up with plans for a transitional government while still in disarray , the rebels have said the onus is on foreign powers to hasten assistance . `` Our people are dying , '' rebel Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said . `` So my message to our friends is that I hope they walk the walk . '' Gaddafi describes the rebels as al Qaeda terrorists and says foreign intervention is a front for a grab at the country 's oil . Mikhail Margelov , Russia 's Africa envoy , who traveled to Benghazi on Friday , said he would go to Tripoli as soon as NATO provided a corridor through its Libyan no-fly zone .

You better believe that NO ONE would be leaving Gaddafi to stand alone if NATO was not there for the rebels . People only leave Gaddafi only because there is only one outcome from this awesome one sided unjustified intervention by NATO and the us .

Most perpetrators go unpunished as sexual violence thrives in a climate of impunity where victims are denied justice or reparations , said Margot Wallstrom , special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict . `` Sexual violence has become a tactic of choice for armed groups , being cheaper , more destructive and easier to get away with than other methods of warfare , '' she told a news briefing . Wallstrom , making her first speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council since taking up the post in March 2010 , called for all countries caught up in conflict to prevent such war crimes and prosecute soldiers or commanders under suspicion . `` Violence against women is no more permissible in times of war than it is in times of peace . And yet , in contemporary conflicts , women and girls are the primary targets of sexual violence , including as a tactic of war , '' she told the forum . Her office is drawing up a blacklist to ` name and shame ' states who may be subject to Security Council sanctions , under a resolution adopted last December , according to Wallstrom . It will probably start with Democratic Republic of the Congo , where at least 200,000 women and girls have been abused , although some estimates are 20 times that figure , she said . In Liberia , which is recovering from 14 years of intermittent civil war in which rape was rampant , it is still the most reported crime , she said . International Criminal Court investigators have evidence linking Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to a policy of raping opponents and may bring separate charges on the issue , ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday . Cherif Bassiouni , head of a U.N. rights inquiry which went to areas controlled by both rebels and Gaddafi , appeared to cast doubt on the ICC report Thursday , although his team 's report accused government forces of murder , torture and abduction . Bassiouni said each side had accused the other of deploying fighters armed with impotency drugs to carry out rapes , creating what he called a `` massive hysteria '' in Libya . His team uncovered only four alleged cases -- Eman Al-Obaidi who claimed she was gang-raped by pro-government militiamen and three women in Misrata who said they had been sexually abused . `` Can we draw a conclusion that there is a systematic policy of rape ? In my opinion we ca n't , '' Bassiouni said . `` For the time being , the numbers are very limited . '' But Wallstrom , a former Swedish minister , said information collected by her office backed Moreno-Ocampo 's view . `` Everything we see and hear reported points to that , '' she told reporters . `` What we have is consistent reports from people , from organizations , from U.N. entities and others on the ground , '' she added . `` It is difficult to give you a figure , but this is part of the arsenal , the weaponry that Gaddafi 's troops use . '' Sharia-inspired laws in Libya and Sudan that can be used to punish a rape victim should be scrapped , Wallstrom said . `` I understand in their -LRB- Libyan -RRB- legislation for example , you could be flogged . Very often women who report rape can themselves be accused of adultery or risk this kind of punishment , '' she said , adding that Sudan allows stoning . Political leaders must ensure that laws are modern and women do not run a risk in just reporting a rape , she said . `` That is what they all have to look at so it is not stone-age legislation as well that will prevent women from actually coming forward . They will never get the reports on rape if this is the risk that women run .

Two Reuters reporters traveling via the town , which lies just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- outside of Tripoli , on two separate trips six hours apart , were diverted via backstreets with a police escort while the fighting raged on . They said the highway was deserted except for lots of soldiers , police and armed men in civilian clothes . One heard bursts of gunfire coming from the direction of the city . `` The situation is very bad in Zawiyah . There 's been fierce fighting since the morning , '' said the resident , who gave only his first name , Mohammed , fearing reprisals . Four months since Gaddafi 's forces crushed a popular uprising against his four-decade rule that then morphed into an armed rebellion , Libya 's civil war is in stalemate . Nearly three months of bombings by NATO war planes against Libyan military targets have failed to unseat Gaddafi or enable the rebels to launch an offensive on his territory in Tripoli . Several explosions were heard in Tripoli throughout the afternoon , as late as 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- , suggesting NATO was ramping up attacks after a quiet morning . Libya TV reported that `` the imperialist aggressors '' had bombed several sites in and around the Libyan capital , in the town of Yafran , then showed footage of what it said were children wounded in past NATO bombings , to violin music . Rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani said a senior Gaddafi aide had been wounded in a NATO strike on a city close to Tripoli on Saturday evening and was in hospital . There was no independent confirmation and Libyan officials were not available to comment . The rebels control the east of Libya , the western city of Misrata and the range of mountains near the border with Tunisia . They are seeking to encircle the capital and cut it off , an aim that would be advanced if they manage to capture Zawiyah . The highway has been used throughout the conflict by Gaddafi 's officials -- including fleeing defectors -- to reach the outside world , and by trucks bringing in food and other supplies to territory under Gaddafi 's control . After a lull in fighting in the western , rebel-held city of Misrata , pro-Gaddafi forces which have besieging it started shelling its port late Saturday , Al Jazeera TV reported . A doctor at the Hekma hospital said 31 people were killed and 110 wounded in shelling by Gaddafi forces Friday . Pro-Gaddafi troops encircled the city of Zlitan , 160 km east of Tripoli , Saturday , rebels said , after fighting broke out there that could also open up the coastal road to the capital . Some clashes between Gaddafi 's forces and rebels continued in the city , rebel spokesman Bani said , after the rebels took some parts of it . The toll remained 22 rebels killed . Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim played down the clashes . `` There is no serious fighting going on in Zawiya or Zlitan . What has happened is that we 've had small groups of rebels who have made their way from Zintan and the Western Mountains to cause trouble in these areas , '' he told Reuters . Zlitan is one of three towns that are largely government controlled between the rebel-held Misrata and the capital .

Dmitry Rogozin also said the conflict could have dire consequences for Europe by stoking hatred of the West . `` It is our observation that NATO is sliding down and being dragged more and more into the eventuality of a land-based operation in Libya , '' he told a news conference during a visit to London . Asked if he believed NATO was trying to assassinate Gaddafi , Rogozin said : `` Well yes . Your chief of defense has declared Gaddafi 's assassination as an eventual target . '' He was apparently referring to a suggestion in March by British Defense Secretary Liam Fox , later contradicted by other officials , that killing Gaddafi was a possible option . Rogozin , speaking through an interpreter , said NATO was choosing targets and then declaring them to be legitimate . `` If Gaddafi or some people close to him sent a fax from some building in Libya , than immediately that building is declared as a military target , '' he said . NATO , armed with a U.N. resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya , has been striking Libyan targets for nearly three months with the aim of protecting civilians from attack by Gaddafi 's forces . Russia , which abstained in the March U.N. Security Council vote authorizing military intervention , has accused the Western coalition of going beyond its mandate . The U.N. resolution bars an occupation force in Libya and Britain has ruled out a ground invasion . However , some politicians see France and Britain 's deployment of attack helicopters as an escalation of their involvement . The military intervention in Libya was very dangerous , Rogozin said , asking if Britain had not had enough war in Iraq and Afghanistan . `` What is happening in Tripoli is a real civil war and it is complicated by the inter-tribe contradictions and to intervene in this situation will mean to confuse this conflict and to exacerbate the situation even more , '' he said . `` It will lead up to the internationalization of this conflict with all the consequences for Europe in terms of extremism in Europe and hatred for the West ...

I suppose it 's not surprising that France wants to flex its muscle in Africa since it plays its hand in all the former French colonies , but I 'm amazed that the UK could really be so hawkish -- especially in light of the draconian austerity they 've impose on their own people .

It said just under half of the total 37.65 billion dinars -LRB- $ 31.4 billion -RRB- would be used to pay salaries . It appeared to be an attempt by Muammar Gaddafi to show his government was still solvent despite a civil war pitting his forces against rebels looking to end his 41-year rule . Libya 's former central bank governor Farhat Bengdara , who defected in March was quoted this week , as saying the Gaddafi government had just $ 500 million left in cash at the end of February , although it still held about 155 tonnes of gold bars . An International Monetary Fund report put Libya 's net foreign assets held by the central bank and the sovereign wealth fund at $ 150 billion at the end of 2010 . Some of these assets were abroad and have been seized as part of sanctions against Libya .

UNITED NATIONS | Wed Jun 15 , 2011 11:32 pm BST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.N. Security Council permanent member Britain urged the African Union on Wednesday to send a strong message that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi must step down if civil war is to end in the North African state . Britain 's U.N. ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told the grouping it should subordinate its peace efforts in Libya to those of the United Nations and that there could be no cease-fire as long as Gaddafi remained in power . Lyall Grant 's statement at a Security Council meeting with the AU came a day after South African President Jacob Zuma , who has visited Libya twice for the bloc to seek a solution to the conflict , said NATO military action there had gone too far . In a speech to the council earlier on Wednesday , an AU representative called for an `` immediate humanitarian pause '' to allow relief supplies to reach Libyan civilians , followed by a cease-fire linked to political negotiations on a settlement . Following the speech by Mauritanian Foreign Minister Hamady Ould Hamady , the council and an AU delegation held a closed meeting where Lyall Grant defended NATO bombing of Gaddafi 's forces in pursuit of a council resolution calling for Libyan civilians to be protected . `` Gaddafi continues to launch attacks against his own people . So long as he continues to do so , the coalition will take action to enforce the Security Council 's resolutions , '' Lyall Grant said in a text issued by Britain 's U.N. mission . Since the latest resolution was passed on March 17 , the United States , Britain and France have played a leading role in attacking Gaddafi 's troops fighting against rebels who hold the east of the country . Lyall Grant said the AU had a `` central role '' to play in Libya peace efforts , but it must be `` coordinated with , and led by , the United Nations , '' under U.N. special envoy for Libya Abdelilah al-Khatib . `` It is important that parallel negotiation tracks do not open up , otherwise there will be a very real risk that Gaddafi will seek to exploit any perceived divisions in the international approach , which could inadvertently prolong the conflict , '' he said . `` Many African countries ... recognize the need for Gaddafi 's departure . We hope that this can translate into a strong message from the African Union to the regime . '' Lyall Grant , whose audience included South African Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane , made no direct reference to Zuma , whose last visit to Libya late last month was inconclusive . Zuma has said Gaddafi wants an end to NATO bombing as a prelude to talks , terms the rebels reject . `` It is clear that a cease-fire with Gaddafi in place would not be credible , '' the British envoy said . `` Gaddafi has already declared a number of ceasefires , and he has broken every one of them . '' Since March , the Security Council has lost unanimity over Libya .

But after spending months in a rebel prison as a suspected government loyalist , the doctor says he has lost faith in the revolution against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . Speaking inside a grimy cell in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , the 28-year-old physician said he was captured by advancing rebel forces in the Mediterranean port of Ras Lanuf in March for working at a state-run hospital . `` When I was working in the hospital , I was a strong supporter of the revolution . But now my beliefs have changed , '' he said as he reclined on an old rug inside his dimly lit cell . `` I still believe Gaddafi should leave . But I do n't support the revolution any more . We are in a state of civil war . It 's difficult to solve problems by force . Every drop of blood will make it worse . '' The military detention facility , its facade peppered with bullet holes , was set up by the rebels early in the conflict to house government troops captured during fighting around Libya . Most of the 75 detainees are soldiers and officers but a handful of people , like Abdullah , were civilians . Snatched as Gaddafi loyalists in the confusion of the early days of the conflict , they are now stuck in limbo , unable to prove their loyalties and go back to their families . Some , like Abdullah , are bitter and disillusioned . `` No one has been charged with anything here . We have been told that we are here for security reasons , as POWs , '' Abdullah , who asked not to use his surname , said in fluent English . `` Once I talked to my family . Once , a month ago . I spoke to my brother . We were instructed not to give any information about how we are being treated . I told them I am okay , in a safe place , that 's it , '' he added . For their captors , they are the inevitable victims of a messy and protracted war . Prison authorities have promised to release everyone -- both civilians and soldiers -- once the war is over and there is a proper mechanism for their departure . `` They all come from their tribes . When Gaddafi dies or flees , we will have a big tribal meeting and people will come here from their tribes and they will take their people away , '' said Captain Tariq Muftah , 40 , a senior prison warden . Before becoming a prison , the facility housed administrative offices under Gaddafi 's rule , rebels said . Broken furniture was scattered around its crumbling rooms and corridors when Reuters was allowed to visit it this week . Small cells housing up to five men lined the main corridor . Detainees sat in their cells on old striped rugs and blankets . Surrounded by heaps of clothes and rubbish , they stared blankly at passing visitors through iron bars . Some smoked and played cards . Flies buzzed around in the thick , stale air . Pictures of helicopter gunships were scribbled on the walls . People 's faces were gaunt . Some refused to speak altogether . Gritting his teeth and unable to hold back his tears , one man , his eyes swollen and cheeks drawn , whispered that he used to be a fighter pilot . Then he turned away to face the wall . Prison wardens accompanying Reuters confirmed people 's stories . Reuters was not allowed to take video or still images . Sitting on a grubby mattress in the corridor , Abdusalam Osman , 23 , said he was working in a car parts workshop near Ajdabiyah when he was seized by Gaddafi soldiers in March . He said he was subsequently released and returned to the rebel-held east , only to be detained this time by rebel forces suspicious of his experience while in government detention . `` I am not a soldier . I work in a workshop fixing cars . So now we are here , '' he said , pointing at three other men sitting nearby who he said were also civilians from his home town . `` Revolutionaries caught me . They said : We are not sure you are on our side , you are coming from Gaddafi 's side , so you are going to prison . I believe in the revolution . Every day they tell me : Tomorrow you will be released , '' he added with a shrug . Human Rights Watch , whose researchers have visited the facility , said prisoners were generally being treated well . `` There have been some problems at the point of capture . A few detainees told us they were mistreated or shot after they were caught on the frontlines ... , '' Sidney Kwiram of Human Rights Watch told Reuters . `` It is critical that the opposition authorities demonstrate unambiguous leadership on how to treat captured Gaddafi forces and that they continue to underline their message about humane treatment , including to their fighters on the frontlines . '' Speaking to Reuters as their captors looked on , most Gaddafi soldiers said they now supported the revolution . `` I was told in -LRB- my hometown of -RRB- Sirt as a soldier that Benghazi was full of al Qaeda . So I went to fight them , '' said Nasrdin Mohammed , an army sergeant detained on March 15 . `` Then I realized I was on the wrong side . Now I just want freedom . '' Then he added quietly : `` I was promised to be released once Gaddafi 's government collapses but I do n't believe that . I do n't believe that . I am puzzled .

Libya 's economy relies on oil exports and the rebels have struggled to make ends meet as damage to energy infrastructure caused by the civil war has brought production to a halt in what used to be a major OPEC oil producer in North Africa . Western powers are helping the rebels with daily air strikes against forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , and have promised to expand aid backed by Libyan assets frozen abroad . Speaking to Reuters in a rare interview in the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi , oil and finance minister Ali Tarhouni said the cash had yet to arrive four months into the war . `` We do n't have any -LRB- cash -RRB- . We are running out of everything . It 's a complete failure . Either they -LRB- Western nations -RRB- do n't understand or they do n't care . Nothing has materialized yet . And I really mean nothing , '' he said . `` All of these people we talk to , all of these countries , at all these conferences , with their great grand speeches -- we appreciate -LRB- them -RRB- from the political side , but in terms of finances they are a complete failure . Our people are dying . '' The economy in east Libya is in tatters . The authorities are struggling to find cash to pay for military operations as well as salaries in a society where , thanks to the legacy of Gaddafi 's centralized rule , most people depend on state wages . Western states have offered to help . The European Union has pledged support and Washington , which took a leading role in securing a U.N.-backed no-fly zone over Libya , has promised more aid and offers of loans to keep the rebels afloat . Asked why he thought it was taking Western nations so long to produce money , Tarhouni said : `` No idea . ... I am tired of asking them . '' He had earlier estimated the rebels were spending up to 100 million Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 86 million -RRB- per day . `` I do n't expect us to produce oil any time soon . The refineries have no crude oil , so they are not working , '' he said . `` People died for this revolution and are still dying . We will find a way -LRB- to raise money -RRB- . One thing is for sure : We will never give up . '' Supplies of fuel , vital to keeping eastern towns supplied and maintaining the campaign against Gaddafi , are tight . Tarhouni said that refineries , including the one in Misrata , and other crucial installations had been damaged by the fighting , but the pipelines were still intact . Libya produced 1.6 million barrels per day before the war and exported about 1.3 million bpd . Rebels sold their first tanker full of crude to U.S. refiner Tesoro in April , but production has since ground to a halt due to concerns over the security of the oil fields . Rebels now rely on imports of fuel . Asked about the mechanism of deliveries , Tarhouni said : `` We have signed -LRB- fuel supply -RRB- contracts and we have companies that were gracious enough to delay those payments for the future . `` We get it -LRB- fuel -RRB- basically from these contractors . I personally do n't know where they get it from , but I think it 's just from the spot market , most of it . The companies are international companies . '' He said the rebel authority had put together a budget totaling 3.6 billion Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 2.98 billion -RRB- . `` But my immediate needs are much less than that . I can deal with whatever that I can have access to , '' he said . Tarhouni said the rebel government was holding direct talks with foreign companies on future cooperation , adding that he had no qualms about dealing with those which had earlier worked closely with Gaddafi 's government in the capital Tripoli . Asked which companies he was talking to , he named Germany 's Wintershall and France 's Total . `` We need help , we said we respect and abide by all contracts . The only enemy that I have is Gaddafi and his killers and thugs , '' he said . `` In terms of commerce and companies I have no enemies .

Full Article Libyan officials say NATO hits civilian house TRIPOLI | Sun Jun 19 , 2011 10:53 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan officials said on Sunday a NATO strike had hit a civilian house in the capital Tripoli , killing several residents , and NATO said it was investigating the claim , which could sow new doubts about its mission . On another front in the four-month-old battle to force out Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , a doctor in the city of Misrata said eight rebel fighters had been killed and 36 wounded in fighting with government troops . In the early hours of Sunday , reporters were taken by Libyan government officials to a residential area in Tripoli 's Souq al-Juma district where they saw a body being pulled out of the rubble of a destroyed building . Later , in a hospital , they were shown the bodies of two children and three adults who , officials said , were among a total of seven people killed in the strike . `` There was intentional and deliberate targeting of the civilian houses , '' deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said at the site . `` This is another sign of the brutality of the West . '' There was no way for reporters to verify that all the bodies they were shown came from the building . `` NATO is looking into reports of civilian casualties following NATO air strikes in the early hours of June 19 , '' the alliance said in a statement from Naples , from where it is running the Libyan operation . `` The incident is said to have occurred in a residential area in northern Tripoli , following a deliberate strike which targeted a missile site operated by pro-Gaddafi forces . `` NATO regrets any loss of civilian lives , and is doing all it can to protect the people of Libya from the violence waged by the Gaddafi regime . `` We take all reports of civilian casualties very seriously and we will continue to look into the facts related to this event , '' the alliance said . `` NATO would be sorry if the review of this incident did indicate that it was caused by a NATO weapon . '' At the scene of the destroyed building on Sunday , clothes , smashed crockery and a child 's rubber duck could be seen littered around the area . The building is in a neighborhood where security forces have in the past few weeks put down anti-Gaddafi protests . `` Why is NATO doing this to us ? asked Ibrahim Ali , who said he lived on the same street as the wrecked building . `` NATO is a big problem for the Libyan people . NATO does n't have any business here , this is between the Libyan people . '' Another man , who gave his name as Tony , nodded towards the remains of the building and said : `` They -LRB- local people -RRB- do n't like this ... But they do n't like the regime either . '' On at least one occasion in the past , doubts have emerged about the reliability of Libyan claims of civilian casualties . In one case , Libyan officials presented a wounded child to foreign media as the victim of an air strike but medical staff passed a note to a foreign journalist saying she was hurt in a road accident . If it is proved that Sunday 's deaths were caused by a NATO air strike , it would be the first acknowledged incident of its kind in the campaign and could weaken the fragile resolve of some countries in the alliance . NATO has been pounding targets in Libya for months in what it says is an operation to protect civilians who rebelled against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . The Libyan leader says it is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal oil . Strains are appearing within NATO member states as the campaign drags on for longer than most of its backers anticipated and Gaddafi remains in power -- even making a show of defiance last week by playing chess with a visiting official . Sunday marked three months since NATO warplanes went into action over Libya . Rebels from the city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have been trying to push west towards the capital but on Sunday they took heavy casualties when they came under fire from pro-Gaddafi forces . A doctor at a field hospital near the frontline in Dafniyah , just west of Misrata , said eight fighters had been killed and 36 wounded . A Reuters reporter at the field hospital said he saw a procession of pick-up trucks arriving from the front carrying the wounded and the dead , some of them covered with blankets . `` Gaddafi 's forces were underground -LRB- in trenches -RRB- . We were patrolling and they ambushed us , '' said rebel fighter Mohammed Swelhi , whose friend , Mustafa , was one of two bodies brought from the front in the back of a truck . `` My cousin was injured yesterday . And today my friend was killed . My group , we 're all close friends , '' he said . Last week , NATO aircraft dropped leaflets around the frontline warning pro-Gaddafi fighters they would be targeted by attack helicopters if they did not lay down their arms . But rebels say there has been little sign of the alliance . `` We do n't know what NATO is doing , '' said the doctor , called Nury , who was tending the wounded at the field hospital . After four months of civil war , rebels control the eastern third of Libya , the Mediterranean port city of Misrata and much of the Western Mountains stretching to the border with Tunisia . But they remain far from seizing Gaddafi 's powerbase of Tripoli and its hinterland despite air support from the world 's most powerful military alliance . Speaking in the eastern city of Benghazi , the chief rebel oil official castigated Western powers for failing to make good on their promises to help the rebel cause . `` We are running out of everything . It 's a complete failure . Either they -LRB- Western nations -RRB- do n't understand or they do n't care . Nothing has materialised yet . And I really mean nothing , '' Ali Tarhouni said in an interview with Reuters . `` All of these people we talk to , all of these countries , at all these conferences , with their great grand speeches -- we appreciate -LRB- them -RRB- ... but in terms of finances they are a complete failure .

Rebels have long complained that they are short of cash and have sought access to Libyan money in foreign accounts so they can pay salaries and buy supplies . But allowing them direct access to frozen funds could run afoul of U.N. sanctions . A statement agreed at a meeting in Luxembourg said the European Union acknowledged the urgent financial needs of the rebel transitional council in Libya . `` The mobilization of international resources , including where possible through the use of Libyan frozen funds , in compliance with the provisions of the relevant UNSCRs -LRB- United Nations Security Council Resolutions -RRB- , is key to support the inclusive transition process aimed at fostering national reconciliation , '' the statement said . The statement added that `` measures in this regard will respect the rule of law . '' Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the EU was looking at using frozen assets as collateral to raise funds for the rebels , as only the U.N. Security Council could decide to unfreeze assets . `` We are looking into using frozen assets as guarantees to give loans in advance , '' to the Libyan rebels , '' he told reporters . `` We are not looking into unfreezing frozen assets . '' Libya 's cash-strapped rebel authority said on Sunday it expected to start replenishing its empty coffers this week with the first batch of money promised by its foreign allies . The rebels say they need more than $ 3 billion to cover salaries and other needs in the next six months and have won promises of financial assistance from Western and Arab supporters . Libya 's economy relies on oil exports and the rebels have struggled to make ends meet as damage to energy infrastructure caused by the civil war has brought production to a halt in what used to be a major OPEC oil producer in North Africa . The European Union has imposed sanctions , including asset freezes , on dozens of Libyan individuals and companies seen as supporters of Gaddafi in an effort to persuade him to give up power . They include firms in the oil sector . A bill that would allow President Barack Obama to use up to $ 10 billion in frozen Libyan government assets for humanitarian aid to Libyans caught in the civil war has stalled in the Senate . The United States is holding more than $ 34 billion as part of sanctions imposed in late February against Gaddafi and his top officials .

It was the first time NATO had acknowledged causing multiple civilian casualties in Libya and came as the alliance feels the strain of a campaign taking more time and resources than expected . NATO said the intended target was a missile site . The head of its Libya operations said he regretted the loss of life and that a system failure may have knocked the weapon off course . Libyan officials accused NATO of deliberately targeting the population and blamed the alliance for further civilian deaths in the southern town of Sebha and in Surman west of Tripoli . `` NATO is endangering its credibility ; we can not risk killing civilians , '' Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told reporters before an EU foreign ministers ' meeting in Luxembourg to discuss ways to aid rebels trying to oust Muammar Gaddafi . Frattini expressed concern that NATO was losing the propaganda war to Gaddafi and that Western media reports did not emphasise enough the good work done by the alliance every day to protect Libyan civilians . `` We can not continue our shortcomings in the way we communicate with the public , which does n't keep up with the daily propaganda of Gaddafi , '' he said . NATO was continuing with its three-month campaign of air strikes on Monday . A Reuters reporter in central Tripoli said he heard jets overhead around midday , then a distant explosion . There were no details immediately available on what the strike had hit . Libyan official news agency JANA said air strikes killed four civil defense staff and wounded 10 others on Sunday when they rushed to provide first aid for people at civilian sites hit by the coalition in Sebha . Government officials took reporters to Surman , 70km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , to the site of what they said was a NATO strike targeting the home of Khouildi Hamidi , a member of the 12-member Revolutionary Command Council that Gaddafi set up after seizing control of Libya in 1969 . The government said 15 civilians were killed , including three children . Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a `` cowardly terrorist act which can not be justified .

Libyan Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi said the NATO strike was a `` pathetic attempt ... to break the spirit of the people of Tripoli and allow small numbers of terrorists to cause instability and disorder in the peaceful city '' . A spokesman for the rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule said the Libyan leader was to blame . `` We are sorry for the loss of civilian life that was caused by air strikes carried out by NATO , '' said Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , vice chairman of the rebel National Transitional Council . `` We hold the Gaddafi regime responsible for having placed its military -LRB- installations -RRB- near civilian areas , '' he said . `` So these losses are to be expected .

Libyan officials took reporters to Surman , 70 km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , to the site of what they said was a NATO air strike on the home of Khouildi Hamidi , a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . Rescue teams were looking for survivors while reporters visited the site . Reporters were then taken to a hospital in nearby Sabrata where they were shown nine bodies , including those of two children , plus some body parts , which the Libyan government said were all of people killed in the attack . The state-run Jana news agency later reported on its website that eight children were among 19 people killed in the attack . The dead included members of Hamidi 's family , it said . The government said Hamidi himself was not hurt . NATO said it had bombed a `` legitimate military target -- a command and control node '' in the area , and it could not confirm whether civilians had been hurt . It said NATO does not target specific individuals . `` This strike will greatly degrade the Gaddafi regime forces ' ability to carry on their barbaric assault against the Libyan people , '' Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , the Canadian commander of NATO 's Libya operation , said in a statement . If the Libyan government 's account of civilian deaths is confirmed , the incident could further complicate operations of the NATO-led military alliance , starting to feel the strain of a campaign that is taking longer and costing more than planned . NATO acknowledged on Sunday for the first time that it had killed multiple civilians in Libya , when a strike intended to hit a missile site erred and destroyed a house in Tripoli . Bouchard said he regretted the loss of life in that incident , and a system failure may have knocked the weapon off course . Libyan officials say NATO forces have killed more than 700 civilians , although they have not presented evidence of such large numbers of civilian deaths and NATO denies them . Libya says one of Gaddafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed six weeks ago when Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound was hit . Italy 's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Monday civilian deaths pose a risk to the NATO-led military alliance . NATO states have been hitting targets in Libya since March 19 in what they say is an operation to protect civilians . `` NATO is endangering its credibility ; we can not risk killing civilians , '' Frattini told reporters before an EU foreign ministers ' meeting in Luxembourg to discuss ways to aid rebels . The Arab League , which in March asked the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians , condemned the loss of life in Sunday 's incident . `` When the Arab League agreed on the idea of having a no-fly zone over Libya it was to protect civilians but when civilians get killed this has to be condemned with the harshest of statements , '' said Deputy Secretary-General Ahmed Ben Helli . The Libyan leader says the Western-led military campaign is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal Libya 's oil . Libyan officials accused NATO of deliberately targeting the population . Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called Monday 's strike on Hamidi 's house `` a cowardly terrorist act . '' Frattini expressed concern that NATO was losing the propaganda war : `` We can not continue our shortcomings in the way we communicate with the public , which does n't keep up with the daily propaganda of Gaddafi . '' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States joined NATO in regretting loss of civilian life . `` These missions are extremely difficult . They are extremely dangerous . We faced this situation in Afghanistan , we faced it in the past in Kosovo , '' she said . `` It 's always an issue in any NATO mission to maintain popular support , to maintain public understanding for why we are there ... '' Ashour Shamis , a UK-based Libyan opposition activist , said Hamidi played a key role in Gaddafi 's war against the rebels . `` He is very much there , controlling the army and supervising military activities , '' he said . NATO continued its three-month campaign of air strikes on Monday . A Reuters reporter in central Tripoli said he heard jets overhead around midday , then a distant explosion . There were no details immediately available on what was hit . The rebels have made slow progress since NATO countries joined the fight three months ago , but are now advancing toward Tripoli from a bastion in Misrata east of the capital and from the Western Mountains region to its southwest . Shelling attacks by loyalist forces positioned outside Misrata killed 11 civilians in the rebel-held coastal city on Monday , a doctor at the main hospital there said by phone . Those included a child who was killed when a salvo of three rockets fired by Gaddafi forces hit a built-up area near the port , a Reuters reporter said . Two more children were wounded . A rebel at the scene named Hassan Douwa said : `` Is NATO waiting for Gaddafi to kill us all before it does its job ? Give us the planes and we will do it ourselves . '' Rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan in Misrata said Gaddafi 's forces intensified their shelling of Misrata on Monday , with at least 20 rockets landing in the city center . Rebels in the Western Mountains said they had shut off a pipeline that supplies crude from an oilfield in the south to the Zawiyah refinery near the capital Tripoli . The refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi-held areas . `` This is an attempt by the rebels to stifle the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli , '' rebel spokesman Juma Ibrahim said by phone from the Western Mountains town of Zintan . Rebels have been boosted by defections of Gaddafi loyalists . They said on Monday 22 soldiers had defected from a unit in the south . Gaddafi officials say defections have not made a significant dent in government forces . Rebel diplomatic chief Mahmoud Jibril is due on Tuesday to travel to China , which has not taken a firm side in Libya 's civil war but has tried to expand ties with the opposition . EU foreign ministers agreed at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday to look into the possibility of using frozen Libyan funds to assist the rebels . The rebel oil and finance minister accused the West on Saturday of failing to keep promises of vital financial aid , leaving the rebels without any money to continue their four-month campaign to unseat Gaddafi . In a joint statement they said the European Union acknowledged the urgent financial needs of the rebel transitional council , which requires more than $ 3 billion to cover salaries and other needs in the next six months .

How many hundreds or thousands of lives were lost by such dawdling ? Why ca n't they take out Gaddafi in the same way we took out Osama bin Laden ?

Full Article CORRECTED - Fresh Libya civilian deaths pile pressure on NATO Tue Jun 21 , 2011 5:05 am IST -LRB- removes reference in para 4 to Hamidi 's wife and children being among dead -RRB- SURMAN , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Libyan government said on Monday 19 civilians were killed in a NATO air strike on the home of one of Muammar Gaddafi 's top officials , a day after NATO admitted killing civilians in a separate aerial attack . Libyan officials took reporters to Surman , 70 km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , to the site of what they said was a NATO air strike on the home of Khouildi Hamidi , a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . Rescue teams were looking for survivors while reporters visited the site . Reporters were then taken to a hospital in nearby Sabrata where they were shown nine bodies , including those of two children , plus some body parts , which the Libyan government said were all of people killed in the attack . The state-run Jana news agency later reported on its website that eight children were among 19 people killed in the attack . The dead included members of Hamidi 's family , it said . The government said Hamidi himself was not hurt . NATO said it had bombed a `` legitimate military target -- a command and control node '' in the area , and it could not confirm whether civilians had been hurt . It said NATO does not target specific individuals . `` This strike will greatly degrade the Gaddafi regime forces ' ability to carry on their barbaric assault against the Libyan people , '' Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , the Canadian commander of NATO 's Libya operation , said in a statement . If the Libyan government 's account of civilian deaths is confirmed , the incident could further complicate operations of the NATO-led military alliance , starting to feel the strain of a campaign taking longer and costing more than planned . NATO acknowledged on Sunday for the first time that it had killed multiple civilians in Libya , when a strike intended to hit a missile site erred and destroyed a house in Tripoli . Bouchard said he regretted the loss of life in that incident , and a system failure may have knocked the weapon off course . Libyan officials say NATO forces have killed more than 700 civilians , although they have not presented evidence of such large numbers of civilian deaths and NATO denies them . Libya says one of Gaddafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed six weeks ago when Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound was hit . Italy 's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Monday civilian deaths pose a risk to the NATO-led military alliance . NATO states have been hitting targets in Libya since March 19 in what they say is an operation to protect civilians . `` NATO is endangering its credibility ; we can not risk killing civilians , '' Frattini told reporters before an EU foreign ministers ' meeting in Luxembourg to discuss ways to aid rebels . The Arab League , which in March asked the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians , condemned the loss of life in Sunday 's incident . `` When the Arab League agreed on the idea of having a no-fly zone over Libya it was to protect civilians but when civilians get killed this has to be condemned with the harshest of statements , '' said Deputy Secretary-General Ahmed Ben Helli . The Libyan leader says the Western-led military campaign is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal Libya 's oil . Libyan officials accused NATO of deliberately targeting the population . Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called Monday 's strike on Hamidi 's house `` a cowardly terrorist act '' . Frattini expressed concern that NATO was losing the propaganda war : `` We can not continue our shortcomings in the way we communicate with the public , which does n't keep up with the daily propaganda of Gaddafi '' . State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States joined NATO in regreting loss of civilian life . `` These missions are extremely difficult . They are extremely dangerous . We faced this situation in Afghanistan , we faced it in the past in Kosovo , '' she said . `` It 's always an issue in any NATO mission to maintain popular support , to maintain public understanding for why we are there ... '' Ashour Shamis , a UK-based Libyan opposition activist , said Hamidi played a key role in Gaddafi 's war against the rebels . `` He is very much there , controlling the army and supervising military activities , '' he said . NATO continued its three-month campaign of air strikes on Monday . A Reuters reporter in central Tripoli said he heard jets overhead around midday , then a distant explosion . There were no details immediately available on what was hit . The rebels have made slow progress since NATO countries joined the fight three months ago , but are now advancing towards Tripoli from a bastion in Misrata east of the capital and from the Western Mountains region to its southwest . A child was killed and two others were wounded when three rockets fired by Gaddafi forces hit a built-up area near the port in Misrata on Monday , a Reuters reporter said . A rebel at the scene named Hassan Douwa said : `` Is NATO waiting for Gaddafi to kill us all before it does its job ? Give us the planes and we will do it ourselves . '' A rebel spokesman in Misrata said on Monday NATO had been increasingly using Apache helicopters to target Gaddafi forces near the city . Rebels in the Western Mountains said they had shut off a pipeline that supplies crude from an oilfield in the south to the Zawiyah refinery near the capital Tripoli . The refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi-held areas . `` This is an attempt by the rebels to stifle the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli , '' rebel spokesman Juma Ibrahim said by phone from the Western Mountains town of Zintan . Rebels have been boosted by defections of Gaddafi loyalists . They said on Monday 22 soldiers had defected from a unit in the south . Gaddafi officials say defections have not made a significant dent in government forces . Rebel diplomatic chief Mahmoud Jibril is due on Tuesday to travel to China , which has not taken a firm side in Libya 's civil war but has tried to expand ties with the opposition . EU foreign ministers agreed at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday to look into the possibility of using frozen Libyan funds to assist the rebels . The rebel oil and finance minister accused the West on Saturday of failing to keep promises of vital financial aid , leaving the rebels without any money to continue their four-month campaign to unseat Gaddafi . In a joint statement they said the European Union acknowledged the urgent financial needs of the rebel transitional council , which needs more than $ 3 billion to cover salaries and other needs in the next six months .

This oversupply is most manifest in Europe , which has become the market of last resort for LNG supply , '' Noel Tomnay , Wood Mackenzie 's head of global gas , said . Japan , the world 's largest importer of liquefied natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- , has seen the demand for the fuel jump after the earthquake earlier this year crippled several of its nuclear reactors and forced some of its coal-fired plants to shut . The increases in Japanese demand have reduced LNG supply to Europe by over 12 billion cubic meters -LRB- bcm -RRB- or 8.8 million tonnes of LNG in 2011 , according to Wood Mackenzie . Japan 's demand for the super-cooled fuel is expected to continue growing . Analysts expect demand up by about 8 to 10 million tonnes this year from 70 million tonnes in 2010 . The nuclear crisis in Japan also spurred worries about the safety of nuclear technology with Germany deciding to shut all its nuclear plants by 2022 as a result and other nations calling for safety tests of their own nuclear systems . As the gas glut ebbs , spot prices may climb higher than contract prices , Wood Mackenzie said . Contract prices are currently typically higher than spot prices due to the supply security they provide . Supplies are also likely to dwindle as political upheaval continues in Middle Eastern countries such as Libya . `` Political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa - notably the Libyan civil war and the corresponding Greenstream pipe capacity outage -- has removed 8 bcm of contracted gas , '' Tomnay said . Japanese demand and Middle Eastern production cuts have eroded Europe 's gas supply cushion to less than 10 bcm , the equivalent of 7.3 million tonnes of LNG , in 2011 . Unplanned outages like those that have occurred in Nigeria and Algeria during the last two years may add to supply tightness . `` The potential for future unplanned LNG outages to disrupt the smooth running of global LNG capacity can not be ruled out , whether they are technical challenges or the result of recent unrest , as that presently seen in Yemen , '' Tomnay said . `` Should such outages coincide with a cold winter , such an event combined with ongoing Libyan gas supply disruption could remove Europe 's gas cushion entirely by as early as winter of 2012 .

But Obama was delivered a symbolic rebuke hours earlier when lawmakers refused another measure to formally authorize U.S. participation in the NATO-led Libya mission . The twin votes starkly highlighted the ambivalence on Capitol Hill over U.S. involvement in Libya 's civil war . Some lawmakers argue that Obama violated the 1973 War Powers Act by failing to secure Congressional authorization after 60 days of hostilities , an argument the White House rejects . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the administration was gratified the House had `` decisively rejected '' efforts to restrict funding for U.S. involvement in the operation , adding that it was important to keep up the pressure on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . The measure would have allowed U.S. forces to continue providing reconnaissance , refueling , planning and other services to the NATO-led mission in the North African nation but would have barred them from carrying out both manned and drone air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces . Since NATO took over the Libya operation on March 31 , the United States has conducted 755 strike sorties , including 119 in which the planes actually fired at targets . Thirty-nine of the strikes involved the use of drone aircraft . The White House , however , expressed disappointment over the failure of the separate Democratic-backed measure that would have authorized the United States to continue its limited involvement in the Libya mission for a year . `` Now is not the time to send the kind of mixed message that it sends when we are working with our allies to achieve the goals that we believe are widely shared in Congress , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said . `` The writing is on the wall for Colonel Gaddafi and now is not the time to let up . '' The congressional actions were another warning to Obama about growing discontent among lawmakers after a decade of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have cost more than $ 1 trillion and have helped fuel a $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit . The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission against Libya more than three months ago , aiming to prevent Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians in regions opposed to his rule . The U.N. authorized a no-fly zone and an arms embargo to put additional pressure on Gaddafi . The mission now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power . The House , which is controlled by Republicans , voted 180-238 to reject the Republican measure to curb U.S. involvement in Libya . Eighty-nine Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it . Both House Speaker John Boehner and Representative Buck McKeon , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , had endorsed the measure . Boehner said the House was forced to act because Obama had failed to fulfill his obligation to consult with Congress . `` I support the removal of the Libyan regime ... , '' Boehner said . `` But when the president chooses to challenge the powers of the Congress , I , as speaker of this House , will defend the constitutional authority of the legislature . '' McKeon said the measure would continue to provide NATO with the essential backing it needed to carry out the mission while helping `` the president to be truthful in saying that we 're not engaged in hostile action . '' `` The president has repeatedly stated that the United States is not engaged in hostilities and that congressional authorization is not necessary to continue our role in this operation , '' McKeon added . `` I share with many of my colleagues the view that firing a missile at a target in a foreign nation does indeed constitute hostile action . '' Many lawmakers professed mixed feelings over the vote . Representative Mike Rogers , head of the House intelligence committee , backed the measure and criticized Obama 's failure to explain his Libya policy . But he added `` that does n't change the fact that the United States has important strategic interests in finishing the job there . '' A spokesman for Representative Mike Honda , a leading member of a bloc of left-leaning House Democrats , said the measure had failed because it amounted to a `` back door authorization '' of the Obama administration 's course of action , providing it with funding and legal authority for most of what it was already doing . The House voted 123-295 to reject the resolution that would have authorized Obama to continue with the limited U.S. mission in Libya for a year . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Absolutely , un-American by those members . It makes me sick . I 'm a long-time supporter of Obama , but this conflict in Libya makes me very uneasy . It goes against many of my core beliefs . It feels like delayed revenge for Lockerbie . The Republicans are all hypocritical and all political . I 'm beginning to think that an armed insurrection is the only answer . They are hostile toward the American government and the American Middle Class , just like al Qaeda is . And it 's not due to any real substantive dispute . It 's pure politics and lust for power . They use our country like a whore and when they get through with us there will be nothing left of this country . I think of all the posturing and political attacks the Republicans unleashed on the Democrats when they showed any reluctance to support their invasion of Iraq . Democrats were being unpatriotic , unAmerican . How dare the Democrats not join in with the American people to go after those who struck at the heart of our nation on 9\\/11 , or so they 'd have us believe . Now look at them . At first they were criticizing Obama for doing too little too late . Now they 're refusing to give him any support for at all for merely giving a NATO-led mission some logistical support . Yet if there was a Republican in the White House they 'd be leading the charge . They are SO destructive and hypocritical . These are the people who condemned the Dixie Chicks for just making a negative comment about Bush overseas . And now they wo n't even show our military this much support .

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote marked another round in the debate in Washington over who has the power to make war , sparked by the President Barack Obama 's decision to commit the United States to the Libya conflict in March without asking the U.S. Congress ' approval . The committee voted 14-5 to approve the measure offered by Senator John Kerry , a Democrat , and Senator John McCain , a Republican , both supporters of the Libya intervention . But the House of Representatives has already rejected a similar measure , reflecting the division in Congress over the issue and narrowing the chances that the Kerry-McCain resolution , which first has to be approved by the full Senate , will ever become law . While the Obama administration would like Congress to express support for the Libya mission , it says it does not strictly need formal authorization by Congress . This is because the U.S. military role in the NATO-led Libya operations has been limited , not rising to the level of war or `` hostilities '' under U.S. law , U.S. officials say . This legalistic position , which was explained again to the committee in detail earlier Tuesday by State Department lawyer Harold Koh , has angered or annoyed many in both parties in Congress -- even some of those who support the Libya action . Before passing the resolution , the senators effectively repudiated the administration 's argument by adopting an amendment that said continuation of the Libya operations does require congressional authorization . ALL THOSE WHO VOTED NO WERE REPUBLICANS The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission in March , aiming to prevent Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians opposed to his rule . The mission , NATO-led since the end of March , now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power . The panel 's vote in favor of the resolution was a bipartisan 10 Democrats and four Republicans . All those who voted against the measure were Republicans , including the panel 's top Republican , Richard Lugar , who cited the U.S. debt and two other wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as reasons not to wage war in Libya . `` In light of these circumstances , the lack of U.S. vital interest in Libya , I do not believe that we should be intervening in a civil war there , '' Lugar said . Kerry said that now was not the time to bail out of Libya , with Gaddafi `` bunkered down in Tripoli '' and facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court . `` Do we want to stop this operation ? That 's really what it comes down to , '' Kerry said ahead of the vote . The resolution would authorize the U.S. role in Libya for up to one year after the date of enactment of the resolution by Congress , unless the NATO mission ends sooner . It also says that the removal of Gaddafi is a political goal of U.S. policy , and calls for the United States and NATO to be reimbursed for the costs of the operation from assets seized from Gaddafi 's government . Senator Bob Corker , a Republican who voted against the resolution , said the administration was basically `` sticking a stick in the eye '' of Congress by finding a narrow legal reason not to ask for authorization . `` The chairman mentioned -LRB- that -RRB- since no American is being shot , there 's no hostilities . By that reasoning we could drop a nuclear bomb on Tripoli and we would not be involved in hostilities , and this goes to the sort of preposterous argument that is being made , '' Corker said . Senator Jim Webb , a Democrat , agreed the administration 's argument that the Libyan conflict is not `` hostilities '' was `` contorted , '' but he voted for the authorization resolution . Koh , in his appearance before the committee , declined to comment on reports that Obama ignored the advice of Pentagon and Justice Department lawyers who argued that U.S. military intervention in Libya required congressional authorization . Since NATO took over the Libya operation on March 31 , the United States has conducted 755 strike sorties , including 119 in which the planes fired at targets . Thirty-nine of the strikes involved the use of drone aircraft . The United States has also been providing reconnaissance , refueling , planning and other services to the NATO-led mission . The committee voted down , 14-5 , a proposal by Lugar that would have ruled out U.S. participation in any more air strikes .

France confirmed on Wednesday that it had air-dropped arms to rebels in Libya 's Western Mountains , becoming the first NATO country to acknowledge openly arming the insurgency against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . France , Britain and the United States are leading a three-month-old air campaign which they say they will not end until Gaddafi falls . The war has become the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping North Africa and the Middle East . Rebels acknowledged French support , saying it had helped sustain them in the region . `` There should be no doubt that Libyans in the Nafusa Mountain -LRB- Western Mountains -RRB- area are alive and safe today thanks to a combination of heroic Libyan bravery and French wisdom and support , '' Vice Chairman Abdul Hafeedh Ghoga of the Transitional National Council said in a statement of thanks to French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Though rebel advances have been slow , the insurgents scored a success in the region on Sunday in pushing to the outskirts of Bir al-Ghanam , within 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- of Tripoli . On Thursday the rebels surveyed the strategic town from a ridge overlooking the desert plateau that leads to the capital , in preparation for a possible attack . A Reuters journalist with them said they were waiting for NATO airstrikes to help them . Libyan television broadcast a statement from tribal leaders condemning Sarkozy over the arms , calling the rebels in the Berber area `` a product of France . '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow `` asked our French colleagues today whether reports that weapons from France were delivered to Libyan rebels correspond with reality . '' `` If this is confirmed , it is a very crude violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 , '' he said . That resolution , adopted in February , imposed a comprehensive arms embargo . Paris said on Wednesday it believed it had not violated the U.N. embargo because the weapons it gave the rebels were needed to protect civilians from an imminent attack , which it says is allowed under a later Security Council resolution . `` We believe that U.N. Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , read together , neither specified nor precluded providing defense materiel to the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . `` We would respectfully disagree with the Russian assessment , '' he added . Nevertheless , although legal , arming the rebels was `` not an option that we have acted on , '' he said . Although Russia is not involved in the bombing campaign , its stance could add to reservations among some NATO countries wary over an air war that has lasted longer and cost more than expected . Moscow could also challenge Paris at the U.N. Security Council , where both are veto-wielding permanent members . U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said it was up to the Security Council to determine what is permitted by its resolutions . France 's weapons airlift , while possibly increasing the insurgent threat to Gaddafi , highlights a dilemma for NATO . More than 90 days into its bombing campaign , Gaddafi is still in power and no breakthrough is in sight , making some NATO members feel they should help the rebels more actively , something the poorly-armed insurgents have encouraged . But if they do that , they risk fracturing the international coalition over how far to go . The World Bank 's Libya representative said on Thursday Islamist militants could gain ground if the conflict wears on . `` If this civil war goes on , it would be a new Somalia , which I do n't say lightly , '' said Marouane Abassi , World Bank country manager for Libya who has been in Tunisia since February . `` In three months we could be dealing with extremists . That 's why time is very important in this conflict , before we face problems in managing it . '' Even before news of the French arms supply emerged , fissures were emerging in the coalition with some members voicing frustration about the high cost , civilian casualties , and the elusiveness of a military victory . Gaddafi says the NATO campaign is an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing the North African state 's oil . He says NATO 's U.N.-mandated justification for its campaign -- to protect Libyan civilians from attack -- is spurious . NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen made clear on Thursday the weapons airlift was a unilateral French initiative . Asked by reporters on a visit to Vienna if NATO had been involved , he answered : `` No. '' `` As regards compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolution , it is for the U.N. sanctions committee to determine that , '' Rasmussen said . The rebel advance toward Tripoli 's southwest outskirts from the Western Mountains has not been matched by progress toward the capital from the east , where they hold Misrata on the coast about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- from the capital . The city has been bombarded for months by Gaddafi 's forces . Six rockets landed early on Thursday near the oil refinery and port . A Reuters journalist there reported no casualties . Britain 's military said its Apache helicopters had attacked a government checkpoint and two military vehicles near Khoms , on the Mediterranean coast between Misrata and Tripoli . Insurgents say Gaddafi 's forces are massing and bringing weapons to quell an uprising in Zlitan , the next big town along the road from Misrata to the capital . Rebels inside Zlitan said they mounted a raid on pro-Gaddafi positions on Wednesday night . '' -LRB- We -RRB- carried out a violent attack last night on checkpoints ... and exchanged gunfire , killing a number of soldiers , '' a rebel spokesman , who identified himself as Mabrouk , told Reuters from the town . Le Figaro newspaper said France had parachuted rocket launchers , assault rifles and anti-tank missiles into the Western Mountains in early June . A French military spokesman later confirmed arms had been delivered , although he said anti-tank missiles were not among them . Despite the diplomatic storm , the rebels encouraged more arms deliveries . `` Giving -LRB- us -RRB- weapons we will be able to decide the battle more quickly , so that we can shed as little blood as possible , '' senior rebel figure Mahmoud Jibril said in Vienna . The conflict has halted oil exports from Libya , helping push up world oil prices . Jibril said it may take years for oil exports to fully resume : `` No , no oil is being sold . A lot of the oil well system was destroyed , especially in the east . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Al Quaeda finding a way to get to those weapons ? Is it even relevant ? Do you really think Al Quaeda does n't already have heaps of ways and connection to get weapons ? Plus do n't forget that Gaddafi is a crazy psychopath , what do you think will happen when he feels his end coming ? Do his best to piss the allied force off . by simply giving away weapons to Al Quaeda and other extremist organization because he knows they will eventually use them against the people who helped forcing him out . My point is that it is time to do whatever is needed to kick Gadaffi out , and also maybe stop insinuating that the rebels will give the weapons away to Al Qaeda . Get out of Libya , we have no business there . This is a trumped up war . If we 're so worried about civilian deaths , why are n't we addressing the slaughters that have taken place in gaza ? THe IDF has been killing them routinely , where is NATO on this ? Nato just send in a heat team like the united states did with osama bin laden . Because let 's face it that 's really what you want to do . Stop trying to cover it up with politics or with the guise of we are trying to support the people of libya . You want qaddafi out .

NEAR BIR AL-GHANAM , Libya | Fri Jul 1 , 2011 12:49 am BST NEAR BIR AL-GHANAM , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels gathered on a ridge overlooking a strategic town only 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- from Tripoli on Thursday , preparing for a battle that could allow them to march directly to the seat of Muammar Gaddafi 's power . About 50 rebel fighters spent Thursday at an observation post 2 km outside the town of Bir al-Ghanam , using binoculars to try to assess the position of Gaddafi 's forces . They reached the area on Sunday after fighting in the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli , an area where France said this week it had air-dropped arms , provoking a diplomatic storm among world powers . A French military spokesman confirmed on Thursday a report in Le Figaro that rocket launchers and assault rifles were among arms parachuted in , prompting an angry reaction from Russia , one of many countries who have kept doors open to Gaddafi . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said supplying arms was a `` crude violation '' of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 , which imposed a comprehensive arms embargo in February . Gaddafi 's forces in Bir al-Ghanam know the rebels are watching them from the ridge . At one point on Thursday they fired mortars and artillery , sending people running for cover . The town is just an hour 's drive from Aziziyah on Tripoli 's southern outskirts , and a similar distance from Zawiyah , which controls the coastal highway that links Tripoli to the Tunisian border and the outside world . A trickle of fighters from around the region joined them throughout the day . Some came from Zintan , in the mountains behind them , while others said they had made their way clandestinely from Zawiyah , where Gaddafi 's forces have put down two revolts since February . The rebels encouraged more arms deliveries . `` Giving -LRB- us -RRB- weapons we will be able to decide the battle more quickly , so that we can shed as little blood as possible , '' senior rebel figure Mahmoud Jibril said in Vienna . The rebels advance in the west contrasts with little progress east of Tripoli , increasing frustration among NATO allies over a three-month-old air campaign to back the rebels that has exceeded costs and time-frames originally envisaged . France , Britain and the United States say the air campaign will not end until Gaddafi falls . The war has become the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping North Africa and the Middle East . Paris says it has not violated the U.N. embargo because the weapons it gave the rebels were needed to protect civilians from an imminent attack , which a later resolution seems to endorse . `` We believe that U.N. Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , read together , neither specified nor precluded providing defense materiel to the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . `` We would respectfully disagree with the Russian assessment , '' he added . Nevertheless , the United States had not taken steps to arm the rebels , he said . Rebels acknowledged French support , saying it had helped sustain them in the region . `` There should be no doubt that Libyans in the Nafusa Mountain -LRB- Western Mountains -RRB- area are alive and safe today thanks to a combination of heroic Libyan bravery and French wisdom and support , '' Vice Chairman Abdul Hafeedh Ghoga of the Transitional National Council said in a statement . Libyan television broadcast a statement from tribal leaders condemning French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the arms , calling the rebels in the Berber area `` a product of France . '' But the rebel advance towards Tripoli 's southwest outskirts from the Western Mountains has not been matched by progress towards the capital from the east , where they hold Misrata on the coast about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- from the capital . The city has been bombarded for months by Gaddafi 's forces . Six rockets landed early on Thursday near the oil refinery and port . A Reuters journalist there reported no casualties . Insurgents say Gaddafi 's forces are massing and bringing weapons to quell an uprising in Zlitan , the next big town along the road from Misrata to the capital . Rebels inside Zlitan said they mounted a raid on pro-Gaddafi positions on Wednesday night and killed three men in an army patrol on Thursday morning . France 's weapons airlift , while possibly increasing the insurgent threat to Gaddafi , highlights a dilemma for NATO . More than 90 days into its bombing campaign , Gaddafi is still in power and no breakthrough is in sight , making some NATO members feel they should help the rebels more actively , something the poorly-armed insurgents have encouraged . But if they do that , they risk fracturing the international coalition over how far to go . Russia is not involved in the air campaign , but its stance could add to reservations among some NATO countries over the air war . Moscow could also challenge Paris at the U.N. Security Council , where both are veto-wielding permanent members . U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said it was up to the Security Council to determine what is permitted by its resolutions . Even before news of the French arms supply emerged , fissures were emerging in the coalition over the high cost , civilian casualties and the elusiveness of a military victory . Gaddafi says the NATO campaign is an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing the North African state 's oil . He says NATO 's U.N.-mandated justification for its campaign -- to protect Libyan civilians from attack -- is spurious . The World Bank 's Libya representative said on Thursday Islamist militants could gain ground if the conflict wears on . `` If this civil war goes on , it would be a new Somalia , which I do n't say lightly . In three months we could be dealing with extremists , '' said Marouane Abassi , World Bank country manager for Libya who has been in Tunisia since February . Gaddafi 's daughter Aisha told French 2 television the government was involved in talks with the rebels . `` There are direct and indirect negotiations and we should stop letting Libyan blood , '' she said in an interview aired on Thursday . `` And for that we are ready to ally with the devil and that is the armed rebels .

That 's why time is very important in this conflict , before we face problems in managing it . '' Abassi , who is Tunisian , said the World Bank had been working with Libya since 2006 on plans for economic reforms led by leader Muammar Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam , although many of those reform plans were scuppered by Gaddafi . He described some of the leaders of the rebel Transitional National Council as among those most strongly associated with economic reform plans . '' ... We know them , we did good work with them , '' Abassi said , citing Ali Issawi , a former economy minister and ambassador , and Mahmoud Jebril , who resigned from a state economic think-tank after Gaddafi overruled his suggestions for liberalising the economy . `` These guys tried inside -LRB- Gaddafi 's government -RRB- . In 2009 Gaddafi stopped the connection between us and them , '' said Abassi . Nevertheless , parts of Gaddafi 's government and local councils were still seeking World Bank advice up to February , when pro-democracy protests broke out , he said . `` In the last two years it was a battle between reformists and the old guard . But even the last minister of economy who was against us ... accepted the rules of the game , '' he said . The rebellion , which began with an uprising in February and has been backed by Western air strikes since March , has so far failed to dislodge Gaddafi , raising pressure on Western countries to take more decisive action . France said on Wednesday it had sent arms to the rebels , which some countries believe violates an arms embargo . Gaddafi says the Western intervention is a plot to steal Libya 's oil . Abassi said he left the World Bank 's Tripoli office on February 20 after government forces began suppressing protesters . `` Now we are trying to understand how we can help Libya after the conflict , '' he said . Tunisia , where he is now based , is also suffering financially , losing some $ 200 million a month in remittances and other revenue from Tunisian expatriates who have returned . `` Over 65,000 Tunisians have returned out of 125,000 who were living in Libya . They are like refugees in Tunisia without revenue . Tunisia gave them some cash handouts and we are trying to provide funds and grants , '' Abassi said . `` Over 1.7 million Libyans come each year to Tunisia and for the Tunisian economy it 's very important . They spend a lot of money on health -- maybe 50 percent of the revenue in clinics in the south is from Libyans , '' Abassi said .

NATO warplanes have been bombing Libya under a U.N. mandate , but the alliance is under mounting strain because of the cost of the operation and the failure , after more than three months , to produce a decisive outcome . `` I was against this measure , '' Berlusconi said . `` I had my hands tied by the vote of the parliament of my country . But I was against and I am against this intervention which will end in a way that no-one knows . '' Some of the alliance bombing missions over Libya take off from military airbases in Italy . There was no suggestion following Berlusconi 's comments that Rome would withdraw the use of the bases . But Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa said that the cost to Italy of the Libya operation would fall from 142 million euros in the first half of the year to less than 60 million euros in the second half as part of general defense spending cuts . He said after a cabinet meeting on Thursday the aircraft carrier Garibaldi with three aircraft on board had been withdrawn , and their tasks would be taken on by land-based aircraft . The comments from Rome came just a day after Libyan rebels made a big push toward Tripoli on two fronts . Speaking at a book presentation in Rome , Berlusconi said : `` I went to Paris and I said -- I can repeat this -- I would have stood with Mrs Merkel as far as this decision to intervene in the no fly zone is concerned . '' He appeared to be referring to a March 19 meeting at which several Western powers decided to launch the military intervention . German Chancellor Angela Merkel chose not to involve her country in the operation . `` We posed very precise questions to the protagonists of this initiative -- that 's to say President Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron -- in the most recent meeting of the heads of government in Brussels , '' he said . `` The answer was that the war will end when there is , as we expect , a revolt by the population of Tripoli against the current regime . '' A move to stop funding for President Barack Obama 's military intervention in Libya was narrowly defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives . Both political parties split over the measure , highlighting how tensions over U.S. involvement in Libya 's civil war have crossed party lines and created unusual alliances . Republicans and Democrats argued that President Obama violated the U.S. Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Resolution by failing to secure congressional authorization for U.S. military operations in the north African country . Gaddafi has rejected any suggestion that he will give up power and he has described the NATO campaign as an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libya 's oil . Potentially adding to the pressure on Italy to review its stance on Libya , a senior Libyan government spokesman said negotiations had begun with Russian and Chinese firms to take over the role of Italian energy firm ENI in oil and gas projects . U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Gaddafi -- who has dismissed rebels trying to end his four-decade rule as criminals and vermin -- to listen to the will of the people . `` We are far from reaching an agreement to reach an end to the conflict but the negotiating process is ongoing , '' Ban told reporters in Geneva . `` He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- has to listen much more attentively and seriously what would be the best for the future of the Libyan people . '' Rebel fighters trying to advance toward the capital Tripoli launched offensives on two fronts on Wednesday and made significant gains . But analysts said the advances were not yet enough to shift the military balance against Gaddafi . In the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli , fighters pushed pro-Gaddafi forces out of the village of al-Qawalish , clearing the way for them to try to seize control of the main highway heading north to the capital . Colonel Juma Ibrahim , a rebel commander in the nearby town of Zintan , said seven rebel fighters were killed in the operation and 30 wounded . He said the capture of al-Qawalish meant other villages and towns in the region were no longer in the range of government rockets and artillery . `` It will let the people return to their houses , '' he said . The slow push toward the capital would continue , he said . `` All fronts are quiet . Each side is making preparations for the next round . This is the quiet before the storm . '' A rebel spokesman in Nalut by the border with Tunisia said a rebel tank hit and destroyed a loyalist car carrying weapons north of the rebel-held town . Further north , on Libya 's Mediterranean coast , rebel fighters on Wednesday advanced west from Misrata to within about 13 km of Zlitan -- one of a chain of government-controlled towns blocking their advance to Tripoli . A Reuters reporter near the front line on Thursday said there was now a lull in the fighting , although he could hear a few explosions . Rebels at the front will need more ammunition , a minister with the National Transitional Council said while on a visit to Misrata . `` There is enough to run the front for the time being but we need more , '' Minister of Health Nagi Barakah said at a news conference . Gaddafi 's military capabilities have been severely hurt by the bombing , NATO military spokesman Mike Bracken said . NATO had `` degraded Gaddafi 's military capacity to the point that he is no longer capable of running any major military operation , '' he said . There were also signs Gaddafi may try to turn Friday prayers in Tripoli into a pro-government demonstration . Libyan TV broadcast calls from tribal leaders urging people in the capital to gather at the city 's Green Square for prayers . A post on a Facebook page used by anti-Gaddafi activists said it was possible the authorities would close mosques in the capital to force people to gather in the square . However , anti-Gaddafi rebels received a fresh diplomatic boost when China sent a senior diplomat to meet the rebel leadership in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . The visit by Chen Xiaodong , China 's foreign ministry chief for North African affairs , was the second official meeting between China and Libyan opposition leaders in less than a month . `` China believes that the present situation can not go on and a political resolution to find a way out of the Libyan crisis must be found as soon as possible , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular news briefing in Beijing . There were reports this week that Gaddafi -- under pressure from the five-month-old uprising against his rule , sanctions and the NATO bombing campaign -- was seeking a deal under which he would step down . His government has denied any such negotiations are underway , and NATO 's chief said he had no confirmation that Gaddafi was looking for a deal to relinquish power . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . He may have been against the invasion , as I think Italy probably was , but Berlusconi is little more than a rich businessman with a loud mouth . Berlusconi is feeling the pressure from ENI , not China , on the non-advancement of the situation in Libya . But his biggest problem is his coalition 's partner in Government who have given him a deadline to withdraw from the Libya intervention , given public opinion in Italy who was never favourable to this war .

Both political parties split on the measure , highlighting how tensions over U.S. involvement -- in conjunction with NATO -- in Libya 's civil war have crossed party lines and created unusual alliances . Republicans and Democrats argued that President Obama violated the U.S. Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Resolution by failing to secure congressional authorization for U.S. military operations in the north African country . The House did vote , 225-201 , to bar any money in the defense spending bill from being spent on military equipment or training for Libyan rebels . The measure also would have to get Senate approval and be signed by Obama before becoming law . Representative Tom Cole , who sponsored the measure , called it a `` very important moment . '' `` It 's extraordinarily important that we stop the erosion of the war-making authority of the Congress of the United States , that we end this ill-advised adventure in Libya and that we reassert the rightful place of this institution in conducting war , authorizing it and funding it , '' he said . Senator John McCain , a fellow Republican , acknowledged frustration over Obama 's lack of consultation with Congress over the conflict but said the vote to bar funding for `` freedom fighters in Libya is deeply disturbing . '' `` This action sends the wrong message to both -LRB- Libyan leader Muammar -RRB- Gaddafi and those fighting for freedom and democracy in Libya -- especially with Gaddafi is clearly crumbling , '' McCain said . The House , in a 316-111 vote , also approved a measure barring the Pentagon from using funds from the 2012 defense spending bill on anything that violates the War Powers Resolution , which requires the president to seek congressional approval within 60 days of committing U.S. forces to a conflict . SPONSORED BY MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES On a vote of 199-229 , the House rejected the proposal to block defense funds in fiscal year 2012 , which begins October 1 , for U.S. military participation in the NATO-led mission against Gaddafi 's forces . The failed measure 's sponsors were Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich and Republican Representative Justin Amash . `` We are at war , '' Amash argued before the vote . `` The Constitution vests Congress with the exclusive power to declare war . '' He said it was embarrassing to hear the Obama administration 's `` flimsy '' arguments for being involved in Libya but it would be even more embarrassing if Congress did nothing about its constitutional role being ignored . `` We must stand up and say stop . '' But Representative Norm Dicks , a Democrat , said it would be wrong to undermine the president , as well as NATO allies involved in the war , by cutting off funds for it . He said the administration estimated the conflict would cost the United States a little more than $ 1 billion by September 30 . Representative Bill Young , a Republican , said there were no funds in the fiscal 2012 defense spending bill for Libya anyway , because the administration had said that it was taking the money from the `` base budget '' that had already been appropriated in the current fiscal year . The House has held several votes on the Libyan operation . Last month it defeated another move to curb the intervention , while also refusing to formally authorize the U.S. participation . The Senate has yet to take any votes on the war , although a resolution to authorize the U.S. role has passed a committee . The House actions reflect growing war fatigue among lawmakers after almost a decade of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq that have cost more than $ 1 trillion and have helped fuel a $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit . The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission against Libya more than three months ago , aiming to prevent Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians in regions opposed to his rule . The mission now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power .

Rebel fighters in western Libya faced sustained artillery and rocket bombardment by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi for the fifth straight day on Saturday . TRIPOLI | Sun Jul 10 , 2011 7:13 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A French minister said on Sunday it was time for Libya 's rebels to negotiate with Muammar Gaddafi 's government , but Washington said it stood firm in its belief that the Libyan leader can not stay in power . The diverging messages from two leading members of the Western coalition opposing Gaddafi hinted at the strain the alliance is under after more than three months of air strikes that have cost billions of dollars and failed to produce the swift outcome its backers had expected . French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet signaled growing impatience with the progress of the conflict when he said the rebels should negotiate now with Gaddafi 's government and not wait for his defeat . The rebels have so far refused to hold talks as long as Gaddafi is still in power , a stance which before now none of NATO 's major powers has publicly challenged . `` We have ... have asked them to speak to each other , '' Longuet , whose government has until now been among the most hawkish on Libya , said on French television station BFM TV . `` The position of the TNC -LRB- rebel Transitional National Council -RRB- is very far from other positions . Now , there will be a need to sit around a table , '' he said . '' Asked if it was possible to hold talks if Gaddafi had not stepped down , Longuet said : `` He will be in another room in his palace with another title . '' Soon after , the State Department in Washington issued a message that gave no hint of compromise . `` The Libyan people will be the ones to decide how this transition takes place , but we stand firm in our belief that Gaddafi can not remain in power , '' the department said in a written reply to a query . It also said the United States would continue efforts , as part of the NATO coalition , to protect civilians from attack and said it believed the alliance was helping ratchet up the pressure on Gaddafi . Gaddafi has been defiantly holding on to power in the face of rebel attacks trying to break his 41-year rule , NATO air strikes , economic sanctions and the defections of prominent members of his government . With no imminent end to the conflict in sight , cracks are emerging inside the NATO alliance . Some member states are balking at the burden on their recession-hit finances , and many are frustrated that there has been no decisive breakthrough . But even countries which support a political solution have not answered the question of how a deal can be hammered out when the rebels and their Western backers say Gaddafi must go while the Libyan leader himself says that is not up for negotiation . Strains over how to proceed in Libya are likely to surface on Friday when the contact group , which brings together the countries allied against Gaddafi , gathers in Istanbul for its next scheduled meeting . There was no immediate reaction to the French minister 's comments from the rebel leadership at its headquarters in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . On the ground , rebel forces trying to march on Tripoli have made modest gains in the past week , but the fighting on Sunday underlined it would a long slog . Gaddafi 's forces launched a heavy artillery bombardment to try to push back rebel fighters who last week seized the village of Al-Qawalish , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli . Al-Qawalish is a strategic battleground because if the rebels manage to advance beyond it they will reach the main highway leading north into the capital Tripoli . A rebel fighter in the village , Amignas Shagruni , told Reuters that shells had been landing repeatedly over the past 24 hours from pro-Gaddafi forces positioned a few kilometres to the east . But he said : `` No one was hurt , thank God . '' During a 20-minute period while Reuters visited the frontline east of Al-Qawalish , at least five shells landed . However , they did not appear to be well targeted , striking random spots in the nearby hills . Libya has been convulsed by a civil war since February when thousands of people , inspired by revolutions in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia , rose up against his 41-year-rule . That rebellion has now turned into the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping the region . Gaddafi sounded a new note of defiance on Friday . In an audio recording broadcast on state television , he threatened to export the war to Europe in revenge for the NATO-led military campaign against him . `` Hundreds of Libyans will martyr in Europe . I told you it is eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth , '' he said . `` You will regret it , NATO , when the war moves to Europe . '' Hundreds of kilometres to the northeast of Al-Qawalish , another force of rebels is also trying to push toward Tripoli , though they too are facing tough resistance . Fighters from the rebel-held city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have fought their way west to the outskirts of Zlitan , the first in a chain of coastal towns blocking their progress toward the capital . A spokesman for insurgents who are behind the pro-Gaddafi lines and inside Zlitan itself , said they had mounted their second attack on government troops in a week . `` The revolutionaries inside the town of Zlitan shelled the -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- brigades positioned on the coastal road on Sunday at 1:00 a.m. -LRB- 2300 GMT -RRB- , killing at least seven people , '' a rebel spokesman , who identified himself as Mabrouk , told Reuters from Zlitan . The account could not be verified independently because journalists have not been able to reach the town . NATO launched its bombing campaign in March after the U.N. Security Council authorised the use of all necessary means to protect civilians who rose up against Gaddafi . Gaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants . He has called the NATO operation an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libyan oil . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Hey rebels you should never have trusted the old colonial powers . They just wanted to stop the flow of oil to get the price up for the real powers which is the big money that owns the oil of the world . You should have expected that the french would get you killed in large numbers and do nothing for you . US position is simply for Obama to save face . His unwise , untimely call for regime change inserted the USA into the domestic politics of Libya ... for no reason . Libya 's government if for Libyans to determine , not Barak H. Obama ! They were the very first to help the Libyan citizens fighting for their very lives and family members when Kadhafi began slaughtering them . Now that the Libyan citizens are on the offensive , the French tell the Libyan citizens to make peace with Khadafi . The French politicians should put themselves in the mental shoes of those Libyans that have lost mothers , fathers , brothers , sisters , neighbors , and friends because Kadhafi the `` King of Kings , '' declared war on his own citizens . Justice for the Libyan citizens will not be achieved until Kadhafi and his Nazi goons are dead or imprisoned for life . This discussion is now closed .

The indigenous people of north Africa , known to others as Berbers and among themselves as Amazigh , were brutally suppressed under Gaddafi , who considered the teaching of their language and culture to be a form of imperialism in his Arab country . They have become crucial supporters of the rebellion seeking to topple Gaddafi , with their stronghold in the Nafusa Mountains southwest of Tripoli emerging as one of the main fronts . Berber was the main language of North Africa before Arabic arrived with the Muslim conquest in the 7th century . It is still spoken in the Sahara and in mountainous parts of Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia as well as Libya . Activists say most of the Arabs of North Africa are in fact descended from Amazigh peoples who were there before the arrival of Islam . Today , the rebel-held town of Jadu , normally home to about 20,000 people but now swollen with refugees from areas within shelling range of Gaddafi 's troops , has become the center for the rebirth of Amazigh culture and language . Shops have painted Amazigh signs above their doors . For a few weeks , a radio station has been broadcasting from here in both Arabic and Amazigh , in what Berber activists believe are the first conversations in their language over Libyan airwaves in four decades . An Amazigh publishing house has printed four books so far over the past month , billed as Libya 's first publications in the language since Gaddafi seized power . And there is Mira 's school , where classes are held six evenings a week from 5:30 to 7:30 pm . The children study the Amazigh language at basic and advanced levels , as well as English , and sing songs in the courtyard . Their teachers learned Amazigh in secret from their parents at home . Nearby is a museum , with local artifacts defiantly labeled in the once-banned script , items bearing the distinctive geometric patterns that Berbers say are part of their heritage . Early in his rule , Gaddafi declared that anyone studying the Amazigh language was drinking `` poisoned milk from their mother 's breast , '' explained Fathi Anfusi , a 48-year-old Amazigh activist who escaped Tripoli and arrived in Jadu last month . Gaddafi accused Amazigh activists of being on the payroll of Western intelligence agencies and seeking to divide the country . Berber activists were rounded up and jailed . The hero of their movement , a poet and journalist named Said Mahrooq , was paralyzed after being run down by a car . Even giving children Amazigh names was forbidden . Anfusi , an agronomist by profession , wanted to name his daughter Tala , a Berber name meaning `` fountain . '' He was forced to register her with the Arabic name Hala instead . FRIENDS ... FOR THE REVOLUTION Even the Berber name of the Nafusa mountain range was banned . On Gaddafi 's maps , the region is known only as the Western Mountains . Gaddafi 's government still uses hostility to the Amazigh as part of its propaganda , warning Arabs in nearby towns that Berbers are coming out of the hills to attack them . Inside rebel-held territory , Arabs and Berbers say they are united . Rebel units from Berber towns like Yefren and Jadu have been fighting side by side with units from Arab towns in the mountains , such as Zintan . All fly the same pre-Gaddafi flag and profess similar goals of creating a democratic state . But although they fight side by side , the units are still kept separate . When they captured the village of al-Qawalish last week , one of the first acts of the rival units was to hurriedly spray-paint the names of their Arab or Berber home towns on village walls . An Arab rebel fighter in Zintan winced when this reporter referred to the Nafusa Mountains . `` Never say the Nafusa Mountains . That 's what the Berbers call it . We call it the Western Mountains , '' he said . But are n't you all friends ? . `` We are friends for now , '' the fighter replied , pausing for a moment to consider . `` For the revolution . '' Anfusi acknowledges that hostility between Arabs and Berbers will probably outlast Gaddafi 's time in power . `` We will discover about each other . This will need time . Maybe we need five years . Maybe ten years to build our country . This is our opportunity , '' he said . But in his own way , Gaddafi had inadvertently helped . The Libyan leader 's crackdown on the rebellion this year had united the Arabs and Berbers of the mountains for the first time , Anfusi said . `` The people , they all hate Gaddafi .

Rebel fighters in western Libya faced sustained artillery and rocket bombardment by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi for the fifth straight day on Saturday . TRIPOLI | Mon Jul 11 , 2011 3:32 am BST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - France 's defense minister said it was time for Libya 's rebels to negotiate with Muammar Gaddafi 's government , signalling growing impatience with progress in the conflict . Gaddafi 's son , in an interview with an Algerian newspaper on Monday , said his father 's government was in talks with the French government . There was no immediate comment from Paris . French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said on Sunday the rebels should not wait for Gaddafi 's defeat , while signalling that Paris ' objective was that the Libyan leader must leave power eventually . Washington said it stood firm in its belief Gaddafi must go . The messages from two leading members of the Western coalition opposing Gaddafi hinted at the strain the alliance is under after more than three months of air strikes that have cost billions of dollars and failed to produce the swift outcome its backers had expected . The rebels have refused to hold talks as long as Gaddafi remains in power , a stance which before now none of NATO 's major powers has publicly challenged . `` We have ... asked them to speak to each other , '' Longuet , whose government has until now been among the most hawkish on Libya , said on French television station BFM TV . `` The position of the TNC -LRB- rebel Transitional National Council -RRB- is very far from other positions . Now , there will be a need to sit around a table , '' he said . Asked if it was possible to hold talks if Gaddafi had not stepped down , Longuet said : `` He will be in another room in his palace with another title . '' Soon after , the State Department in Washington issued a message that gave no hint of compromise . `` The Libyan people will be the ones to decide how this transition takes place , but we stand firm in our belief that Gaddafi can not remain in power , '' it said in a written reply to a query . It also said the United States would continue efforts , as part of the NATO coalition , to protect civilians from attack and said it believed the alliance was helping to up the pressure on Gaddafi . In an interview published on Monday by the Algerian El Khabar newspaper , Saif al-Islam , a son of the Libyan leader , said his father 's administration was in talks with the French government . Speaking from Tripoli , the newspaper quoted him as saying : `` The truth is that we are negotiating with France and not with the rebels . `` Our envoy to -LRB- Nicolas -RRB- Sarkozy said that the French president was very clear and told him ` We created the -LRB- rebel -RRB- council , and without our support , and money , and our weapons , the council would have never existed . `` France said : ` When we reach an agreement with you -LRB- Tripoli -RRB- , we will force the council to cease fire ' , '' he was quoted as saying . Gaddafi has been holding on to power in the face of rebel attacks trying to break his 41-year rule , NATO air strikes , economic sanctions and the defections of prominent members of his government . With no imminent end to the conflict in sight , cracks are emerging inside the NATO alliance . Some member states are balking at the burden on their recession-hit finances , and many are frustrated that there has been no decisive breakthrough . But even countries which support a political solution have not answered the question of how a deal can be hammered out when the rebels and their Western backers say Gaddafi must go while the Libyan leader himself says that is not up for negotiation . Strains over how to proceed in Libya are likely to surface on Friday when the contact group , which brings together the countries allied against Gaddafi , gathers in Istanbul for its next scheduled meeting . There was no immediate reaction to the French minister 's comments from the rebel leadership at its headquarters in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . On the ground , rebel forces trying to march on Tripoli have made modest gains in the past week , but the fighting on Sunday underlined it would be a long slog . Gaddafi 's forces launched a heavy artillery bombardment to try to push back rebel fighters who last week seized the village of Al-Qawalish , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli . Al-Qawalish is a strategic battleground because if the rebels manage to advance beyond it they will reach the main highway leading north into the capital Tripoli . A rebel fighter in the village , Amignas Shagruni , told Reuters shells had been landing repeatedly over the past 24 hours from pro-Gaddafi forces positioned a few kilometres to the east . But he said : `` No one was hurt , thank God . '' During a 20-minute period while Reuters visited the frontline east of Al-Qawalish , at least five shells landed . However , they did not appear to be well targeted . Libyan state television reported on Sunday that NATO forces had struck an `` educational institution '' in Tripoli . Jamahiriyah Television quoted a military spokesman as saying there were `` human and material '' casualties in the air strike in the district of Tajoura , but gave no specific details . Libya has been convulsed by a civil war since February when thousands of people , inspired by revolutions in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia , rose up against Gaddafi 's rule . Hundreds of kilometres to the northeast of Al-Qawalish , another force of rebels is trying to push towards Tripoli , though they too are facing tough resistance . Fighters from the rebel-held city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have fought their way west to the outskirts of Zlitan , the first in a chain of coastal towns blocking their progress towards the capital . NATO launched its bombing campaign in March after the U.N. Security Council authorised the use of all necessary means to protect civilians who rose up against Gaddafi . Gaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants . He has called the NATO operation an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libyan oil .

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the EU 's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton are among more than a dozen ministers attending the Libyan contact group meeting , its fourth since an emergency summit in London in March . `` The main aim is to find a political solution to accelerate efforts to end the bloodshed , '' said Selcuk Unal , spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry hosting the talks in Istanbul . Heads of NATO , the Arab League , African Union and Gulf Cooperation Council will also attend along with representatives of the Libyan opposition . The U.N. Secretary-General 's special envoy on Libya , Abdul Elah Al-Khatib , will report results of contacts with the beleaguered Gaddafi government in Tripoli and the rebel National Transitional Council based in the eastern city of Benghazi . There will also be updates on the flow of financial and humanitarian assistance to the rebel-held areas . Russian and China , two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that have taken softer line on Gaddafi , were invited for a first time to attend a contact group meeting . But China has said it would skip the meeting while it was uncertain who Russia would send . Mahmoud Jebril , a senior member of the rebel council , said in Brussels on Wednesday that there had been no negotiations so far with Gaddafi 's regime to end the civil war that began with a popular uprising against his 41-year rule in February . Gaddafi is resisting rebel advances on Tripoli from the eastern desert and western mountains , and the drawn-out conflict and lack of substantive talks have frustrated NATO allies who are helping the rebels by enforcing a no-fly zone and bombing Gaddafi forces deemed a threat to civilians . The international community wants to ensure that the oil - and gas-rich North African country of 6 million people emerges as a stable democracy rather than falling prey to ethnic or tribal conflict , or becoming a haven for Islamist militants . Among items to be discussed in Istanbul will be a recommendation by a British-led team planning post-conflict Libya for Gaddafi 's security forces to be left intact after a rebel victory in order to avoid errors made after the Iraq war . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said earlier this week that emissaries from Gaddafi 's government were in contact with NATO members , and were saying that Gaddafi was ready to quit . A crucial question , should Gaddafi agree to step down , will be whether he is allowed to stay in Libya or has to take refuge in a third country despite a U.N.-backed International Criminal Court investigation into crimes against his people . Clinton said on Wednesday in Washington that Gaddafi 's intentions were unclear . `` We are still getting contradictory signals from Colonel Gaddafi 's camp , '' she said during a visit by Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . `` He has yet to meet the red lines that are set by the international community to cease violence against his people , withdraw his forces and step down from power . '' Clinton said the while the United States and Russia could not predict exactly when Gaddafi would go , `` we do understand and agree that his days are numbered '' . Lavrov said Moscow 's position on the enforcement of U.N. resolutions on Libya differed somewhat from that of NATO powers , but this would not stop Russian efforts to get peace talks going . `` We are united in that we have to start the political process as soon as possible and we have different channels , official and not very official channels , to work through to create conditions for this process , '' he said . The White House later issued a statement that President Barack Obama welcomed Russia 's efforts to mediate a political solution and back talks towards a democratic transition so long as Gaddafi stepped aside . Turkey and the African Union have proposed separate road maps aimed at establishing a cease-fire and moving through stages from Gaddafi quitting power to a democratic transition , and the contact group will seek to agree on a single plan . Turkey 's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has voiced hopes last week that significant progress towards a political solution could be made before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan , which this year falls at the beginning of August .

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Washington would extend formal recognition to the Benghazi-based TNC until a fully representational interim government can be established . `` The TNC has offered important assurances today , including the promise to pursue a process of democratic reform that is inclusive both geographically and politically , '' Clinton said in prepared remarks . `` Until an interim authority is in place , the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya , and we will deal with it on that basis . '' Clinton 's announcement came as the Libya Contact Group , meeting in Istanbul , formally recognized the opposition as the representative of the Libyan people -- sealing its diplomatic status as the successor government to embattled leader Muammar Gaddafi . The contact group , made up of more than 30 governments and international and regional organizations , also authorized U.N. special envoy Abdul Elah Al-Khatib to present terms for Gaddafi to leave power in a political package that will include a ceasefire to halt fighting in the civil war . Clinton said any deal `` must involve Gaddafi 's departure '' from power and a halt to violence . `` Increasingly the people of Libya are looking past Gaddafi . They know , as we all know , that it is no longer a question of whether Gaddafi will leave power , but when , '' she said . U.S. officials said the decision on formal diplomatic recognition marked an important step toward unblocking more than $ 34 billion in Libyan assets in the United States but cautioned it could still take time to get funds flowing to the cash-strapped Benghazi council . `` We expect this step on recognition will enable the TNC to access additional sources of funding , '' Clinton told reporters after the meeting , saying Washington would discuss with allies `` the most effective and appropriate method '' to do this . They also said no decisions had been made on upgrading U.S. representation in Benghazi -- now a small office headed by special envoy Chris Stevens -- or on bringing the TNC into the United Nations and other international organizations . Clinton acknowledged that the United States had `` taken its time '' in deciding on formal recognition of the TNC , but now firmly believed this was the way forward . `` We think they are have made great strides and are on the right path , '' she said . U.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order on February 25 freezing the assets of Gaddafi , his family and top officials , as well as the Libyan government , the country 's central bank and sovereign wealth funds . Most of the frozen assets are liquid in the form of cash and securities . U.S. officials have pledged to free up some of the money for the TNC , which has run dangerously short of cash to pay for salaries and basic services even as it takes on more of the responsibilities of government . But discussions with Congress on mechanisms to free up the money ran into legal complications -- some of which could be swept away by U.S. recognition of the TNC as Libya 's legitimate government . `` Our hope is that in a relatively short time frame we will be able to make progress -LRB- on funds -RRB- but there 's a lot of moving pieces here , '' one senior State Department official said . The United States could direct banks to transfer frozen funds directly to the TNC , but this might still run foul of U.N. financial sanctions in place on Libya . A second option would be for the United States to establish a line of credit backed by the frozen assets as several other countries have done . Clinton 's announcement formally recognizing the TNC marked the end of a process which began in February when Obama declared that Gaddafi had lost his legitimacy as Libya 's leader because of his brutal response to anti-government protesters . `` We wanted to send a very clear signal to Gaddafi and the people around him that we are looking past Gaddafi to a future without him , '' the senior U.S. official said . `` We felt that taking this step today sends that message loud and clear . '' The United States closed its embassy in Tripoli in February and withdrew its diplomatic staff , but maintains embassy staff working in Washington to develop ties with the TNC . The United States and Gaddafi 's government have been estranged for most of the past four decades , and only resumed contacts in 2003 when Tripoli gave up its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and took responsibility for its role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland .

In the latest of a series of speeches apparently designed to show he enjoys support in the areas he controls , Gaddafi described the rebels as worthless traitors and rejected suggestions that he was about to leave the country . `` They said Gaddafi will go to Honolulu , '' he said in a televised speech . `` This is funny : To leave the graves of my forefathers and my people ? Are you serious ? '' His defiance came a day after Western and Arab powers , led by the United States , said the rebel leadership was the legitimate government of Libya . Reports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis . Libyan television also reported what it called an `` enemy attack '' on Tajoura district east of Tripoli early on Sunday , the first such bombing raid by NATO near the capital in several nights , a Reuters witness said . The television said the strike had hit `` civilian and military sites '' but did not specify what they were or mention if there had been any casualties . Brega 's oil resources make it a prize for the rebels , who have been trying to dislodge Gaddafi 's troops in the face of rocket bombardments , according to Al Jazeera television . Most opposition fighters are about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- outside Brega , kept back by Grad rockets fired by government forces , the network reported . The rebels had however captured four government soldiers . In the Western Mountains , where insurgents are trying to push toward Tripoli , heavy fighting erupted on Saturday . Sustained gunfire and volleys of artillery could be heard from the village of Bir Ayad , 15 km -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- south of the front line at the town of Bir Ghanam . Rebels at Bir Ghanam hold the high ground on the outskirts of the town , their closest position to Tripoli , about 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- away . Ahmed , a rebel fighter in Bir Ayad , said a convoy of about 15 vehicles from Gaddafi 's forces tried to approach Bir Ghanam , but the rebels fired at it and the convoy retreated after a about an hour of shooting . `` They were in a column at first but when we started firing they split into groups of three or four vehicles and all of them fled , '' local rebel commander Fathi Alzintani told Reuters . Rebels in the Western Mountains have made progress in recent weeks after repelling assaults by Gaddafi 's forces . Their next goal is Garyan , a town that controls the highway south from Tripoli . But the rebels have been hampered by divisions , ill-discipline and supply problems . In Misrata , the rebels ' main stronghold in the west , six rebel fighters have been killed and four injured in the past 24 hours , hospital staff said . Away from the battlefield , Gaddafi has made a series of audio speeches to coincide with state television broadcasts of rallies attended by thousands of people in Tripoli and elsewhere . As loyalists gathered on the streets of the town of Zawiyah , near the capital , on Saturday , Gaddafi said the rebels were `` apostates '' who had `` become Christians . '' Calling on the rebels to lay down their arms , he said : `` Islam is being humiliated by the cross ... They are burning mosques with bombs . '' `` We have given martyrs , yes ... It 's impossible to compromise or make the slightest concession . '' Crowds were shown firing to the air at the end of the speech . Rebel leaders received a boost in their campaign to oust Gaddafi on Friday when they won recognition as the legitimate government of Libya from the United States and other powers . Western nations said they planned to increase the military pressure on Gaddafi 's forces to make him to give up power after 41 years at the head of the North African state . Recognition of the rebels by the international contact group on Libya is an important diplomatic step that could unlock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . The decision came as reports circulated Gaddafi had sent out emissaries seeking a negotiated end to the conflict , although he remains defiant in public . The contact group also agreed on a road map whereby Gaddafi should relinquish power and put forward plans for Libya 's transition to democracy under the rebel National Transitional Council . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . We 're nothing but war mongers anyway . Maybe God has chosen us for destruction , and with good reason ! Above all , the European Union must start acting like a responsible force in world affairs , not a many-headed monster . The Financial Times published that on February 23 , right as the civil war in Libya erupted . Unfortunately , Europe along with America has continued to act like a many-headed monster , particularly in Libya . To begin with , the West failed to help countries like Libya develop their economies before the war began . In fact , the West promised to help Libya develop its economy after Libya agreed to abandon its nuclear program . But instead of doing that , the West seemed happy to support and encourage organizations intent on overthrowing the existing regime . In particular , Britain supported the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , a terrorist organization linked to Al Qaeda whose objective was to overthrow Gaddafi . In 1996 , British intelligence even hired that organization to assassinate Gaddafi . Britain has connections to several members of LIFG . The founder of LIFG , Norman Benotman , has lived in London since 1995 . While living in London , he met members of Al Qaeda such as Abu Qatada and Mustafa Setmariam Nasar . Before moving to London , he lived in Sudan where he met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri . Britain also has connections to another member of LIFG , Anas al-Liby . He also knew Osama bin Laden . Despite the fact that America believes he had a role in the 1998 African embassy bombings , Britain gave him political asylum and allowed him to live in Manchester until May of 2000 . Interestingly , Libya issued an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden in March of 1998 . At that time , British and American intelligence tried to conceal the origins of the arrest warrant and they minimized the danger of bin Laden . The fact that Britain provided sanctuary to two members of LIFG and the fact the Britain paid LIFG to assassinate Gaddafi suggests strongly that Britain controls the organization . And the fact that British and American intelligence tried to squash an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden suggests they controlled him as well .

The rebels have encircled Brega , an oil export terminal with a refinery which for months marked the eastern limit of Gaddafi 's control , said spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah . But its streets were strewn with landmines , making it hard to secure full control of the area . `` The main body -LRB- of Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- retreated to Ras Lanuf , '' which lies to the west , he said by telephone from the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi . However , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said that , `` our brave soldiers and volunteer soldiers are in Brega in their thousands and control it completely . '' `` NATO and the rebels have tried to attack Brega for the last five days , '' he told foreign journalists in the capital Tripoli . `` The only way for them to control Brega is to attack it with nuclear bombs . '' He said the government had lost 30 soldiers over five days of fighting , but rebels had lost many times more . Abdulmolah said 12 rebels were killed and some 300 wounded on Saturday and Sunday . Most rebel forces were now past Brega and heading west toward the towns of Bishr and Ugayla , he said . While rebel fighters have been making gains in eastern and western Libya in recent days , Russia criticized the United States and other countries for recognizing the rebel leadership as the legitimate government of Libya , saying they were taking sides in the insurgents ' five-month-old war to oust Gaddafi . `` Those who declare recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced U.S. recognition of the rebels on Friday , a major diplomatic step that could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . Russia and China have taken a softer line toward Libyan leader Gaddafi , and neither attended an international meeting on the conflict in Turkey on Friday . Brega , about 750 km -LRB- 465 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , has a strategic oil terminal . The attack could signal a new rebel push westwards after weeks of stalemate . It has changed hands several times in the back-and-forth fighting along Libya 's Mediterranean coast since the rebellion began in February . Libyan TV , in a bid to counter the rebel claims , showed what it said was footage taken on Monday in Brega . Students were shown taking an exam , and there were pictures of the port , oil terminal and a worker at a natural gas plant in the city . Rebels say taking Brega will this time be a tipping point in the conflict on the eastern front . `` It is going to take the revolutionaries at least 10 days to claim full control of Brega , '' said rebel spokesman Abdelsalam in Misrata . Gaddafi is refusing to step down despite the five-month-old rebellion against his rule , a campaign of NATO air strikes , and the defections of members of his inner circle . The slow progress of the rebel military campaign has caused strains within NATO , some member states pressing for a negotiated solution to hasten the end of a conflict some thought would last only a few weeks . Reports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis , but on Saturday he called the rebels worthless traitors and rejected the idea he was about to leave the country . NATO said it had on Monday struck an antenna radar system , which was being used for military purposes at Tripoli 's main airport . Naji Daw , acting director of civil aviation at the airport , told journalists the target had purely civilian use . NATO warplanes have also been attacking pro-Gaddafi forces near Brega . The alliance said targets hit on Friday included one tank , five armored fighting vehicles and two rocket launchers . On another front , in the Western Mountains region southwest of Tripoli , pro-Gaddafi forces exchanged artillery fire on Sunday with rebels in the village of Al-Qawalish , a rebel fighter manning a checkpoint there told Reuters . A rebel spokesman in the regional town of Zintan said rebels had repelled a bid by Gaddafi troops to enter the town . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

Setting Russia apart from the West , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said nations that recognized the rebel National Transition Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- were pursuing a `` policy of isolation '' he suggested could undermine efforts to end the five-month war . `` Those who declare such recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war , '' Lavrov said . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the recognition at a meeting in Turkey on Friday of an international contact group on Libya , which is seeking a political solution that would remove Muammar Gaddafi from power . The major diplomatic step could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . Russia , which in the past has warned the contact group not to try to eclipse the authority of the U.N. Security Council , was invited to the meeting for the first time along with China , but both decided not to get involved . Russia has also said Gaddafi must go , but has criticised the Western bombing campaign and urged talks between rebels and the government . Lavrov suggested that recognizing the rebel council as Libya 's sole legitimate government would not help . `` Supporters of such a decision are supporters of a policy of isolation , in this case the isolation of those forces that represent Tripoli , '' said Lavrov , adding that Moscow is in contact with both Tripoli and the rebels . `` We ... reject isolation as a method of solving problems and support inclusion , '' Lavrov said . He said the sides should `` show responsibility for the fate of the people and the country and sit at the negotiating table '' for a `` focused , very concrete dialogue about the conditions under which transitional structures could be formed . '' Those structures would prepare for reforms , legislative changes and `` free and democratic elections , '' he said . Russia , which has veto power and a permanent U.N.

Ineptly deployed , it may even put a brake on the deal-making a resolution will almost certainly require , analysts say . Just how slippery the political track has become for the West emerged on Wednesday , when France , a leading nation in the coalition attacking Gaddafi 's forces , said the Libyan leader could remain in the country if he relinquished power . The idea floated by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will be anathema to many in the rebel opposition who insist Gaddafi not only end his 41-year-old rule but also leave the country . The notion also looks at odds with a Gaddafi arrest warrant issued by The Hague court for crimes against humanity allegedly committed by state forces against civilian demonstrators . Perhaps most starkly of all , Juppe 's remark shows how far Gaddafi 's resilience has diluted Western ambitions five months after the start of an anti-government revolt and four months after NATO began air strikes . Then , back on February 24 , Juppe , echoing the aspirations of officials in many Western states , said : `` I hope wholeheartedly Gaddafi is living his last moments as leader . '' The more modest the West 's expectations , the better the deal Gaddafi may eventually be able to strike . Foreign powers are eager for a rapid end to hostilities , because they want the oil-exporting nation of 6 million to emerge as a stable democracy rather than fall prey to ethnic or tribal conflict , or become a haven for Islamist militants -- both outcomes a prolonged conflict might produce . But the remarks by Juppe , the first senior Western official to express the Gaddafi-can-stay option in such a direct manner , will `` give great comfort '' to the leader , said Jon Marks , a veteran Libya watcher and chairman of Cross Border Information , a UK-based consultancy . It would encourage the Colonel in a belief that he can widen rifts within the international community by stringing out talks with Western powers on a potential exit strategy , he said . Opposition activist and journalist Ashour Shamis said it was impossible to imagine Gaddafi , a proven survivor who ruled for years under sanctions , remaining in Libya in retirement `` keeping quiet and not making trouble . '' `` In his mind he is Libya and therefore has the natural right to intervene . So this idea of Gaddafi staying in the country undermines the whole project -LRB- or reaching a workable solution -RRB- . '' `` It will create more problems than it solves . '' Western officials have said they are receiving continual approaches by Libyan officials expressing contradictory messages on how to bring peace to the country . Some indicate a willingness to step down and help with transitional elections . But on the record , Gaddafi appears defiant . Earlier this month he even threatened to take the war to Europe . His foreign minister , Abdelati Obeidi , said on Wednesday that the government was not in any discussions about Gaddafi 's potential departure from power . As a result of the mixed messages , no one appears sure whether Gaddafi intends to fight in hope of keeping his grip on the territory around Tripoli or seek an exit strategy that guarantees security for himself and his family . Gaddafi is under huge pressure from dwindling fuel supplies and a broadening network of diplomatic acceptance of the rebels , notably Washington 's July 15 recognition of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council as Libya 's government . `` The colonel 's best hope of survival is for a large-scale fallout between NATO members and a scaling back or cessation of air strikes , '' a briefing by risk analysis firm Maplecroft said . `` This , however , is unlikely to occur in the near term . As such , the noose continues to tighten around Gaddafi . '' But Oliver Miles , a former British ambassador to Libya , said behind-the-scenes contacts had clearly not clinched agreement about Gaddafi 's evident desire to stay in Libya . `` There 's no real indication that that difference has been bridged yet . '' Some analysts say Gaddafi is not likely to embrace the notion of asylum in a third country , even if the U.N. Security Council voted to give him immunity from prosecution . Uppermost in the minds of Gaddafi 's aides , Miles said , was the case of former Liberian President Charles Taylor , who was arrested in March 2006 for crimes committed in Sierra Leone 's 1991-2002 civil war . Taylor was in exile in Nigeria from 2003 until March 2006 , when he briefly disappeared before Nigerian police arrested him at a remote border post as he tried to flee into Cameroon . `` The version of the Charles Taylor story that seems to be believed in Libya is that he was given assurances of asylum by the Nigerians and they welshed on this and handed him over to the court , '' Miles said . `` That must be in anyone 's mind if they are thinking in terms of asylum in Africa .

Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said that senior Libyan officials had a `` productive dialogue ' with U.S. counterparts last week in a rare meeting that followed the Obama administration 's recognition of the rebel government that hopes to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . `` We believe other meetings in the future ... will help solve Libyan problems , '' Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on Friday . `` We are willing to talk to the Americans more . '' As Gaddafi clings to power despite five months of civil conflict and a lengthening NATO bombing campaign , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement to the Libyan conflict . While the United States , NATO 's dominant military power , is hoping that talks can gain traction , it along with the rebels that now control roughly half of Libya insists Gaddafi must go . Ibrahim said Libyan officials but not Gaddafi himself would be willing to hold further meetings with rebels . But such talks will only take place on the government 's terms , he said , as it urges them to put down their arms and rejoin the Gaddafi camp . `` Nations do not negotiate with armed gangs , '' Ibrahim said . Gaddafi is urging Libyans , however , to persuade rebels to disarm and to fight them if they do n't . The comments came as the Libya reported a NATO airstrike near the eastern oil hub of Brega , the scene of recent fighting , which the government said killed six guards at a water pipeline plant . The report could not be immediately verified . As Western nations intensify diplomatic efforts to foster an exit from the conflict , a European diplomat said that a U.N. envoy will seek to persuade warring parties in Libya to accept a plan that envisages a ceasefire and a power-sharing government , but with no role for Gaddafi . The diplomat said the informal proposals would be canvassed by the special U.N. envoy to Libya , Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who has met both government and rebels several times . Khatib , a Jordanian senator , told Reuters in Amman he hoped both sides would accept his ideas . `` The U.N. is exerting very serious efforts to create a political process that has two pillars ; one is an agreement on a ceasefire and simultaneously an agreement on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period , '' he said . He did not go into the details of that mechanism . Poorly armed rebels seem unlikely on the cusp of the Islamic holy month to quickly unseat Gaddafi , who came to power himself as a young revolutionary influenced by Egypt 's Gamal Abdel-Nasser . The rebels declared advances this week but they also suffered losses near their stronghold of Misrata and in fighting for Brega . On Thursday rebels said minefields slowed their advance on Brega -- which they had earlier claimed to have all but captured -- but that they had pushed closer to Zlitan , on the Mediterranean coast 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . A rebel spokesman near Zlitan called urgently for help for people in nearby Souk al-Thulatha who joined the rebels but were now besieged by government forces . `` This is very dangerous for the course of the revolution , '' he wrote in an online posting . Gaddafi has stepped up his defiant rhetoric amid persistent reports of talks . Pro-government rallies are being shown almost daily on state television , perhaps a reminder to outsiders that he can still command considerable support . On Friday , thousands of people gathered near Tripoli 's historic center to watch the unveiling of a massive likeness of the longtime leader . State television said Gaddafi would make another speech on Saturday , this time addressed to Egyptians on the anniversary of their revolution -- not this year 's , which toppled President Hosni Mubarak , but pan-Arabist Nasser 's in 1959 . Despite facing a rebel challenge and ostracized by much of the international community , the government remained potent , Ibrahim said . `` NATO , you are losing , you will lose , '' he said . `` The armed gangs in the western mountains and the east part of the country , you have no future -LRB- in the country -RRB- . Ibrahim also denied a report from rebel foreign spokesman Ali Essawi that Mansour Daw , a key aide to Gaddafi , had been wounded in a rebel rocket attack on a meeting of Gaddafi 's inner circle in Tripoli on Thursday . Ibrahim said there had been an explosion caused by a kitchen gas cylinder . Hopes for a negotiated settlement are growing as Europe and the United States grapple with fiscal crises at home . This week , France said for the first time that Gaddafi could stay in Libya as long as he gives up power . But there is little evidence in Libya that either side is ready to make serious concessions . `` The first principle for Libyans is that Gaddafi should step down , and announce this and make this very clear . After that , we can talk about details , '' Essawi told reporters in Rome . `` Negotiations will be only on the departure of Gaddafi . We will not negotiate on his staying in Libya or ruling the Libyans . '' Ibrahim meanwhile reiterated that Gaddafi would not leave his position nor leave Libya on demands from rebels or from Complicating Gaddafi 's situation is the fact that the world court in The Hague which seeks his arrest over crimes against humanity allegedly committed by his forces , he added . As the war in Libya drags on , the U.S. military is weighing options that may deepen its involvement in the conflict and its alliance with the rebels .

With a diplomatic push to end the conflict gathering steam , Abdul Elah al-Khatib told Reuters after the meeting that he would head to Tripoli on Tuesday to canvass government views . `` We did not put a plan in front of them . We discussed the views and ideas on how we can trigger a political process ... to achieve a political solution , '' he said . Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is clinging to power despite a four-month-old NATO air campaign and five months of fighting with rebels who have seized large swathes of the oil-rich North African country . NATO has continued to hammer Gaddafi 's forces around Libya , striking twice in central Tripoli on Monday , and Britain has said there would be no let-up during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in August . But hopes have grown for a negotiated end to a war that has dragged on longer than many initially expected . Speaking to Reuters after meeting Khatib , senior rebel official Mahmoud Jibreel said he had made it clear that the rebels would not accept any initiative that did not involve the removal of Gaddafi from power as a first step to peace . That appears to be a tacit rejection of U.N. ideas floated informally by a diplomat last week , which envisaged a ceasefire followed by a power-sharing government without Gaddafi . Khatib , a Jordanian politician , has said his ideas involve an agreement on a ceasefire and , simultaneously , on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period . He gave no details . `` So far , there is no initiative . He is trying to propose some general ideas , see what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , and on the basis of that he can propose an initiative , '' Jibreel said . `` We are not committed to anything unless we have something written . '' Khatib 's visit comes a day after Gaddafi 's Foreign Minister , Abdelati Obeidi , ended three days of talks in regional power Egypt to seek a negotiated end to the war . Libya 's government has said its representatives are ready to hold more talks with the United States and the rebels , but that Gaddafi himself will not negotiate and will not quit . Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said on Friday senior Libyan officials had a `` productive dialogue '' with U.S. counterparts earlier this month in a rare meeting that followed U.S. recognition of the rebel government . Complicating Gaddafi 's situation is the fact that the world court in The Hague is seeking his arrest for crimes against humanity allegedly committed by his forces . This makes it difficult for him to find refuge outside the country . Hopes for a negotiated settlement have grown , however , since France said for the first time last week that Gaddafi could stay in Libya as long as he gives up power . The rebel leaders have given conflicting signals in recent weeks over whether they would allow Gaddafi and his family to stay in Libya as part of a deal , providing he gave up power . In the latest comment on the issue , opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told the Wall Street Journal that it would be acceptable . `` Gaddafi can stay in Libya but it will have conditions , '' he said . `` We will decide where he stays and who watches him . The same conditions will apply to his family . '' The poorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi . Rebels announced they had almost taken the oil town of Brega , but later said that minefields had slowed their advance . Libyan state TV showed images of empty streets and oil storage facilities in Brega that it said were filmed on Monday . Rebels fighting on a western front near Misrata say they have pushed closer to Zlitan , on the Mediterranean coast 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . But the front near Zlitan was relatively quiet on Monday . Twenty casualties were taken to hospital in Misrata and to a field hospital , but doctors said most had only light wounds . Tripoli-based journalists were taken to Zlitan to see what officials said were some food warehouses and a clinic that were hit by NATO forces . The officials said seven bodies had been recovered from what they said was the destroyed clinic , where blankets and oxygen tanks but no beds could be seen . Britain said its warplanes near Zlitan hit four buildings on Saturday , which NATO surveillance had identified as command and control centers , staging posts and an ammunition stockpile . `` We have no evidence suggesting that these allegations are founded , '' a NATO official told Reuters on Monday when asked about the casualty claim . Rebels near Zlitan said in an online posting that the facilities had once served civilian uses -- two medical centers , a food store and a public bath -- but had been turned into military bases by Gaddafi forces . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . UN is so useless and has been manipulated . The whole fiasco is to GRAB oil and Exploit libya . The original intentions were abandoned and now all the want is a puppet regime in Libya . SHAME SHAME on Europe and USA for manipualting the UN and AFRICA slept again and the colonization has returned .

Libya 's civil war has damaged oil infrastructure and severely hampered the rebel government 's ability to produce and sell oil , increasing its reliance on foreign aid to pay for imports of refined products . Turkish Petroleum International Company -LRB- TPIC -RRB- , a subsidiary of Turkey 's state-owned oil and gas exploration company Turkiye Petrolleri -LRB- TPAO -RRB- , has shipped two fuel cargoes worth at least $ 10 million , an industry source familiar with the deal said . The first tanker , the Sentosa Island , arrived in Benghazi late last week , carrying about 5,000 tonnes of diesel , trade sources said . A second cargo , also carrying around 5,000 tonnes of diesel from Turkey was being delivered , the source said . Regular fuel supplies such as gasoline for cars and diesel used for power plants are vital to the rebels to win the war and retain popular support in a country long-accustomed to subsidised energy . A second industry source said the Turkish government was seeking to line up more suppliers and that he expected one or two more cargoes to be sent . `` The Turks are pushing for more supplies , '' he said . The supply deal is a sign of closer ties between Benghazi and Ankara , which recognized the rebel Transitional National Council earlier this month and pledged $ 200 million in aid . It was not clear whether funding for these fuel deliveries was included in this sum , but the trade sources said that the fuel was being delivered for humanitarian reasons , with no payment expected . A spokesman at the Turkish foreign ministry could not immediately be reached for comment . `` TPIC is considering sending some more fuel on top of these two cargoes . But after that , whether or not these shipments will continue will be up to the Turkish government , '' the first source said . FUEL LIFELINE Oil firm Vitol has until now been the rebels ' main trading partner and has regularly shipped cargoes of oil products , but the oil minister said last month they have had to request payment extensions . Qatar has also supplied fuel to the rebel government . `` It 's not that the Vitol deal is insufficient -- this is free , '' said a Libyan oil industry source , working with the rebels . Other oil traders active in the Mediterranean told Reuters they were interested in supplying Libya but that banks were still blocking payments to the TNC due to sanctions . An oil ministry source said last week that the rebels were looking for an alternative supplier and that at least one other oil firm said it was in talks with them in an early sign that the Libyan oil trade may be picking up . Exact import requirements are unclear , but an industry source with knowledge of the Libyan market said they were around 50,000 tonnes a week . West Libya is also suffering from fuel shortages as international sanctions and NATO cargo interceptions have deterred traders from delivering via tankers . Instead , smugglers are importing fuels overland from Algeria and Tunisia .

U.N. envoy Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who visited the rebels in Benghazi on Monday , is looking for a `` political process '' that will end a war that has failed to dislodge Gaddafi despite months of rebel attacks backed by NATO bombing raids . France and other Western members of the anti-Gaddafi coalition have signalled that the Libyan leader could stay in the country provided he and his circle agree to step down . A rebel leader this week appeared to endorse this view , which would mark a major shift in policy as previous demands have insisted that Gaddafi must leave the country . Deadlines are approaching for the NATO-led alliance , whose mandate for military action expires on September 27 . Hopes have also been expressed that some agreement could be reached before the holy month of Ramadan begins at the start of August . Britain and France , two of the main backers of the campaign to end Gaddafi 's four decades in charge of the North African oil-producing nation , held talks in London at which they called once more for Gaddafi to leave power . British Foreign Secretary William Hague and his French counterpart Alain Juppe also said that it was up to the Libyan people to decide their own future . British officials said there had been no change of policy direction , but the comments were interpreted as tacit backing for the proposal that Gaddafi can remain in Libya after quitting . `` Gaddafi must leave power , '' Hague told reporters on Monday evening . `` The best way of showing the Libyan people they need no longer be in fear of Gaddafi would be for him to leave Libya . `` So that very much remains our position , but it 's also very clear that whatever is settled is a settlement which the Libyan people are happy with . It 's for them to determine their future , not for those outside to try to lay down that future . '' Juppe , who has already endorsed the idea of Gaddafi remaining in Libya after leaving power , added : `` As far as we are concerned , Gaddafi should renounce any kind of power in Libya and he must commit himself to not play any kind of role . '' `` Gaddafi is going to have to abandon power and then it will be for the Libyan people to decide what their future will be , '' Juppe said . Gaddafi has supported talks with the rebels and with the West . But while he has made clear he backs the idea of his remaining in Libya , he has shown no sign in public of agreeing to the other part of the deal -- stepping down from power . While rebel forces have been unable to move decisively against Gaddafi , they have accused neighbouring Algeria of bolstering his troops by turning a blind eye to an arms shipment . Algeria denied it had allowed the weapons to be offloaded at an Algerian port . In his talks with the Benghazi-based rebel leadership council , Khatib , the U.N. envoy , discussed ideas for ending the war but said a firm initiative had yet to take shape . With a diplomatic push to end the conflict gathering steam , Khatib told Reuters he would canvass government views in Tripoli on Tuesday . `` We did not put a plan in front of them . We discussed the views and ideas on how we can trigger a political process ... to achieve a political solution , '' he said . Libyan officials said they expected the Tripoli talks , with senior Gaddafi aides , would cover peace negotiations . But they also wanted to focus on civilian casualties and a desire to urge NATO to stop its air strikes . NATO has continued to hammer Gaddafi forces around Libya , striking twice in central Tripoli on Monday , and Britain has said there would be no let-up during Ramadan . But hopes have grown for a negotiated end to a war that has dragged on longer than many initially expected . Speaking to Reuters after meeting Khatib , senior rebel official Mahmoud Jibril said he had underlined that the rebels would not accept any initiative that did not involve the removal of Gaddafi from power as a first step to peace . Khatib , a senior Jordanian politician , has said his ideas involve an agreement on a cease-fire and , simultaneously , on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period . He has not given details . `` So far , there is no initiative . He is trying to propose some general ideas , see what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , and on the basis of that he can propose an initiative , '' Jibreel said . The rebel leaders have given conflicting signals in recent weeks over whether they would allow Gaddafi and his family to stay in Libya as part of a deal , providing he gave up power . In the latest comment on the issue , opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told the Wall Street Journal that it would be acceptable . `` Gaddafi can stay in Libya but it will have conditions , '' he said . `` We will decide where he stays and who watches him . The same conditions will apply to his family . '' The poorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi . Rebels announced they had almost taken the oil town of Brega , but later said that minefields had slowed their advance . While rebels in the east received a boost this week when Turkey delivered its first cargo of fuel under a multi-million dollar supply deal , a government rocket attack has cut fuel supplies in the frontline western town of Misrata . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . He has fought the rebels and NATO to a standstill . He has effectively won . NATO will , in a few months , make some kind of excuse for leaving Libya , and then Gaddafi 's army will move in decisively on the rebels and finish them off . Thousands will be executed and Gaddafi will go down in history as the man who beat us all . This discussion is now closed .

Britain , one of the main foreign players in the campaign to oust Gaddafi , also expelled his diplomats from London and invited the rebel National Transitional Council to replace them . Gaddafi has scoffed at the efforts to end his 41-year-rule and has weathered a now-stalled rebel advance and NATO air raids on his forces and military infrastructure . France and Britain earlier this week dropped their insistence that he must leave the country as part of any settlement , a softening of position that indicated a growing anxiety to end a conflict that has now lasted five months . However , rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said on Wednesday the NTC had offered a month ago to allow Gaddafi to stay in Libya provided he step down first but that this offer had now expired . `` This offer is no longer valid , '' Abdel Jalil told reporters in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi . The proposal was made about a month ago through U.N. envoy Abdel Elah al-Khatib with a two-week deadline attached , he said . The two weeks had passed . British Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that Britain now recognized the rebels as Libya 's legitimate government and unblocked 91 million pounds in frozen assets . `` This decision reflects the National Transitional Council 's increasing legitimacy , competence and success in reaching out to Libyans across the country , '' Hague said in London . It also invited the opposition to replace diplomats of Gaddafi 's government , who have been expelled from London . The United States and about 30 other nations have also recognized the opposition , potentially freeing up billions of dollars in frozen funds . Russia has criticized such moves , accusing nations of taking sides in a civil war . The rebels have long called on foreign governments to give them access to Libyan assets frozen abroad so they can cover the daily costs of running the east of the country , which they now control . They won $ 1.1 billion at a donor conference in June and received a further boost this week when Turkey dispatched the first cargo of fuel in a multi-million dollar supply deal . But their fighters remain poorly armed and often disorganized . Despite four months of NATO air strikes on pro-Gaddafi forces , the rebels have failed to make big gains toward Tripoli and appear unlikely to make a breakthrough before the start in early August of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . Nor has flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks yielded results . U.N. envoy Khatib visited both sides this week to no avail . There had also been speculation that talk of allowing Gaddafi to remain in Libya might pave the way for the International Criminal Court to reconsider the charges of crimes against humanity leveled against him , his son and intelligence chief . But the ICC said `` justice must be done '' irrespective of any political agreement . ICC official Fadi el-Abdallah said warrants of arrest have already been issued against Gaddafi , Saif al-Islam , his son , and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi . `` A political agreement does not affect the legal obligations or the judicial process . Justice must be done , in accordance with the rules of the Rome Statute -LRB- the ICC 's founding treaty -RRB- , '' el-Abdallah said . The United Nations said late on Tuesday that the two sides remained far apart on finding a political solution , a verdict underlined by Gaddafi 's camp calling for an end to air strikes before any talks can begin .

With hopes fading of a negotiated settlement , both sides appear prepared for the five-month-old war to grind on into the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in August . The rebels said they were planning to attack the town of Ghezaia near the Tunisian border in the next 48 hours , and a Reuters correspondent saw dozens of heavily armed pickup trucks heading for the nearby rebel-held town of Nalut . `` We are reinforcing the position around Nalut and we will attack Ghezaia tomorrow or the next day for sure . We plan to take it , '' Omar Fakkan , a rebel commander , told Reuters . He said that forces from a number of rebel-held towns in the Nafusa Mountains were gathering in Nalut , ready for the attack . Rebel fighters have taken large swathes of Libya since the start of an uprising to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule , and now control much of the Nafusa mountain range , the northeast of Libya and the western city of Misrata . Yet they remain poorly armed and are often disorganized . Despite four months of NATO strikes , they have failed to reach the capital Tripoli and appear unlikely to make a breakthrough soon . Gaddafi has scoffed at the efforts to end his rule and has weathered the now-stalled rebel advance and the NATO air raids on his forces and military infrastructure . A recent flurry of diplomatic activity has yielded little , with the rebels insisting Gaddafi step down as a first step and his government saying his role is non-negotiable . United Nations envoy Abdel Elah al-Khatib visited both sides this week with plans for a ceasefire and a power-sharing government that excludes Gaddafi , but to no avail . Asked about Khatib 's proposal , rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said : `` We were surprised the day before yesterday that we are taking 10 steps back ... and he says to share power with Muammar Gaddafi 's regime . This is laughable . '' Gaddafi also appeared defiant on Wednesday , urging rebels to lay down their arms or suffer an ugly death . `` We all lead this battle , until victory , until martyrdom , '' he said in an audio message aired at a pro-Gaddafi rally in Zaltan , 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- west of his stronghold Tripoli . Ramping up pressure on Gaddafi , Britain expelled his diplomats from London on Wednesday and invited the rebel National Transitional Council to replace them .

However , the British move won praise from rebels fighting in the western mountains . `` We are encouraged by what Britain has done and there is no way Gaddafi can stay in Libya , '' said Fakkan . `` The fighting will get much worse now because he will have to fight to survive and the Libyans do not want him .

The ship can carry up to 1 million barrels but was only partially loaded . The oil was from storage tanks rather than being fresh barrels from oilfields , the sources said . `` The cargo is the second export from the rebels and it may be the last before Libyan production restarts , '' one source said . Oilfields in eastern Libya have been unable to pump due to the escalating civil war as rebels have sought to oust the government of Muammar Gaddafi since February . In April , Vitol lifted a cargo of crude oil and delivered it to Hawaii .

Italian refiner Saras has the only oil refinery in Sardinia . Saras declined to comment . A Vitol spokesman and shipowner Athenian Sea Carriers also declined to comment .

BENGHAZI , Libya | Fri Jul 29 , 2011 6:58 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels said on Friday the gunmen who shot dead the rebel military chief were fighters of an allied militia , in apparent confirmation of deep rifts among the forces struggling to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi . The reports follow 24 hours of confusion over the killing of Abdel Fattah Younes , a defector from Gaddafi 's inner circle , whose death deals a blow both to the rebels and their Western backers . There had been widespread speculation as to whether Younes had been killed in an internal rebel feud or by Gaddafi forces which had penetrated the Benghazi-based movement . The killing of such a senior figure was a setback for the rebels as they were winning broader international recognition and launching an offensive in the west , and has deepened fears that divisions within the rebel camp will prolong the conflict . Rebel minister Ali Tarhouni told reporters in Benghazi that an allied militia leader who had gone to fetch Younes from the front line had been arrested and had confessed that his subordinates had carried out the killing . `` It was not him . His lieutenants did it , '' Tarhouni said , without giving details about the militia . He added that the killers were still at large . Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said on Thursday Younes had been recalled for questioning to Benghazi but was killed before he arrived . Relatives said they retrieved a burned and bullet-riddled body . The rebels have seized swathes of the country , but five months into the rebellion still appear far from ousting Gaddafi and remain poorly equipped . Speculation about the assassination of Younes ranged widely . There were reports that he had been suspected of feeding the Gaddafi camp with information . One rebel commander said Islamists whom Younes had targeted in his job as interior minister may have been to blame . The United States , which like some 30 other nations has formally recognized the opposition , said Younes 's death was a blow but called for solidarity among the rebels . `` What 's important is that they work both diligently and transparently to ensure the unity of the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington . On Friday , weeping relatives and supporters brought Younes 's coffin into the main square of Benghazi to mourn him , as fighters fired guns in the air . Some family members vowed allegiance to the rebels ' political leader . `` A message to Mustafa Abdel Jalil : We will walk with you all the way , '' nephew Mohammed Younes told hundreds of mourners in the main square . Younes , from eastern Libya where the rebels are strongest , had been Gaddafi 's interior minister but switched sides to become the military chief in the rebel Transitional National Council . Rebel defense minister Omar Hariri , visiting the west , said Younes 's death would have an impact on rebel fighters . `` But they will recover , and there will be other leaders , '' he said . Rebels took swathes of Libya soon after launching their uprising in February against Gaddafi 's 41 years of domination of the oil-producing North African state , but have made few recent advances despite the support of NATO air strikes . They said they had seized several towns in the Western Mountains on Thursday but are yet to make a major breakthrough . A rebel commander near Ghezaia told Reuters on Friday that around 100 insurgents had taken control of the town , from which Gaddafi forces had dominated plains below the mountains . Reuters could not go there to confirm the report as rebels said the area could be mined . But through binoculars from a rebel-held ridge near Nalut , reporters could see no sign of Gaddafi 's forces in Ghezaia . Fighters on the front line near the town of Misrata said they viewed Younes as a martyr and would avenge his death . `` It will be an extra motive for us in the fight against the tyrant , '' said Khaled al-Uwayyib . With prospects fading for a negotiated settlement , the five-month-old civil war will grind on into the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in August . Nick Witney , analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris , said the West had hoped for a `` nice simple conflict '' with right prevailing , but this had ignored the nuanced , tribal nature of Libyan politics . `` It was a brave and right thing to do , '' he said . `` But I feel we 've lost the moral high ground a bit and wandered into something that will be prolonged and messy , but we 're not in a position to sort out . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It was the first time the alliance has done so for rebels in the west , said the commanders .

No wonder they did well today . They had a map showing where to atack and where the Pro Gaddafi supporters was . Is n't UN\\/NATO there to save lives not to help kill people ? But i guess that the supporters of Gaddafi have no right to support him and have no right to life . Is that how democracy is supposed to be ? He served Gaddafi for over 3 decades , he did not have a chance of survival . Surprised he lasted this long with the opposition .

A few miles away in Zlitan , controlled by Muammar Gaddafi , Libyans worry about sanctions and NATO strikes . As Libya 's civil war churns on into Ramadan with no end in sight , Libyans on both sides of the conflict say shortages , high prices , rising summer temperatures and worry about loved ones fighting on distant fronts could mar the Muslim fasting month . Misrata 's market is just a collection of makeshift stalls , built after the original market was destroyed in fighting . Given that Misrata is marooned in the Gaddafi-held west and only able to bring in supplies by sea , locals are resigned to shortages . `` Dates do not have a long shelf life . Our best dates are in the south , '' said Mohammed Abu Zreeba of the high-energy fruit popular among Muslims breaking the dawn-to-dusk fast . `` This is far from us and can not reach us by sea . Cars and transportation can not get here . '' Just a few miles west of Misrata , in the Gaddafi-held town of Zlitan , locals said sanctions and air strikes were biting . The Libyan government recently bussed foreign journalists to Zlitan to see what they said were government food warehouses it said were struck by planes from NATO , which says it strikes only military targets . Sacks of flour and rice and boxes of canned tomatoes and oil that were destined to be sold to Libyans at reduced prices were burned or sat surrounded by rubble . `` We use this food for Ramadan and now it is destroyed , '' nearby resident Mohamed Muftah said angrily . `` They want to starve us . '' Rebels fighting in the Western Mountains region , near Libya 's border with Tunisia , were worried about fighting without food and water in the searing heat . `` Ramadan will be very tough for us . We 're already struggling now . The weather will be very hot and we wo n't have the energy to fight while we are fasting , '' said Abdelbadr Adel , 19 , a rebel fighting in the Western Mountains . `` It is now more important than ever that NATO help us beat Gaddafi . We know Gaddafi 's men will not be fasting . '' The United Nations has warned of fuel and cash shortages on the eve of Ramadan , when families and friends typically gather to break their fast together with hearty meals . Long petrol lines snake down highways near the capital Tripoli . Ahmed al-Kafi , a retired diplomat who lives in the city of Sabratha west of Tripoli , said the fuel shortage would prevent him from visiting relatives and friends as he would normally do . Gaddafi 's finance minister , Abdulhafid Zlitni , told CNN earlier this month that the government was providing subsidies to control costs and fixing prices of basic foodstuffs . Zlitni said the country still has significant `` contingency reserves , ' but it was not clear how long the government , unable to access assets frozen abroad , could afford such support . Abdussalam bin Sulaiman , a Libyan journalist , said Ramadan this year would be overshadowed by the air strikes that rock Tripoli and other areas virtually every day . `` We hope but that by the time Eid al-Fitr comes around , this obsession with death will be finished , '' he said , referring to the feast that marks the end of the fast .

Its estimated 5,000 residents , supporters of Muammar Gaddafi , had been transported to his stronghold Tripoli by his militiamen , leaving behind a ghost town . `` We would have liked to have been welcomed here . These people all liked Gaddafi . They benefitted from him , '' said a rebel named Majdi , standing beside rows of houses built by Libyans aided by soft loans from the government . Libya 's six-month uprising is often described as a simple struggle to end decades of autocratic rule . But as the offensive in the Western Mountains illustrates , it is far more complex . Factionalism could fuel a civil war , even if Gaddafi falls , keeping the North African oil producer unstable . `` I just hope that we can oust Gaddafi and that his followers will let the past be the past and embrace democracy , '' said rebel Omar Ali Muhammad . `` Otherwise the country may face troubles even if he is pushed out . '' Gaddafi maintained supporters in Ghazaia and other places in the plains below the Western Mountains , despite international pressure on him to step down and defections of senior government officials . That is one reason why it took rebels , themselves disunited , months to make serious gains here . The veteran Libyan leader 's support network could also enable him to launch a counteroffensive and reverse rebel gains . While his opponents were still gaining military experience , Gaddafi was relying on residents of the rough desert region to give him further advantages over a novice rebel force . One provided his militiamen with extensive services . `` He gave Gaddafi 's soldiers everything . Intelligence on our movements , details on the routes we used , he even gave them sheep and goats , '' said rebel commander Salim al Hamdi , who was discussing strategy with comrades at the man 's house , which has been taken over by rebels . Government forces had been dug in at Ghazaia since the conflict began , setting up headquarters at a complex of houses the government helped people build . Soldiers also lived in villas , enjoying kitchens , television sets and radio . Now rebels are surrounding the town of Tiji , which also supports Gaddafi . On Sunday afternoon rebels on the frontline fired tank shells and anti-aircraft guns at government forces . `` They like Gaddafi in Tiji , '' said a rebel named Osama as missiles were fired back , pounding the earth . `` After Gaddafi loses we will remember that the people of Tiji loved him . That 's why it 's tough fighting here . It is a reality . '' Another fighter who overheard quickly rushed over to correct him . No everything will be fine .

BENGHAZI , Libya | Sun Jul 31 , 2011 12:41 am BST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels say the gunmen who shot dead their military chief were militiamen allied in their struggle to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi , raising questions about divisions and lawlessness within rebel ranks . The assassination of Abdel Fattah Younes , apparently by his own side , has hurt the opposition just as it was winning broader international recognition and launching an offensive against Gaddafi 's forces in the Western Mountains . After 24 hours of confusion , rebel minister Ali Tarhouni said Younes had been killed by fighters who were sent to fetch him from the front and his bullet-riddled and partially burnt body was found at a ranch near the rebel capital of Benghazi . Tarhouni said late on Friday a militiaman had been arrested and confessed that his subordinates had carried out the killing . Younes had been part of Gaddafi 's inner circle since the 1969 coup that brought the Libyan colonel to power and was interior minister before defecting to the rebels in February . Many rebels had been uncomfortable working under a man who had been so close to Gaddafi for 41 years , and rebel sources said on Thursday Younes had been recalled over suspicions he or his family were secretly in contact with the Libyan leader . Rebels were divided over who had killed Younes , some suspecting his execution was ordered by rebel leaders for treason , many believing he was killed by Gaddafi supporters who had infiltrated rebel ranks , and still others suggesting a rebel splinter group had acted alone . Gaddafi 's government pointed the finger at Fawzi Bu Kitf , head of the Union of Revolutionary Forces , a federation of armed rebel groups operating in the east of the country . In an apparent effort to distance himself from the killing , Bu Kitf on Saturday named the key suspect as Mustafa al-Rubh , the field commander who had been dispatched to arrest Younes . `` He is a member of the Union as an individual , '' Bu Kitf told reporters . `` Whatever was done was done through his own idea . '' Whatever the truth , the killing deepens concerns among the rebels ' Western backers , keen to see them prevail in a five-month-old civil war but frustrated by their lack of unity and nervous about the influence of Islamists . The United States , which like some 30 other nations has formally recognized the opposition , called for solidarity . `` What 's important is that they work both diligently and transparently to ensure the unity of the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington . Rebels who rose up against Gaddafi in February have seized swathes of the country but remain poorly equipped and are still far from ousting him , despite support from NATO airstrikes . Rebels said on Saturday they had encircled Gaddafi 's last stronghold in the Western Mountains and hoped to seize it soon . Rebel tanks fired at Tiji , where some 500 government troops are stationed . `` We have Tiji surrounded and we hope to take it by the end of the day , '' rebel commander Nasir al-Hamdi , a former police colonel , told Reuters as gunfire crackled in the distance . Rebels also made a new push on the front just west of the rebel-held city of Misrata . Hospital sources said 12 rebels were killed and 60 wounded in fighting that rebels said took them to the edge of Zlitan , the largest city between Misrata and the capital Tripoli to the west . `` Most of the casualties today were from GRAD missiles and mortar fire . We have advanced well and God willing we will be in Zlitan soon , '' said Ibrhaim Buwathi , 24 . NATO strikes also continued in western Libya overnight . NATO said early on Saturday it had bombed three satellite dishes in Tripoli to stop `` terror broadcasts '' by Gaddafi , but Libyan state TV remained on air and condemned what it said was the targeting of journalists . As Libya 's civil war grinds on into Ramadan with no end in sight , Libyans on both sides of the conflict say shortages , high prices , rising summer temperatures and worry about loved ones fighting on distant fronts could mar the Muslim fasting month . `` Ramadan will be very tough for us . We 're already struggling now . The weather will be very hot and we wo n't have the energy to fight while we are fasting , '' said Abdelbadr Adel , 19 , a rebel fighting in the Western Mountains . In the east , confusion reigned over who had killed Younes . Rebel fighters said members of the February 17 Martyrs ' Brigade , a rebel group that is part of the Union of Revolutionary Forces , had collected Younes from the frontline near Brega on Thursday . However , Tarhouni , the rebel minister , said it was another militia , the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade , who had killed Younes . Locals said the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade mainly comprised former prisoners of Gaddafi 's notorious Abu Salim prison in the capital Tripoli , who had always distrusted Younes . Obaid Ibn Jarrah Brigade was not a member of the Union , which is employed by the Transitional National Council for security . Named after one of the companions of Islam 's Prophet Mohammad , the group is likely to have Islamist leanings . One rebel commander , who asked not to be named , said Islamists whom Younes had targeted as interior minister may have killed him in retaliation . `` Some of those Islamists are now fighting with the rebels and they have always refused to fight under Younes 's command and have always viewed him with suspicion , '' he said . `` I do n't think the investigation will lead anywhere . They do n't dare to touch the Islamists . '' Further complicating an already murky situation , some Libyans said they feared that Younes ' death would trigger a bloody tribal feud . But in an apparent effort to calm nerves , a rebel source said Younes could be replaced by Suleiman Mahmoud al-Obeidi , a member of the same tribe . The longer the war drags on , the further eastern Libya appears to slip into lawlessness , raising questions about what kind of Libya could emerge if Gaddafi goes . Tarhouni told reporters on Friday night a gang had attacked a prison using rocket-propelled grenades , helping about 300 former Gaddafi soldiers and loyalists to escape .

Some fight Gaddafi 's troops on the front line while others handle security in rebel-held cities . And , in a country flooded with weapons , some gunmen are simply helping themselves to whatever they want , members of the armed opposition say . The still unexplained killing of top rebel commander General Abdul Fattah Younes last week raised doubts about the loyalty to the rebel cause of some fighters . Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam has done his best to exploit differences within the opposition , telling the New York Times he had made contact with Islamists among the rebels , and that a government-Islamist alliance would be announced within days . He said he had been in contact with an Islamist rebel leader , Ali Sallabi -- who was quoted by the New York Times as acknowledging the contacts but as saying he remained allied with the liberal rebels trying to oust Gaddafi . `` Now the brigades and armed groups are too many . Every neighborhood has one , '' said rebel fighter Yasser . `` Some people use the weapons for crime and theft . '' `` Everyone knows how to use a gun , '' he said . `` The Libyans are an armed people . Even my mother knows guns . '' Yasser 's brigade is officially recognized by the higher rebel authorities . It was raised in Benghazi by a handful of young men who took up guns to protect the neighborhood against Gaddafi forces and criminals , and now numbers over 100 fighters . As the civil war enters its sixth month , armed groups roam the streets in the rebel stronghold , raising fears of creeping lawlessness . They drive around in pickups , firing their assault rifles into the air . It is not always clear to which group they belong or whether it is approved by the National Transitional Council , recognized by some Western powers as Libya 's legitimate government . `` In my neighborhood there are groups who guard the area , they are not officially organised , but they have guns , '' said a rebel official . `` Anybody can go to the front and fight . It is easy to get a gun . If I take my AK-47 and want to fight on the front line , no one can stop me . '' Benghazi resident Essa , a steel worker before the war , proudly shows a video of 7 rocket-propelled grenade launchers made in his workshop from army weapons parts . The RPGs were used against Gaddafi 's troops on the western front in Misrata . Others put their military loot to questionable use . Dull explosions echo round Benghazi harbor as fishermen detonate explosives in the sea for a quick catch . U.S. officials say they are worried about reports that al Qaeda may already be smuggling arms and explosives out of Libya . A United Nations official draws a parallel with the mayhem in Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion and the fall of Saddam . `` We kept telling them in Iraq that they have to secure the -LRB- weapons -RRB- stores , but no one listened , '' he said . `` Next we would see these weapons being smuggled across the border to Iran . '' The Mahdi Army of anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr started as a neighborhood protection force , but grew quickly in strength and was later blamed for much of the 2006-07 sectarian slaughter that drove Iraq to the brink of civil war . The killing of Younes has raised similar concerns here . Some rebel sources say it was the work of Islamist militiamen in the rebel ranks , and exposed the opposition to the risk of a split that could spark a tribal feud . Armed groups such as Obaida Ibn Jarrah and Okbah Ibn Nafih brigades have been named as possible perpetrators . Both are named after companions of the Prophet Mohammad . Some say Gaddafi loyalists were obviously behind the killing of Younes , who defected after holding top government posts for 40 years -- including that of interior minister , which would have put him at odds with Islamist opponents of Gaddafi . Younes 's tribe has sworn to get justice itself if the rebel leaders fail to investigate his death and catch his killers . His death was followed by a prison break by some 300 Gaddafi loyalists and a battle between rebels and the militia who helped the prisoners to escape in the center of Benghazi . The militiamen belong to a group called Nedaa Libya , or Libya 's Call , which is not an official force under rebel authority . Fighters in Benghazi who know them never thought they might be Gaddafi loyalists until the prison break . `` We heard about them before but did n't know they were fifth columnists , '' said Faraj al-Sharif , a rebel fighter from the Martyrs of February 17th brigade . He estimates their number at 1,000 fighters , many of them still at large . `` Every time we ask them to surrender , they stop for a while then they start firing at us and shout Allah , Muammar , Libya and that 's all , '' he said . Benghazi residents now talk of Gaddafi `` sleeper cells '' in guerrilla ranks and mistrust is spreading among the locals , who treat everyone with suspicion . Rebel leader Mustafa Abdul-Jalil , trying to soothe public anger and avert a feud , urged militias to lay down their arms or come under the orders of the Defense or Interior ministries . It remains unclear how he can follow up such exhortations . -LRB- Editing by Douglas Hamilton and Tim Pearce -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "208", "dct": "2011-08-05", "dates": ["2011-08-05", "2011-08-05", "2011-02-01", "2011-08-03", "2011-01-01", "2012-07-28", "2011-08-05", "2011-08-02", "2011-07-23", "2011-06-01"], "text": "LONDON | Fri Aug 5 , 2011 12:48 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mired in a slow-moving ground war , Libya 's warring parties are turning to propaganda to try to splinter each other 's support base and gain leverage in talks on a political settlement . Muammar Gaddafi is playing on fears among Libyans that Western-backed rebels will tip the country deeper into chaos . The opposition 's message is that only an end to Gaddafi 's 41-year-old rule can bring peace , stability and justice . The war of words is not new : Both sides took to the airwaves and the Internet within hours of the February start of a revolt against Gaddafi 's government . But now international contacts are under way on a political solution , both sides are looking more urgently at psychological warfare to boost negotiating clout in the absence of a decisive military move in Libya 's deserts , mountains and towns . An eye-catching example of the information struggle emerged on Wednesday when one of Gaddafi 's sons aired the possibility of an alliance with Islamist `` terrorists , '' a startling U-turn after the government 's previous insistence that its main enemy in the conflict was al Qaeda . `` Libya will look like Saudi Arabia , like Iran . Saif al-Islam told the New York Times , adding he would now form an alliance with Islamists among the rebels . Saif al-Islam has campaigned prominently for reconciliation with Islamist militants over the past five years , and helped arrange the release of hundreds of them from prison . But the killing by Gaddafi loyalists of civilians in the 2011 uprising destroyed Saif al-Islam 's credibility with Islamists , analysts say . His latest remarks were greeted with derision by a wide range of Libyan opposition commentators . `` It 's childish scare tactics , '' U.S.-based Libyan activist Hafed al-Ghwell told Reuters . `` The logic is , ` Let 's frighten the hell out of the West by suggesting we 'll ally with Islamists . ' '' `` He knows very well that if Islamists ever move on Tripoli , their first target will be Gaddafi and his family . '' Ashour Shamis , a UK-based opposition activist and editor , said Islam 's remarks showed the Gaddafi camp was `` absolutely desperate . It 's pathetic . '' `` They are clutching at straws , '' he said . Noman Benotman , a former opposition guerrilla commander who once worked closely with Saif al-Islam on his reconciliation program , said the government had started to work with some members of a highly conservative , apolitical group of Salafi Islamists in Tripoli to try to counter rebel influence . State television has also spoken vaguely of a possible Islamist tie-up . Benotman said , however , that Saif al-Islam 's claim of a link to Islamists working within the rebel camp were false and `` psychological warfare . '' But if the purported Gaddafi-Islamist tie-up sounds outlandish , the rebels ' credibility is if anything more compromised . Despite weeks of sporadic gains on the ground and advances on the diplomatic arena , the rebels are on the defensive in the battle for Libyan hearts and minds as never before following the unexplained death on July 28 of their military leader Abdel Fattah Younes . His killing has drawn attention to rifts in the rebel camp , an assortment of armed groups that , especially in the east , has struggled to project an image of unity -LRB- ID : nLDE7731AF -RRB- Younes 's family has criticised the handling of the murky case by the rebel National Transitional Council and said it might take justice into its own hands unless rebel leaders come clean over exactly who killed him . A propaganda gift to Gaddafi , the killing has raised concerns over instability and sustained trouble even if the opposition ousts the veteran leader . GADDAFI POINTS TO EGYPT , TUNISIA UNREST Worries are running so deep that when a rebel spokesman on Friday reported the death of another of Gaddafi 's sons , Khamis , Libya-watchers immediately suspected it was a propaganda ploy to distract attention from Saif al-Islam 's New York Times interview , which received wide attention in the Arab world . `` It 's probably just propaganda , '' one Libya analyst said . `` It looks a bit desperate . '' The report was denied with hours by a Gaddafi spokesman . Apparently buoyed by Younes 's death , Saif al-Islam on Aug 2 seemed to remove a government offer of ceasefire talks if NATO stopped bombing , saying regardless of whether NATO disengaged from Libya , the war would continue until all Libya was freed . Pointing to post-revolution unrest in Egypt and Tunisia , Gaddafi said in a July 23 audio address that the uprisings there had resulted in looting and destruction . The message may well have been intended for a local audience , analysts say . Gaddafi in June posed playing chess with a senior Russian chess player , looking relaxed and focus . Al-Ghwell , the U.S.-based Libya activist , said he worried that the ousting of Gaddafi was taking such a long time , although he was confident the rebels would eventually win . `` The fact is that the longer this lasts the more likely we 'll have more incidents like the killing of Younes and the more likely we 'll have a messy situation in general .

Full Article Family 's death illustrates divided Libya SOUQ AL-JUMAA , Libya | Fri Aug 5 , 2011 8:12 am IST SOUQ AL-JUMAA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A few kilometers from the front-lines , some of the youngest victims of Libya 's civil war lay on Thursday in simple coffins , testimony to the toll of the conflict in which neither side boasts a clear advantage . Musatafa al-Marabit , his feet bandaged and his clothes spotted with blood , was led sobbing from the three coffins containing the bodies of his wife and two young sons . They were reportedly killed by an airstrike early on Thursday in their home west of Zlitan , the strategically located city some 160 kilometres -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli that has become Libya 's third front . In a conflict in which murkiness and mutual suspicions abound , foreign journalists were bussed to Zlitan , where nearby rebels are battling Gaddafi 's forces on a fluctuating front - line , to film the remains of Marabit 's house and to a nearby burial site to examine the blood-stained bodies of his boys . Marabit 's wife Ibtisam , who officials said was killed alongside her children while her husband attended morning prayers , lay in another coffin which was unopened in keeping with Islamic tradition . For supporters of Gaddafi , who has defied expectations since Western powers began their air campaign in March by clinging defiantly to power , the incident was proof of the brutality of foreign aggressors who dared to strike civilians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . `` They are attacking Islam ; there is no other explanation , '' neighbor Atiya Mohamed shouted as he stood among the rubble that was Marabit 's home . Yet NATO and the rebels hoping to seize Zlitan and eventually capture the fortified capital will likely portray it as more evidence of Gaddafi stationing civilians at military sites as he seeks to avoid further damage to his fighting prowess . The Gaddafi government routinely reports deaths inflicted by NATO airstrikes , whose victims it calls ` martyrs , ' but Thursday 's events marked the first time in weeks officials had offered details of the identities of those it said were killed by NATO bombs . It was also the first time in weeks it had offered journalists an opportunity to report on human victims of airstrikes at close range . After the attack , NATO acknowledged it had hit a military command site in the area around 6:30 a.m. , approximately the time officials and neighbors said Marabit 's house was struck . `` We always take seriously allegations of civilian casualties and are looking into it , but we have no evidence at this stage that this was caused by an air strike , '' a NATO official in Naples said . While there was no evidence of any military activity among the shattered cinderblock and cushions strewn around Marabit 's destroyed home , rebels fighting for control of Zlitan raised questions about the building 's true use . If confirmed , the attack near Zlitan would not be the first time since Western-led airstrikes began in Libya in late March that NATO activity has resulted in civilian deaths . In June , NATO admitted it destroyed a house in Tripoli in which Libyan officials said nine civilians were killed . Shortly afterwards , the Libyan government reported almost 20 people were killed in a strike on the home of a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . More such incidents could undermine support for a campaign already on shaky ground in some NATO nations , where financial pressures have added to doubts about a campaign that has yet to bring peace in Libya . Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said the incident would stoke anti-Western rage . `` What NATO is doing is very dangerous . It is planting the seeds of hatred in the hearts of millions of Libyans , '' he said . Residents of Zlitan and Souq al-Jumaa , on the town 's western outskirts , brushed aside rebel claims this week Gaddafi 's opponents were on the cusp of capturing the town . Zlitan was quiet as foreign journalists toured the center of the town on Thursday afternoon , as fasting Muslims rested or stayed indoors due to the heat . But the silence was interrupted regularly by the thuds of shelling or rocket attacks just to the east . Government minders took journalists to see several other sites apparently hit by NATO strikes , including a large school and the local law college , where among rubble and law books lay empty ammunition boxes and green military clothing in the dirt . Mohamed Salim , minding a deserted toy store , said some Zlitan residents had fled and power cuts had become more frequent as fighting had increased in the past few weeks . But he said he was n't afraid of the advance of rebels . `` I only fear god , '' he said . -LRB- Editing by Douglas Hamilton and Sophie Hares -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "36", "dct": "2011-08-06", "dates": ["2011-08-06", "2011-08-06", "2011-08-06", "2011-08-06", "2011-07-01", "2011-08-05", "2011-08-05", "2011-03-01", "2011-01-01", "2011-03-01", "2011-08-06"], "text": "Libyan rebels fire a wire-guided missile at a position belonging to forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , at the frontline near the town of Zlitan , west of the rebel-controlled city of Misrata August 6 , 2011 . BENGHAZI , Libya | Sat Aug 6 , 2011 2:44 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels Saturday said they had launched a push to capture the coastal oil town of Brega , but were advancing slowly because Muammar Gaddafi 's forces had sown minefields across its approaches . `` There 's a big movement on all fronts around Brega . We are attacking from three sides , '' said spokesman Mohammad Zawawi . Fighting on the eastern front of the civil war , which has moved backwards and forwards for the past months , has been bogged down for weeks on the fringes of Brega , about 750 kilometers -LRB- 465 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . Zawawi said rebel forces were in sight of a residential area of Brega and believed they could take the town , which is south of the rebel capital Benghazi on the eastern side of the Gulf of Sirte . `` It could be very soon , but we do n't want to lose anybody so we 're moving slowly but surely , '' he said . In Misrata , a Qatari plane made a quick stop to offload ammunition destined for rebel fighters , sources with knowledge of the flight said . Airport officials acknowledged a Qatari plane had landed but declined to reveal details of its contents . `` The plane offloaded six pickup trucks which were packed with ammunition , and minutes later it flew off again , '' said one source , speaking on condition of anonymity . Rebels have complained about a lack of weapons and ammunition to effectively push forward to the capital . France has also supplied ammunition and weapons in air-drops . Qatar has been one of staunchest supporters of Libyans seeking to topple Muammar Gaddafi from power . Friday was another day of claim and counter-claim in the six-month-old war now being waged on three fronts -- in the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli , near Misrata to the east of the capital , and around Brega between Misrata and Benghazi . Gaddafi 's government Friday denied a rebel report a NATO air strike on Zlitan , a town west of Misrata , had killed the Libyan leader 's son Khamis who commands of one of the government 's most loyal and best-equipped units . Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said word of Khamis Gaddafi 's death was a ploy to cover up the killing of three civilians in Zlitan , a battlefront city where Gaddafi forces are trying to halt the rebel advance on Tripoli . `` It 's false news . This is a dirty trick to cover up their crime in Zlitan , '' he told Reuters . A rebel spokesman said the NATO air strike had killed 32 Gaddafi loyalists in Zlitan , where Khamis Gaddafi 's elite 32nd Brigade is believed to have been leading the defense of the approaches to Tripoli , 160 kilometers away . NATO said it had targeted a command-and-control target in the Zlitan area but `` can not confirm anything right now because we do n't have people on the ground . '' Rebels who cleared Gaddafi 's forces from Libya 's third-largest city Misrata after weeks of intense fighting have been trying to push westwards and take Zlitan , which would open the coastal road toward his Tripoli stronghold . There have been two reports of Khamis 's death in the past six months : Arab media reported in March he had died in a kamikaze crash by a disaffected Libyan air force pilot . Libyan state television countered with pictures of a man resembling Khamis , which it said disproved the report of his death . The government said earlier this year a NATO strike in Tripoli had killed Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Arab , who unlike Khamis did not have a high public profile or a major leadership role . Gaddafi has kept control of the capital despite severe fuel shortages and rebel advances backed since March by Western air strikes , assault helicopter attacks and naval bombardments . The rebels face numerous problems , from stalling battlefield momentum to internal splits , exposed starkly last week when military chief Abdel Fattah Younes was assassinated behind his own lines in circumstances yet to be explained . Near the capital , rebels also control the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli . A rebel official there , Colonel Juma Ibrahim , told Reuters his forces had set an ultimatum to the surrounded town of Tiji to surrender or face attack Saturday . Rebels were using loud-hailers to appeal to a tribal chief close to Gaddafi to evacuate civilians from Tiji and broker the withdrawal of pro-Gaddafi forces . `` If he does not comply , we will attack , '' said Ibrahim .

Britain recognized the NTC as Libya 's sole legitimate government in late July and said it would invite a new Libyan diplomatic mission made up of opponents of Gaddafi . `` The National Transitional Council is the sole legitimate governmental authority in Libya . It is therefore right that their representatives are now staffing the Libyan Embassy , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . The Times newspaper reported that Gaddafi 's government was planning to use anti-squatter laws to try to evict the embassy 's new occupants . It said Gaddafi 's lawyers were also seeking to challenge Britain 's recognition of the opposition and to prevent Britain from using frozen Libyan state assets . A Foreign Office spokesman said he was not aware of any such legal proceedings against the British government . The NTC had said families of rebel civil war victims would hoist the red , black and green flag representing the Libyan rebel movement over the embassy in the Belgravia district . The green Libyan flag of the Gaddafi government flew above the building until this weekend . It has since been removed . `` The reopening of the Embassy symbolises how far we have come .

The independent aid agency , which delivers vital supplies and collects the wounded and dead from battlefields , called for a halt to deadly assaults on medical facilities and personnel . `` Hospitals in Sri Lanka and Somalia have been shelled , ambulances in Libya shot at , paramedics in Colombia killed and wounded people in Afghanistan forced to languish for hours in vehicles held up at checkpoints , '' Yves Daccord , ICRC director-general , said in a statement . The ICRC has documented security incidents in 16 countries that disrupted delivery of health care , many of them deliberate attacks violating international humanitarian law , according to its report `` Health Care in Danger : Making the Case . '' `` The most shocking finding is that people die in large numbers not because they are direct victims of a roadside bomb or a shooting , '' said Dr. Robin Coupland , who led the research . `` They die because the ambulance does not get there in time , because health personnel are prevented from doing their work , because hospitals are themselves targets of attacks or simply because the environment is too dangerous for effective health care to be delivered , '' said the British war surgeon . The violence , often accompanied by looting , means doctors and nurses leave their jobs , hospitals run out of drugs or fuel to run generators and vaccination campaigns grind to a halt . This leaves patients even more vulnerable to diseases which can break out in conflict areas , such as polio and cholera . In Libya , a healthcare system that relied on foreign workers was crippled when the civil war prompted an exodus , leaving hospitals in Misrata and Benghazi critically understaffed . Under the Geneva Conventions , the wounded and sick , whether civilians or combatants , must receive prompt medical treatment . Yet many armies and rebels flout humanitarian law , according to the ICRC , which is launching a four-year awareness campaign . `` In conflicts all over the world , combatants overlook their responsibility to care for civilians caught in the crossfire . Invariably , it is relatives and neighbors who bring civilian casualties to hospital , '' it said . Hospitals have been used to store weapons or launch attacks , contravening the principle that they should be neutral and provide care to all patients , the report said . Afghanistan , Iraq , Sri Lanka and Somalia have suffered some of the worst attacks against medical centers and staff , it said . Somalia , now reeling from famine in the south , lost only the second batch of medical graduates in 20 years when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a university ceremony in Mogadishu in December 2009 , killing 22 . In a particularly outrageous attack in Afghanistan , Taliban insurgents in the southern city of Kandahar used an ambulance packed with explosives last April to kill 12 people at a police training base , the ICRC said . The Arab Spring has brought fresh abuses , according to the ICRC , whose officials run mobile clinics , perform war surgery and negotiate safe passage for ambulances through checkpoints . `` In recent unrest in Bahrain , Syria and Yemen , protesters have been too afraid to use medical facilities for fear their wounds will identify them and provoke harsh reprisals , '' it said . In Bahrain , the tiny Sunni-ruled Gulf state which crushed pro-democracy protests in February , the military took over Salmaniya hospital in Manama `` after it was perceived to support the cause of anti-government protesters , '' the report said . Some 47 doctors and nurses who treated injured protesters mostly from the majority Shi'ite community were detained in `` sweeping arrests of health workers , '' it said . Some face trial in a military court . The ICRC said it had reports from Libya suggesting that Ajdabiyah hospital was `` used as cover for snipers , '' a violation of the hospital 's protected status . It gave no details . `` In Libya , the ICRC is also receiving allegations of the misuse of the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems to support military operations and the use of ambulances to transport arms and armed combatants , '' it added .

In the video , the door of a shipping container on the back of one of the trucks was swung open . Inside , concealed behind some cardboard packaging , was a large plastic tank which one of the men present said contained fuel . The seizure was confirmed by a source in western Libya , near the border with Tunisia , who is working with anti-Gaddafi rebels . `` Container trucks with gasoline were trying to go from Tunisia to Libya and were blocked from entry .

OMV said the unrest in Libya would continue to halt its production there for the rest of the year while Saras , which swung to a net loss , said it will reduce refining runs in the second half to help offset the shortfall . Saras , Italy 's No. 3 refiner , is normally a big buyer of Libyan crude , with some 35 percent to 40 percent of supplies coming from the North African country . `` Until the Libyan situation stabilizes I do n't see Saras doing great things , it 's a catalyzer for the stock , '' a Milan-based analyst said .

OMV 's Libyan production was normal until February 20 and then fell sharply as the revolt against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule forced it to turn to oil from other countries . It obtained around a tenth of its oil from Libya last year but production is now zero . The group has a long-term stake in the crisis-hit country with 12 exploration and production licenses and Libyan petroleum contracts running up to 2032 . In its half-year report , Saras said it had established ties with the new political structures being created in Libya , adding this had allowed it to close a commercial deal . In July sources said a tanker carrying crude oil had sailed from Benghazi to Sardinia , as Libya 's rebels sold the last of their stockpile to raise urgently needed funds . OMV said high exploration expenses , lower refining margins and foreign exchange rates hurt results as high oil prices failed to offset lower output .

Gaddafi is clinging to power despite a near five-month-old NATO air campaign , tightening economic sanctions , and a lengthening war with rebels trying to end his 41-year rule . The rebels have seized large swathes of the North African state , but are deeply divided and lack experience , and Thursday 's gains in the east broke weeks of stalemate . One rebel spokesman said the opposition had captured the residential districts of Brega but Gaddafi 's forces still hold western parts of the town where the oil facilities are located . `` It is liberated . It is under our control now , '' spokesman Mossa Mahmoud al-Mograbi said of the eastern part of the town . The residential area where the fighting was taking place is about 15 km -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- east of the oil terminal and sea port . It was not immediately possible for a Reuters reporter to verify the capture of Brega and rebels have repeatedly claimed to have seized towns , only to be repelled by Gaddafi 's forces . In the western mountains , rebels said they reached the village of Bir Shuaib , some 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- from Zawiyah , which has unsuccessfully risen up against Gaddafi twice this year . It lies less than 50 km west of Tripoli , on the main road to Tunisia , which has been a lifeline for Libya but has begun to crack down on rampant smuggling of gasoline . `` We 've gone past Nasr village and right now we 're about 25 km from Zawiyah , '' said Faris , a rebel fighter . Rebels prevented reporters from reaching the front to see for themselves . Rebels in the western mountains do not operate as a single force , as each town has its own command . But when they join forces for major operations they can muster a few thousand men . Their force is poorly trained and short of heavy weapons , despite a French arms drop earlier this year , and most analysts do not think they are capable of capturing Tripoli . In an effort to pile economic and military pressure on Gaddafi , more countries are set to announce next week that they will free frozen assets for the rebels , a British official said . `` While it 's hard to predict when this will end , it 's easy to see the pressure is building on Gaddafi and it is only a matter of time before he 's forced to leave power , '' the official said . Britain is playing a leading role in NATO air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces , which have weakened his armory but have not enabled the rebels to deliver a knockout blow . Tightening the economic noose around Gaddafi , Tunisia said on Thursday its troops were patrolling fuel stations to curb the flow of smuggled gasoline into neighboring Libya . International sanctions and the effects of Libya 's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of fuel to parts of the country under Gaddafi 's control , but huge volumes of gasoline are instead being smuggled across the Libyan-Tunisian border . `` The armed forces are now conducting checks at fuel stations in the south of Tunisia ... so that neither Tunisians nor Libyans can fill up with large quantities , '' Tunisian defense ministry official Mokhtar Ben Nasr told a news conference . `` These checks are aimed at preventing the smuggling of diesel and gasoline to Libya . '' The western battle is one of three widely separated rebel fronts against Gaddafi forces . In the east around the ports of Misrata and Brega , fighting had been bogged down in recent weeks while the western rebels have advanced . The two sides have been battling for months over Brega , 750 km east of Tripoli . The rebels see securing the oil facilities as a tipping point in the war and hope to resume oil exports from there as quickly as possible . In the west , doctor Nuri Al-Fasi said one fighter had been killed and four wounded on Thursday in the rebel push . At a nearby field hospital , he looked over a rebel shot in the stomach in the fighting in Nasr . `` This is very serious . I do n't think he will make it , '' said al-Fasi , shaking his head . Dozens of pick-up trucks packed with rebels drove to a staging post a few kilometers behind the front line . From rebel-held Misrata , east of Tripoli , rebels were fighting to break a partial encirclement by Gaddafi forces , striking south into the nearby village of Tawurgha . Medical sources said six rebels were killed and 70 wounded in their offensive on Tawurgha , from which Gaddafi 's supporters have been firing rockets at Misrata for weeks . `` Our rebels have just liberated Tawurgha . This is great news ... as this means that the rockets of Gaddafi 's forces can not reach Misrata anymore , '' said rebel spokesman Hassan Algallay . Rebels said the offensive was led in coordination with NATO to protect Misrata from missile attacks . He said NATO asked rebels on Wednesday to paint their vehicles yellow and red . The offensive comes days after Gaddafi 's government accused NATO of killing 85 civilians , including women and children , in an air strike near Zlitan , west of rebel-held Misrata . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon voiced alarm over recent reports of civilian casualties and called on all sides to avoid killing innocent people . Dozens of Libyans protested outside the Hungarian embassy in Tripoli , which has become an unofficial contact point for European nations and the United States , against NATO airstrikes . Rights group Amnesty International also called on NATO in a statement to `` thoroughly investigate '' allegations of civilian deaths in the strikes on the village of Majar , close to the front line at Zlitan . NATO said it hit a military target . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . NATO leadership is so greedy & soulless & desperate to install their puppets from Benghazi who do not even represent a fair number of Libyans-but western interests . The Govt troops can let the rebels enter unopposed into some of these towns , then intermingle with them and we see how NATO will use its savagery of bombing street by street , and home to home killing everyone including rebels . They may like that better though since after that they can land peacefully in an empty country to enjoy the oil , the only thing they seem care out . Even most citizens in the NATO countries are wallowing in poverty , the leaders are having fun with wars abroad and other scandals . SHAME ON UK , FRANCE and all NATO leaders . What a TRAVESTY the UN has become ! Every single liberated city or village in Libya is thanking UK , France , US and NATO for their support . Free Libyans , the ones who can speak their minds without the oppression of a tyrant , do support the National Transitional Council -- meaning a free Libya . With the help of western countries and NATO , Libya will finally be a free country . Thanks to UN and the resolution 1973 , millions of Libyans will enjoy a normal life , at last !!! Freedom !!! It is easy to see the one sided views of some that want to thank UK\\/France and USA . What about rebel behavior who killed own leader the other day ? What about the bodies of Gadaffi soldiers that were found hidden by the rebels ? What about the retribution reported in some rebel held areas ? Some cities have refused to allow those rebels entry but prefer own tibes fill the Vacuum after soldiers of Govt leave , Just to mention a few ! NATO is a for Profit body , otherwise how can one explain the intransigence of rejecting all peace initiatives and sensible efforts by China , Russia , AU etc. . No Fly zone was complete achieved , so why propel the rag-tag group to Tripoli , they never even had in the first place . It is therefore extreme naivety for anyone to expect NATO to deliver Libya to better times . All they can do is destroy it . Only Libyans will develop Libya will only happen they make peace after NATO has left-no matter how long that is . In the meantime-Libya might join Iraq and other Gulf states that serve the masters and not are really bothered or able to do otherwise-with all the Military bases now in their countries .

They pushed north to a settlement called Bir Shuaib , taking them within 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- of their target of Zawiyah , a town less than 50 km from Tripoli , the stronghold of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . `` We 've gone past Nasr village and right now we 're about 25 km from Zawiyah , '' said Faris , a rebel fighter . Rebels prevented reporters from getting up to the new front line to see for themselves . Evidence of help from NATO air strikes was seen at the village of Shalghouda , on the route of the rebel advance . There were signs of recent fighting and a large building had collapsed , apparently after being hit by a NATO bomb or missile . A green tent , green army cap and green army uniform lay on the ground among pulverised concrete -- the color of government forces fighting under the flag of Gaddafi 's Libya . Rebels said they had taken the village of Nasr , where there was a concentration of pro-Gaddafi forces . On the edge of Bir al-Ghanam , south of the new front line , fighters drove by in pick-up trucks and yelled `` Allahu Akbar -LRB- God is greatest -RRB- , victory in Nasr '' . At a nearby checkpoint young rebels played football and said they were happy because they expected victory soon . There was an array of pick-up trucks with sand oiled on for camouflage . Modified helicopter rocket launchers were mounted on the back of the pickup trucks . From Misrata , a port city east of the capital controlled by anti-Gaddafi forces , there were unconfirmed reports of a rebel offensive to break through a partial encirclement by Gaddafi forces , striking south in the direction of Tawurgha . At least two rebels were killed and over a dozen were wounded there , according to one unofficial report from a source in rebel-held Misrata . The rebels in the west have advanced rapidly since capturing Bir al-Ghanam on Saturday , breaking weeks of stalemate on this front in Libya 's civil war . Gaddafi 's forces launched Grad rockets at rebel positions in the small desert settlement on Wednesday and rebels fired back with rockets and machine guns . Gaddafi describes the rebels as rats and says they are criminals inspired by al Qaeda . Thick white smoke was rising at the edge of Bir al-Ghanam during the fighting . One rebel was killed and 10 were wounded , doctors said . There was no word on government casualties . Zawiyah is the hometown of many rebels fighting their way north towards the main highway running parallel to the Mediterranean shore into the heart of Tripoli . Rebel reinforcements in jeeps with anti-aircraft guns were brought up to Bir al-Ghanam on Wednesday and both sides exchanged insults over the army radio network . -LRB- Editing by Douglas Hamilton and Elizabeth Piper -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "272", "dct": "2011-08-12", "dates": ["2011-08-12", "2011-08-12", "2011-08-11", "2011-08-12", "2011-08-12", "2011-08-12", "2011-08-11", "2011-08-11", "2011-01-01", "2011-08-12", "2011-08-12", "2011-07-01", "2011-08-11"], "text": "AJDABIYAH , Libya | Fri Aug 12 , 2011 6:11 pm EDT AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels on the eastern front of Libya 's civil war lost 11 men in the past 24 hours fighting to capture the strategic oil terminal and refinery at Brega on the Mediterranean coast , hospital sources said . Sources at a hospital in Ajdabiyah to the northeast said about 50 were wounded on Thursday and Friday and one civilian in the all-but-deserted town was killed when a rocket fired by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces hit a house . The rebels have taken the residential zone of New Brega . But that is 15 km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the terminal and port area . They hope that capturing the port 750 km east of the capital Tripoli will be a tipping point in their nearly six-month campaign to oust Gaddafi . They want to begin exporting oil from Brega as quickly as possible . But the battle for it has been going on for months . `` There 's close fighting in the oil terminal area this morning but maybe we can finish it off today , '' rebel soldier Mohammad Muftah said . Troops loyal to Gaddafi were holding onto the oil facilities , firing rockets at rebel positions . Gaddafi is clinging to power despite a near five-month-old NATO air campaign , tightening economic sanctions , and a lengthening war with rebels trying to end his 41-year rule . The rebels have seized large swathes of the North African state , but are deeply divided and lack experience , and Thursday 's gains in the east broke weeks of stalemate . In the west , rebel forces driving north toward the town of Zawiyah , within striking distance of Gaddafi 's stronghold in the capital , have not moved up from Thursday 's positions . Rebels said they had reached the village of Bir Shuaib , some 25 km from Zawiyah , which has unsuccessfully risen up against Gaddafi twice this year . Reuters interviewed a captured intelligence officer who said Gaddafi had reinforced Zawiyah , which also has a coastal oil refinery , with about 1,000 conscripts . But there were no heavy weapons there and no African mercenaries as rebels insist . Brigadier-General Al-Hadi al-Ujaili predicted the rebels would face a hard fight to capture the town . He said Gaddafi still enjoys strong support in Tripoli and among Libya 's main tribes , which he said was crucial . The western battle is one of three widely separated rebel fronts against Gaddafi forces . In the east around the ports of Misrata and Brega , fighting had been bogged down in recent weeks while the western rebels have advanced . Zawiyah lies less than 50 km west of Tripoli , on the main road to Tunisia , which has been a lifeline for Libya but has begun to crack down on rampant smuggling of gasoline . Rebels in the Western Mountains can muster a few thousand men if their separate units join forces . In Misrata , a port on the Mediterranean under rebel control for months and which lies about 580 km west of Brega , six rebel fighters were killed in fighting on Friday . Three rebels were killed west of the city where they are fighting to capture Zlitan , a town 160 km east of Tripoli . Three other rebels were killed in battles with Gaddafi forces in the town of Tawargha , east of Misrata . On the diplomatic front , a Tunisian government official said on Friday there had been contacts last week between U.S. envoys and Gaddafi representatives on Tunisian soil . The official , who declined to be named , gave no further details . U.S. officials met Gaddafi representatives last month to deliver a message that the embattled Libyan leader must go . In an effort to pile economic and military pressure on Gaddafi , more countries are set to announce next week that they will free frozen assets for the rebels , a British official said . `` While it 's hard to predict when this will end , it 's easy to see the pressure is building on Gaddafi and it is only a matter of time before he 's forced to leave power , '' the official said . Britain is playing a leading role in NATO air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces , which have weakened his armory but have not enabled the rebels to deliver a knockout blow . Tightening the economic noose around Gaddafi , Tunisia said on Thursday its troops were patrolling fuel stations to curb the flow of smuggled gasoline into neighboring Libya . International sanctions and the effects of Libya 's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of fuel to parts of the country under Gaddafi 's control , but huge volumes of gasoline are instead being smuggled across the Libyan-Tunisian border . `` The armed forces are now conducting checks at fuel stations in the south of Tunisia ... so that neither Tunisians nor Libyans can fill up with large quantities , '' Tunisian Defense Ministry official Mokhtar Ben Nasr told a news conference . `` These checks are aimed at preventing the smuggling of diesel and gasoline to Libya .

Full Article Gaddafi forces fire Scud missile : U.S. official BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue Aug 16 , 2011 5:46 pm IST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fired a Scud missile for the first time in the country 's civil war , a U.S. defense official said , after rebel advances left the Libyan leader isolated in his capital . Rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule seized two strategic towns near Tripoli over the past two days , cutting the city off from its supply lines and leaving the Libyan leader with a dwindling set of options if he is to stay in power . However , pro-Gaddafi forces were encountering a fight-back in one of those towns , Zawiyah , west of Tripoli . A Reuters reporter nearby said he heard a salvo of four Russian-made Grad rockets landing in the town on Tuesday . The Scud missile was fired on Sunday morning from a location about 50 miles -LRB- 80 km -RRB- east of Sirte , Gaddafi 's home town , and landed east of the coastal oil town of Brega where rebels are fighting for control , the U.S. official said . The missile came down in the desert , injuring no one , said the official , who was speaking on condition of anonymity . There was no immediate comment from the government in Tripoli . Firing the missile , which poses little military threat because it is so inaccurate , is evidence of the Gaddafi administration 's desperation , said Shashank Joshi , Associate Fellow at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute . `` It 's an obvious sign that the regime 's back is to the wall , '' he said . In the six months of fighting up to now , Gaddafi 's forces have been using short-range Grad rockets but have not before deployed Scud missiles , which have an estimated range of about 185 miles -LRB- 300 km -RRB- . In the rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Benghazi , officials said the Scud firing was a sign Gaddafi would do anything to protect his power . `` Gaddafi troops are using his last gun . He 's crazy , '' said Mohammad Zawawi , media director for rebel forces . `` We 're scared he 'll use chemicals . That 's why we 're trying to end this war and we hope to end it with the least number of casualties . '' `` We ca n't prevent the scuds but we hope NATO can . NATO has the technology to detect them . '' Analysts say the rebels ' strategy now is to isolate the capital and hope the government will collapse , but they say it is possible too that Gaddafi will opt to stage a last-ditch fight for the capital . In a barely audible telephone call to state television in the early hours of Monday morning , Gaddafi called on his followers to liberate Libya from rebels and their NATO supporters . `` Get ready for the fight ... The blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield , '' he said . He was speaking as rebels made their most dramatic advances in months of fighting , shifting the momentum in a conflict that had been largely static and was testing the patience of NATO powers anxious for a swift outcome . Rebel forces in the Western Mountains south of Tripoli surged forward at the weekend to enter Zawiyah . The town is about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and , crucially , straddles the main highway linking the capital to Tunisia . A day later , rebels said they had captured the town of Garyan , which controls the highway leading south from Tripoli and linking it to Sabha , a Gaddafi stronghold deep in the desert . `` Gaddafi has been isolated . He has been cut off from the outside world , '' a rebel spokesman from the Western Mountains , called Abdulrahman , told Reuters by telephone . Early on Tuesday , rebels on the outskirts of Zawiyah said forces loyal to Gaddafi were still on the eastern edge of the town , from where they have been attacking with mortars , Grad rockets and sniper fire . Medical workers at one of the town 's hospitals said 20 people , a mixture of rebel fighters and civilians , were killed on Monday , and the death toll for Tuesday had reached one . Officials in Tripoli deny Zawiyah is under rebel control , but government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim acknowledged on state television that rebel fighters were in Garyan . `` There are still armed gangs inside the city . We are able to drive them out , '' he said . A U.N. envoy arrived in neighbouring Tunisia , where sources say rebels and representatives of the government have been holed up on the island resort of Djerba for negotiations . Tunisia 's official news agency on Tuesday quoted the envoy , Abdel Elah al-Khatib , as saying he knew nothing of any negotiations in Djerba . Speaking in Tunis , he said he held informal talks with representatives of Gaddafi 's government and the rebel council . The envoy did not say who they were or what they discussed . Gaddafi 's spokesman denied Tripoli was in talks about the leader 's departure , saying reports of such negotiations were the product of a `` media war '' being waged against Libya . Talks could signal the endgame of a civil war that has drawn in the NATO alliance and emerged as one of the bloodiest confrontations in the wave of unrest sweeping the Arab world . Rebels may still lack the manpower for an all-out assault on Tripoli , but are hoping their encirclement of the capital will bring down Gaddafi 's government or inspire an uprising . In the past , however , they have frequently failed to hold gains , and a fightback by Gaddafi troops could yet force them back . Pro-Gaddafi residents of the capital remain defiant . Makhjoub Muftah , a school teacher who has signed up as a gun-toting pro-Gaddafi volunteer , like many others seemed to think a rebel advance into Tripoli was a remote possibility . `` I wish they would march into Tripoli . I wish , '' he said , daring the rebels . `` They will all die .

Libya 's key oil production and export facilities are on the front line as rebel forces advance towards the capital of Tripoli and draw close to recapturing strategic assets in the key oil ports of Marsa El Brega and Zawiyah . As the battle for control of Libya enters what may be its final phase , much of the country 's oil output could be resurrected within months if peace can be established , industry executives and analysts say . Although it will struggle to return to pre-war output for the foreseeable future , output of as much as 1 million bpd could be feasible within months , they say . Much will depend on the damage done to infrastructure and equipment in the last stages of the fighting between forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi and rebels , backed by NATO , trying to end his 41 years of rule . Libyan rebels said this week they had seized two strategic towns near Tripoli in quick succession , completing the encirclement of the capital and possibly heralding a period of more intense fighting across the country . If Gaddafi and his allies quickly move to negotiate an end to fighting , damage to infrastructure could be minimized . But even if Gaddafi avoids a bloody finish , his departure could usher in a new period of instability and uncertainty . Analysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition is riven by internal division , which could prompt new fighting after Gaddafi has been removed from power , jeopardising both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . Following are details of Libya 's oil industry , production and assessments of how long it may take to restore output . PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS \\* Until the beginning of this year , OPEC member Libya was the world 's 17th-largest oil producer and Africa 's third-largest . It holds the continent 's largest crude oil reserves . It sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe . \\* Oil production was equivalent to about 2 percent of global consumption , but fighting and social disruption have cut this to less than 100,000 bpd , and exports have stopped altogether . Many oilfields are dependent on foreign workers , who have almost all left the country . \\* Most of Libya 's oilfields are around the Sirte Basin , which contains around 80 percent of its proven reserves and spans the front line between rebel and government forces . Many other key parts of the country 's oil industry are still held by forces loyal to Gaddafi . \\* Libya has six major oil export terminals , listed with loading volumes for January from the IEA . The condition of these facilities now is not clear : - Es Sider -LRB- 447,000 bpd -RRB- - Marsa El Brega -LRB- 51,000 bpd -RRB- - Ras Lanuf -LRB- 195,000 bpd -RRB- - Tobruk -LRB- 51,000 bpd -RRB- - Zueitina -LRB- 214,000 bpd -RRB- - Zawiyah -LRB- 199,000 bpd -RRB- - other unspecified terminals -LRB- 333,000 bpd -RRB- DAMAGE \\* Damage to infrastructure was reported to be light during the first few months of fighting as both sides hoped to take full control of the country 's oil industry . In March , officials said the terminals of Ras Lanuf , Zueitina and Es Sider had suffered only minor damage during fighting and some other oil towns had been left untouched . \\* But damage has increased as fighting has continued . A rebel spokesman said on Aug. 15 that Gaddafi 's troops planned to destroy the oil terminal in Brega , still held by fighters loyal to the government , to prevent it from falling into opposition hands . Rebels say Gaddafi 's forces sabotaged two large oil tanks over the weekend , which have been sending up clouds of smoke . Brega refinery was reported to be still intact but could be a target , rebels said . \\* It has not been possible to independently confirm reports of damage being done to oil installations , an accusation rebels have previously levelled at government forces . LIBYAN OIL COMPANIES \\* Libya 's oil industry was formerly run by the state National Oil Co , which accounted for around 50 percent of the country 's output . \\* Since fighting began , the Libyan National Council , with the help of Qatar has been able to export a minimal amount of crude oil in the form of two partially laden tankers . The oil for these cargoes was reported previously to have been in storage . One of these cargoes went to a U.S. refinery and the other to Italy . No exports have been reported for several weeks . \\* It is not clear how the oil industry will be structured after the war , but it may be placed in the hands of the Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- , a company now run by Libyan rebels . RESTORATION - ANALYSTS ' VIEWS \\* A Reuters poll of 20 analysts and industry officials last month forecast it would take up to one year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd but up to two years to get back to pre-civil war levels of 1.6 million bpd . \\* The longest forecast for a full recovery of oil output came from David Wech , head of research at Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy . He said a return to full output capacity could take three to four years because significant investment in infrastructure would be necessary . \\* Oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie says it will take around 36 months for the country to recover its full production capacity , from whenever the crisis is resolved . It estimates that substantial oil volumes could be back in the market by late 2012 if a resolution is achieved by the end of 2011 . But the recovery period will extend if production remains shut-in for longer , as infrastructure continues to deteriorate . \\* Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East & North Africa energy analyst with IHS Energy , said oil output could theoretically be restored in 18 months but that this would be the most optimistic scenario . \\* `` Once there is a degree of security for their personnel , it should not take too long for the oil firms to get their workers back in . If the money 's right they will go back , '' said Mike Wittner , Societe Generale head of oil market research in New York . But it was difficult to assess how much damage had been done to oil facilities during the war , he said . `` No one really has a clear idea of how much damage to the oil infrastructure there has been ... Anytime you shut a field down quickly and run off in a panic there will be problems . '' FOREIGN OIL COMPANIES \\* Foreign oil firms , essential for the quick resumption of production , have spoken to rebels at length , but the future of existing contracts with Gaddafi 's government is uncertain . \\* Italian producer ENI , present in Libya since the 1950s , is the biggest foreign oil company there , producing 270,000 boed -LRB- barrels of oil equivalent per day -RRB- in 2010 . Its contracts are in force to 2042 for oil production , but it is not yet clear if they would be honored by any future government . \\* The total equity share of the following foreign companies -- many of which operated fields on behalf of Libya 's National Oil Co -- amounted to almost 500,000 bpd before the conflict began . The legal status of contracts after the civil war will need to be clarified .

Libya 's rebels said on Tuesday they had completed moves to cut off roads to the capital after rapid advances in the west . The defection of a senior Gaddafi security official further reinforced the image of crumbling central authority . But analysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition , too , remains riven by internal division that could prompt new fighting , jeopardizing both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . While sources say members of the opposition and government have held secret meetings in Tunisia that also involve a U.N. envoy , many doubt Gaddafi and his sons would cede power even with a guarantee of immunity from international prosecution . Even his death might not end his family 's influence . `` Gaddafi will have plenty of tricks up his sleeves until his very last breath , '' said Hayat Alvi , lecturer in Middle Eastern politics at the U.S. Naval War College . `` He will have instructed his sons and circle of loyalists -- especially those remaining in the security services -- to plant as many obstacles in the rebels ' and transitional government 's paths as possible , even in his absence . '' The rebels and NATO may hope an uprising or coup in Tripoli would let them enter the city without the kind of street battle that would challenge the skills of both rebels and Western air forces . But not everyone believes such an outcome is likely . `` Unrest in Tripoli remains limited to small scale bouts of localized unrest and shortages during Ramadan caused by the opposition 's militias could fuel resentment against them rather than the regime , '' said Henry Smith , Libya analyst for risk consultancy Control Risks . Having initially hoped a flurry of NATO air strikes would be enough to oust Gaddafi , the mood in many Western capitals darkened the point of outright pessimism as the war dragged on . Recent rebel military success might make it easier for NATO states to extend their military campaign when they next meet on August 31 , but longer term worries are already building . The killing last month of Abdel Fattah Younes , military chief for the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , by rival rebels further strengthened views of Gaddafi 's opponents in the east as divided among themselves . Rebels in the west -- who have made most of the recent military gains -- have also openly voiced dissatisfaction with the lack of progress made by the Benghazi-based eastern bloc . Oil firms in particular worry that even a relatively easy end to the war could simply set the stage for more chaos . At worst , they fear a collapse into a new and more complex civil war . At the very least , bureaucratic and political infighting could make a return to prewar business impossible . `` The place will not necessarily become more peaceful if Gaddafi goes , '' said one Western risk consultant advising several major firms on Libya investments . `` You will have ex-Gaddafi people , the NTC and expats from the trading families returning , '' he said . `` And they will be at each other 's throats . '' A July report from oil specialists Wood Mackenzie estimated that even after a possible overthrow of Gaddafi it could take around 36 months for Libya to resume full oil production of 1.6 million barrels per day , roughly 2 percent of global output . Even with the swift lifting of international sanctions , many oil firms look likely to hang back from sending in teams to restart old projects or from investigating new ones . `` Even if Gaddafi does go it will be far from a smooth transition , '' said one oil executive and security specialist . `` Remove a dictator and destroy his security apparatus and you are left with a scenario remarkably like Iraq , and look how long that has taken . '' Saddam Hussein was overthrown more than eight years ago , but the country remains very troubled . Western governments too also seem reluctant to plunge deeper into greater involvement in a post-Gaddafi Libya . Sources with knowledge of post-war planning say some has taken place , but it is largely limited to a relatively few civilian officials . With Western powers exhausted by Iraq and Afghanistan and now dealing with economic crisis and perhaps even a rising risk of civil unrest at home , few believe they have the appetite for large peacekeeping missions that could last years . While Libya does not have the same Sunni-Shi ` ite sectarian division that rendered post-Saddam Iraq such a tinderbox , it does have complex tribal divisions that could fuel conflict . Some suspect that even after a Gaddafi departure it could remain effectively somewhat divided into east and west along ancient provincial boundaries . But physical conflict and further damage to oil facilities is not the only worry for oil firms who spent years courting Gaddafi to gain access to the country . In the potentially febrile atmosphere of postwar Libya , they fear massive renegotiation of contracts and the digging up of old secrets . `` The biggest threat to oil firms is that the new regime will inevitably try to investigate who paid what to secure contracts with Gaddafi , '' said the anonymous political risk consultant . `` The firms will either have to pay again or face the risk of information being disclosed publicly and potentially ending up in courts in Europe and the U.S. '' -LRB- Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov ; editing by Alastair Macdonald -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Love or hate Gaddafi , there is no doubting he has majority backing from tribes . Regardless of how people feel , the real cost of this war is yet to come . Because without security , no foreign contractor -LRB- oil or otherwise -RRB- can return a profit from Libya ventures . So what 's the plan ? There really is n't one , is there ? Gaddafi has never been anything than a mad tyrant . He oppressed the berber tribes ; banned them to speak their own language , having their old culture . He sponsored terrorism inside and outside of Libya . Killings , rapes , corruption , unemployment , suffering . He killed hundreds of innocent people blowing 3 airplanes . He tortured his own people , he stolen money from Libya . There is nothing good about Gaddafi . Only someone with absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of Libya would say he has been a good person . Any Quaddafi actions pale in comparison to the plunder NATO nations inflicted on Africa , and the rest of the world in form of slave trade , colonization and today through neo-colonization . It is true that traitors existed in the past and still exist . They ally with invaders to sell off the sovereignty , citizens and wealth in exchange for modern ammunition and some candy . So to expect anything from NATO after the destruction of a country is day dreaming . A weak Libya is easier to plunder , this will be enabled more by the rag-tag rebels in power plus in fighting or squabbles that are sure to follow Quaddafi 's exit due to NATO\\/UN bombs use to impose a puppet regime installed over Libyans with NATO bombs over the heads UN\\/NATO\\/Libyan opposition could have done better . AU and Libyan Govt so far have been the sensible parties . Turkey , Qatar and Arab league have betrayed Libyans by supporting the war instead of promoting peace to gain cheap favor from the west , especially European Union . This discussion is now closed .

Asked about reports of secret negotiations at the weekend on the Tunisian resort island of Djerba , Mustafa Abdel Jalil denied any back-channel communications with Gaddafi . `` I would like to affirm that the NTC has no knowledge and no backing of these talks ... Any political consultations or contacts should be done through or with the council , '' he said . The NTC has consistently denied any bid to broker a compromise deal with the Libyan leader , insisting that after 41 years in power he must simply quit and leave or be ousted by force . A Gaddafi government spokesman also denied negotiating with the rebel leadership . The U.N. special envoy trying to find a way to end the conflict in Libya , Abdel Elah al-Khatib , was scheduled to meet senior Tunisian representatives on Monday . A foreign ministry spokesman in Tunis on Sunday said he would also `` certainly ... meet the Libyan parties '' . Khatib has met on several occasions with representatives of Gaddafi and the rebels . His visit to the region was his first since rebel advances cut Tripoli off from its supply route to Tunisia , shifting momentum in the rebels ' favor . Reports of secret talks in Djerba coincided with the apparent defection of a senior figure in Gaddafi 's security apparatus , who flew from Djerba to Cairo with his family on Monday . At about the same time , rebel forces in the Western Mountains reported significant breakthroughs in the six-month-old conflict , taking the strategic city of Zawiyah on the coast and securing the key crossroads town of Garyan in the desert south of Tripoli . The advances buoyed the rebel movement and prompted analysts to speculate that the noose is tightening around Gaddafi 's stronghold in the Libyan capital and that his days in power may be numbered . -LRB- Reporting by Robert Birsel ; Writing by Christian Lowe and Douglas Hamilton -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "302", "dct": "2011-08-17", "dates": ["2011-06-02", "2011-08-17", "2011-08-17", "2011-02-01", "2011-03-01", "1990-01-01"], "text": "A couple arrive at Shousha camp , which was constructed by the Tunisian army to house African refugees coming from Libya , at the Ras Jdir border crossing in Tunisia , June 2 , 2011 . RAS JIDR , Tunisia | Wed Aug 17 , 2011 2:57 am EDT RAS JIDR , Tunisia -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Five months after Sudanese worker Mohammed Hassan fled civil war in Libya he is still stranded in a tent city just across the border in Tunisia . `` In my own country there is a conflict and violence . I can not go there so where do I go now ? '' said Mohammed , who comes from Sudan 's troubled Darfur region . He left years ago for Libya to escape violence at home . The United Nations says almost 900,000 people , including 200,000 foreign workers , have fled Libya into Tunisia to escape fighting after rebels launched an uprising against the 41-year-rule of Muammar Gaddafi in February . African workers in particular were frequently targeted by Gaddafi 's opponents , who sometimes accused them of working for the government as mercenaries . Most of the Libyans have gone back home or have found new places to stay , and most of the foreigners have been sent home to their countries of origin . But around 4,000 of the foreigners , like Mohammed , can not go home because of war or danger in their own countries , and have remained for months in this camp near the border , stateless and unsure of their future . In March , Mohammed made his way to Ras Jidr , the main gateway between Libya and Tunisia . He has been staying in a tent city just behind the border post . `` I came with my family to Libya because life in Darfur was bad . It 's still bad there . There is no stability , '' he said , sitting on a mat with fellow Sudanese refugees . More than two million people have left their homes in Darfur after the government started a campaign against non-Arab rebels there . Fighting has ebbed from peak levels but there is no end to the conflict in the region , which borders eastern Libya . With the help of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR , Mohammed has filed a request for asylum . So far few Western countries have signalled a willingness to accept stranded Africans from the border camps , U.N. officials say . `` We are conducting interviews on an individual case basis and trying to speed up the process but it takes time , '' said Rocco Nuri , a spokesman for UNHCR in Tunisia . Many others in the camp share the same fate , sitting in front of their white tents or under trees by the main road to the border . `` I came to Benghazi to study but I do n't know what to do now , '' said another young Sudanese man from South Kordofan , a region which has seen fighting recently between the army and fighters allied to newly-independent South Sudan . The early days of the conflict in Libya saw chaos at the border and a massive effort to prevent humanitarian disaster . The camps in Tunisia were overcrowded at the start , with fights breaking out between refugees waiting for hours for food or water . Tensions ran high between refugees from areas at conflict with each other , such as Sudanese from Darfur and the capital Khartoum . Some governments such as Egypt sent planes to fetch their stranded citizens . Half a million Libyans returned home , according to the UNHCR . The rest have largely scattered . The 4,000 Africans who remain , segregated by nationalities , live in tents exposed to the sun in the open plain . `` The location is unfortunate because it is close to the border and very hot , '' said Nuri . Most have applied for asylum in Western countries . Some have no money to go home or no plan of where to go . `` I came to Libya in 1990 to work first as a factory worker and have done several other jobs since then , '' said Omar from Ivory Coast . `` I do n't know what to do now , '' he said , before heading to his tent . While he enjoyed living and making good money in Libya , he said going back to Libya is not an option . `` It got impossible to stay in Libya , not just because of the security but the attacks against black people , '' he said . Abdulrahman , also from Darfur , said he had been accused by both Gaddafi supporters and rebels of fighting for the other side . `` We 're in the middle of accusations from both sides .

Turkish leaders , who once backed Assad , are sounding increasingly frustrated with the Syrian leader in the same way they became frustrated with Muammar Gaddafi after trying to mediate in the Libyan civil war . `` We have done our best on Libya , but have n't been able to generate any results . So it 's an international issue now . Gaddafi could not meet our expectations , and the outcome was obvious , '' Erdogan told reporters . `` Now the same situation is going on in Syria . I 've sent my foreign minister , and personally got in touch many times , the last of them three days ago on the phone . In spite of all this , civilians are still getting killed , '' he said . Erdogan repeatedly contacted Gaddafi after the Libyan uprising began in February , calling for a ceasefire and for Gaddafi to allow a transition of power . In June , Erdogan offered him an unspecified guarantee if he left Libya but received no answer . Since then Turkey has stepped up support for the Libyan rebels , increasing shipments of diesel to them . Syrian troops raided houses in a Sunni district of the besieged port of Latakia on Wednesday , residents said , arresting hundreds of people and taking them to a stadium after a four-day tank assault to crush protests against Assad . Rights organizations say at least 1,700 civilians have been killed by security forces since the protests erupted in March , while Syrian authorities say terrorist groups have killed 500 soldiers and police . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu also called again on Wednesday for Syria to end military operations but he has ruled out foreign intervention in Turkey 's southern neighbor . `` The bloodshed has to stop , first and foremost . The military operations have to stop , '' Davutoglu told a news conference with his Jordanian counterpart Nasser Judeh . `` If the operations continue in Syria and the operations become a regional problem Turkey can naturally not remain indifferent . '' Asked about a news report that Turkey might create a buffer zone along its border with Syria , Davutoglu said : `` We 're talking about a border that is 900 km long . We can not talk about such a development right now , '' he said . Turkish officials denied on Tuesday the report that Ankara was planning a buffer zone to prevent an influx of refugees . With Assad defying international pressure and Syrian refugees crossing over the border into Turkey , media have previously said that Turkish political and military leaders were considering setting up a buffer zone inside Syria . Relations between Syria and Turkey , its imperial ruler until World War One , have often been tense . The two countries almost went to war in the 1990s when Turkish forces were battling Kurdish rebels operating from bases inside Syria . -LRB- Reporting by Ibon Villelabeitia and Ece Toksabay ; writing by Daren Butler ; editing by David Stamp -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

A convoy of rebels entered a western neighborhood of the city , firing their weapons into the air . Rebels said the whole of the city was under their control except Gaddafi 's Bab Al-Aziziya-Jazeera stronghold , according to al-Jazeera Television . Gaddafi made two audio addresses over state television calling on Libyans to fight off the rebels . `` I am afraid if we do n't act , they will burn Tripoli , '' he said . `` There will be no more water , food , electricity or freedom . '' Gaddafi , a colorful and often brutal autocrat who has ruled Libya for over 40 years , said he was breaking out weapons stores to arm the population . His spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , predicted a violent reckoning by the rebels . `` A massacre will be committed inside Tripoli if one side wins now , because the rebels have come with such hatred , such vendetta ... Even if the leader leaves or steps down now , there will be a massacre . '' NATO , which has backed the rebels with a bombing campaign , said the transition of power in Libya must be peaceful . After a six-month civil war , the fall of Tripoli came quickly , with a carefully orchestrated uprising launched on Saturday night to coincide with the advance of rebel troops on three fronts . Fighting broke out after the call to prayer from the minarets of the mosques . Rebel National Transitional Council Coordinator Adel Dabbechi confirmed that Gaddafi 's younger son Saif Al-Islam had been captured . His eldest son Mohammed Al-Gaddafi had surrendered to rebel forces , he told Reuters . Only five months ago Gaddafi 's forces were set to crush the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , the leader warning in a television address that there would be `` no mercy , no pity '' for his opponents . His forces , he said , would hunt them down `` district to district , street to street , house to house , room to room . '' The United Nations then acted quickly , clearing the way for creation of a no-fly zone that NATO , with a campaign of bombing , used ultimately to help drive back Gaddafi 's forces . `` It 's over . Gaddafi 's finished , '' said Saad Djebbar , former legal adviser to Libyan government . Al Jazeera television aired images of people celebrating in central Tripoli and tearing down posters of Gaddafi , which had dominated Libyan cities for decades . In Benghazi in the east , thousands gathered in a city-center square waving red , black and green opposition flag as news filtered through of rebel advances into Tripoli . `` It 's over ! '' shouted one man as he dashed out of a building , a mobile telephone clutched to his ear . Celebratory gunfire and explosions rang out over the city and cars blaring their horns crowded onto the streets . Overhead , red tracer bullets darted into a black sky . `` It does look like it is coming to an end , '' said Anthony Skinner , Middle East analyst , Maplecroft . `` But there are still plenty of questions . The most important is exactly what Gaddafi does now . Does he flee or can he fight ? '' `` In the slightly longer term , what happens next ? We know there have been some serious divisions between the rebel movement and we do n't know yet if they will be able to form a cohesive front to run the country . '' Gaddafi , in his second audio broadcast in 24 hours , dismissed the rebels as rats . `` I am giving the order to open the weapons stockpiles , '' Gaddafi said . `` I call on all Libyans to join this fight . Those who are afraid , give your weapons to your mothers or sisters . `` Go out , I am with you until the end . I am in Tripoli . We will ... win . '' A Libyan government official told Reuters that 376 people on both sides of the conflict were killed in fighting overnight on Saturday in Tripoli , with about 1,000 others wounded . A diplomatic source in Paris , where the government has closely backed the rebels , said underground rebel cells in the capital had been following detailed plans drawn up months ago and had been waiting for a signal to act .

Following are reactions from analysts and political players to the fluid events unfolding in Libya following six months of fighting between rebels and Gaddafi 's forces . GEORGE JOFFE , NORTH AFRICA EXPERT AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY `` For the city to fall so easily shows that despite all the bluster of the Gaddafi regime , it had lost the confidence of the Libyan people a long time ago . `` The assault has been led by rebels from the Jebel Nafusa and Misrata and not by those from Benghazi and there is no guarantee they will accept the leadership of Benghazi . So we are entering a very dangerous phase . `` And then you still have the problem of Sirte . It has not yet been reduced . They may fight on and indeed Gaddafi may actually be there . They may not give up quite so easily . `` There are many people there who are invested in the regime and so you may have a new stage of the civil war . '' `` The rebels will want to get rid of every last vestige of the regime but I know of no effective plan or operation so far to rebuild the country . '' JOHN DRAKE , SENIOR RISK CONSULTANT , UK-BASED CONSULTANCY AKE `` Had the rebels marched into Tripoli in late February the situation would have been very different and the city may have fallen relatively quickly and easily . `` Now , after six months of fighting , the animosity between the two sides is likely to be a lot higher , so there is going to be a risk of violent retribution against those seen as having supported the regime over that time . '' ASHOUR SHAMIS , OPPOSITION ACTIVIST AND JOURNALIST `` The game is over for Gaddafi . There 's bound to be some resistance here and there but his forces seem to be falling apart . He no longer directs his men . `` I think most Libyans want his men to peacefully surrender but if they resist they will have to be fought . `` If rebel forces capture people who are wanted by The Hague court , they will have to keep them safe until they are handed over to Libyan legal authorities . `` What then happens to those persons arrested , in terms of whether they end up at The Hague court , will I think depend in part on how they conduct themselves -LRB- in custody -RRB- . '' ANTHONY SKINNER , MIDDLE EAST ANALYST , MAPLECROFT `` It does look like it is coming to an end . But there are still plenty of questions . The most important is exactly what Gaddafi does now . Does he flee or can he fight ? In the slightly longer term , what happens next ? We know there have been some serious divisions between the rebel movement and we do n't know yet if they will be able to form a cohesive front is to run the country . `` Looking further afield , it is obviously going to be very uncomfortable viewing for Assad in Syria . Obviously they are very different cases , particularly because of the outside military involvement in Libya . But it 's another sign that when you use brutal force against protesters , you lose legitimacy . It just inflames the situation and at the end of the day we have seen another regional leader forced from power . '' DANIEL KORSKI , SENIOR FELLOW , EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS `` The next few hours are key . From Iraq we know that the first days , weeks and months are key for any long-term stability . What happens to law and order , what happens to ex-loyalists is key . The worst that could happen is the collapse of the Gaddafi regime and a huge vacuum . The West must be there to support an orderly transition , resist crowing and taking the responsibility away from the Libyans yet make clear to the rebels they must hold to standards they felt Gaddafi never met . '' MOHAMMED ABDEL MALIK , LIBYAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVIST `` Actually I 'm numb . I do n't know what to feel . We just ca n't believe it 's true . I 'm really , really so proud to be a Libyan tonight . We 're so grateful . I 'm in Cairo at the moment . We 've received calls coming in from family inside Libya . Thank God they 're safe . `` There have been many calls from the imams to the young men that they should not kill or seek vengeance , and that if they catch anyone they should hand them over to the authorities . `` This has been a very honorable and highly moral revolution . '' HAYAT ALVI , LECTURER IN MIDDLE EAST POLITICS , US NAVAL WAR COLLEGE `` If indeed the rebels finish the job today , then this will have been a swift and decisive and incredibly determined effort on the part of the rebels , and the significance of Ramadan will certainly not go understated in the eyes of many in Libya and in the Islamic world . The role of NATO in this process over the last several months will definitely be praised . `` This also signifies a milestone for the post-colonial Middle East : The longest ruling dictator has fallen . I do n't think even the ouster\\/overthrow of Ben Ali and Mubarak signaled such a symbolically significant political marker , which will reverberate in the most pronounced manner throughout the region . `` The fighting skills of the ragtag rebels in Libya will potentially inspire others as well . `` This is a momentous event . Gaddafi is history - this time not just rhetorically , but very literally . '' MANSOUR EL-KIKHIA , LIBYAN PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO `` I 'm elated .

Libya 's civil war so far has involved some serious urban fighting in towns such as Misrata , but most battles have been relatively small skirmishes . If Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi retains the loyalty of large numbers of security forces in the capital , the ragtag opposition forces could struggle and there would be little NATO air strikes could do without risking civilians . `` I 'm assuming the Tripoli fighting could be the fiercest , '' said Hayat Alvi , lecturer in Middle East politics at the United States Naval War College . `` The wild card will be the Tripoli public . True loyalties will have to finally manifest themselves . I 'm predicting in the rebels ' favor , but we do n't know what Gaddafi and his sons have up their sleeves . '' Gauging the loyalty of Tripoli 's population is far from easy . Gaddafi loyalists have put on many marches and demonstrations of loyalty in recent months , but hundreds if not thousands of his opponents also took to the streets in the early stages of the uprising before they were cowed . The rebels will hope security forces will melt away . Some say Gaddafi himself might already have fled , perhaps to his hometown of Sirte or a desert base further south . The long speeches at boisterous public meetings have given way to broadcast addresses delivered on scratchy telephone lines . But others say the nascent uprising reported in Tripoli on Saturday night might have come too soon , with opposition forces still too far away to help . Despite rhetoric of taking Tripoli and ending the war in hours or days , some analysts suspect it is more likely the rebels will cement their stranglehold on the city and then see how events play out . `` I think they 'll wait on the outskirts and hope for either an uprising or that Gaddafi decided to call it a day and leaves , '' said David Hartwell , Middle East analyst for IHS Jane 's . `` If they do go in , they could find it very difficult and they will be keen to avoid that . It 's relatively obvious that NATO has been providing close air support for the rebels . `` That 's one thing in open countryside or lightly populated areas -- although it pushes the Security Council mandate , to put it mildly -- but it would be almost impossible in Tripoli . '' Gaddafi 's government seems keen to broker some kind of last-minute ceasefire that would keep them in power . But few believe either the rebels or NATO would agree to that at this stage . In Paris , a diplomatic source said rebel cells undercover in Tripoli were putting into action plans prepared months ago . He said , however , the rebels were under orders not to enact revenge killings or summary executions against senior members of Gaddafi 's camp . Saad Djebbar , a former lawyer for the Libyan government , told Reuters he believed many key figures loyal to Gaddafi had already fled to other countries in Africa such as Niger , Mali and Chad where they had good contacts . `` The big sharks have already left the scene , he said . `` It 's not going to be Stalingrad . Tripoli is very small . People know each other . People negotiate their way forward . Gaddafi is bound to have some people who will put up a symbolic fight . But these are mostly thugs and there is no organized force left of any size to check the rebels . '' If the rebels are wrong and significant Gaddafi forces remain , strategists say they could be in serious trouble . Urban warfare is notoriously challenging and bloody , giving a clear advantage to the defender , while some doubt the opposition have sufficient supply lines to sustain an offensive . `` The costliness of urban fighting can not be overestimated , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor in a note . `` Such warfare requires a well-trained force with high morale , and the rebel forces in the west are known to be few in number ... and extremely ill-trained . '' The key battle now , Stratfor said , was psychological -- with the rebel agenda to paint a picture of inevitable victory that would enthuse new uprisings and prompt Gaddafi loyalists to abandon their cause to save their necks . Much , of course , will depend on how Gaddafi himself chooses to play the endgame . He could still perhaps go into either internal or external exile or simply try to copy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and disappear into the post-war chaos . Saddam evaded U.S. forces for months following the 2003 fall of Baghdad before they eventually tracked him down -- although most analysts believe such a scheme would prove tougher in Libya because of its more disparate geography . Even if opposition forces were able to take much of Tripoli relatively easily and bloodlessly , they might still struggle to take down the final remnants of the regime . Then , the situation could resemble that seen earlier this year in Ivory Coast , where opposition fighters loyal to Alassane Ouattara took much of the capital Abidjan but seemed unable to capture incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo . It took the actions of French helicopter gunships and troops already based in the country to eventually breach his compound and bunker , allowing his capture by local forces . The International Criminal Court in The Hague indicted Gadaffi , his eldest son and spy chief for crimes committed during their initial crackdown . That might yet prompt foreign military action to help the rebels capture him . `` I would have thought NATO would be very keen let the rebels get Gaddafi themselves as they possibly can , '' said IHS Jane 's Hartwell . `` But if it really came down to getting him out of a hole , you could see some Western involvement as we did in Abidjan . The ICC warrant could make it justifiable in that context . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . They can simply cut off Tripoli from gasoline and electricity and wait . There seems to be enthusiasm in western media for the regime 's collapse , and this irrationally translates proximity of rebel forces to Tripoli into their imminent success . The regime seems poised to fall , but it wo n't come from gun-toting , untrained , western-backed rebels on the capitol 's fringes . The regime will fall when there is a mass popular uprising in the city , and when deals have been struck between high-level military leaders and -LRB- mostly external -RRB- parties that have an interest in the regime 's collapse . No patriot can give up a throne without a strong fight . NATO 's approach was lopsided and propelled a rebel group to try and take over so that NATO has puppets in power . Greed , barbarism led NATO to twist the UN mandate . The leaders in NATO countries could not allow for a better solution , they seem to have no regard for casualties of African or third world countries as long as the strategic interest of the west and achieved . NATO must let Libyans settle there own problems without ludicrous foreign interference with bombs .

But with opposition fighters now in control of most parts of the capital , Tripoli , and the battle for control of the country probably in its final phase , industry executives and analysts say much of the country 's oil output could be resurrected within months if peace can be established quickly . Although it will struggle to return to pre-war output for the foreseeable future , output of as much as 1 million bpd could be feasible within months , they say . Much will depend on the damage done to infrastructure and equipment in the last stages of the fighting between forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his 41 years of rule . An official working for Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- , which has been operating the Sarir and Mesla oilfields under rebel control , said on Friday that output from its area could resume within three weeks . `` Our fields are under maintenance and we 're still waiting for security , '' Abdeljalil Mayouf , information manager at AGOCO told Reuters . `` When the security is OK we will start . Perhaps two or three weeks after the improvement in security . In three weeks maybe . '' But even if Gaddafi avoids a bloody finish , his departure could usher in a new period of instability and uncertainty . Analysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition is riven by internal division , which could prompt new fighting after Gaddafi has been removed from power , jeopardizing both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . War and other traumas in oil producing nations have typically had a lasting impact on output . The speed of recovery in oil output depends crucially on how quickly international companies with highly evolved skills can be brought in . Following are details of Libya 's oil industry , production and assessments of how long it may take to restore output . \\* Until the beginning of this year , OPEC member Libya was the world 's 17th-largest oil producer and Africa 's third-largest . It holds the continent 's largest crude oil reserves . It sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe . \\* Oil production was equivalent to about 2 percent of global consumption , but fighting and social disruption have cut this to less than 100,000 bpd , and exports have stopped altogether . Many oilfields are dependent on foreign workers , who have almost all left the country . \\* Most of Libya 's oilfields are around the Sirte Basin , which contains around 80 percent of its proven reserves and spans the front line between rebel and government forces . Many other key parts of the country 's oil industry are still held by forces loyal to Gaddafi . \\* Libya has six major oil export terminals , listed with loading volumes for January from the IEA . The condition of these facilities now is not clear : - Es Sider -LRB- 447,000 bpd -RRB- - Ras Lanuf -LRB- 195,000 bpd -RRB- \\* Damage to infrastructure was reported to be light during the first few months of fighting as both sides hoped to take full control of the country 's oil industry . In March , officials said the terminals of Ras Lanuf , Zueitina and Es Sider had suffered only minor damage during fighting and some other oil towns had been left untouched . \\* But damage has increased as fighting has continued and rebels have reported significant damage to oil infrastructure this month . It has not been possible to independently confirm reports of damage being done to oil installations , an accusation rebels have previously leveled at government forces . \\* Libya 's oil industry was formerly run by the state National Oil Co , which accounted for around 50 percent of the country 's output . \\* Since fighting began , the Libyan National Council , with the help of Qatar has been able to export a minimal amount of crude oil in the form of two partially laden tankers . The oil for these cargoes was reported previously to have been in storage . One of these cargoes went to a U.S. refinery and the other to Italy . No exports have been reported for several weeks . \\* It is not clear how the oil industry will be structured after the war , but it may be placed in the hands of AGOCO . \\* A Reuters poll of 20 analysts and industry officials last month forecast it would take up to one year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd but up to two years to get back to pre-civil war levels of 1.6 million bpd . \\* The longest forecast for a full recovery of oil output came from David Wech , head of research at Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy . He said a return to full output capacity could take three to four years because significant investment in infrastructure would be necessary . \\* Oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it would take around 36 months for the country to recover its full production capacity , from whenever the crisis is resolved . It estimates that substantial oil volumes could be back in the market by late 2012 if a resolution is achieved by the end of 2011 . But the recovery period will extend if production remains shut-in for longer , as infrastructure continues to deteriorate . \\* Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East & North Africa energy analyst with IHS Energy , said oil output could theoretically be restored in 18 months but that this would be the most optimistic scenario . \\* `` Once there is a degree of security for their personnel , it should not take too long for the oil firms to get their workers back in . If the money 's right they will go back , '' said Mike Wittner , Societe Generale head of oil market research in New York . But it was difficult to assess how much damage had been done to oil facilities during the war , he said . `` No one really has a clear idea of how much damage to the oil infrastructure there has been ... Anytime you shut a field down quickly and run off in a panic there will be problems . '' \\* Foreign oil firms , essential for the quick resumption of production , have spoken to rebels at length , but the future of existing contracts with Gaddafi 's government is uncertain . \\* Italian producer ENI , present in Libya since the 1950s , is the biggest foreign oil company there , producing 270,000 boed -LRB- barrels of oil equivalent per day -RRB- in 2010 . Its contracts are in force to 2042 for oil production , but it is not yet clear if they would be honored by any future government . \\* The total equity share of the following foreign companies -- many of which operated fields on behalf of Libya 's National Oil Co -- amounted to almost 500,000 bpd before the conflict began . The legal status of contracts after the civil war will need to be clarified . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

NEW YORK | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 4:46 pm BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brent crude fell more than 1 percent on Monday as investors anticipated a resumption of oil exports from the OPEC-member Libya , where rebels moved to control most of Tripoli and an end to the 6-month-old civil war seemed close . Libyan government tanks and snipers put up scattered resistance in Tripoli after rebels swept into the heart of the capital , cheered on by crowds hailing the end of Muammar Gaddafi 's 42 years in power . `` A resolution of the conflict is modestly bearish for crude oil prices , but it is less likely that we will get a $ 10 - $ 20 drop in price of crude , '' Jason Schenker , president at Prestige Economics LLC in Austin , Texas , said in a note . `` While the fundamentals of the conflict resolution appear at first glance to be only bearish , it could turn out to be quite bullish , as it could engender further conflict in the region , '' Schenker said . Brent losses were limited by the dollar 's weakness . DXY and the greenback 's slip and a bounce by equities on Wall Street helped lift U.S. crude prices , for both the expiring front-month September and October contracts . The euro edged up , helped by a rise in European shares , while the dollar weakened on speculation that the Federal Reserve may show some indication this week about the need to take additional measures to support an ailing economy . ICE Brent October crude fell $ 1.25 to $ 107.37 a barrel by 11:09 a.m. -LRB- 4:09 p.m. BST -RRB- , having recover from a $ 105.15 intraday low . U.S. expiring September crude rose 84 cents to $ 83.10 a barrel , having reached as high as $ 84.30 . More actively traded October crude rose 79 cents to $ 83.20 a barrel . Brent 's premium to U.S. crude narrowed to $ 24.05 a barrel , after reaching a record $ 26.69 on Friday . Part of U.S. crude divergence from Brent is because traders are starting to bail out of their Brent\\/U . S. spread positions , said Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute . Speculators raised slightly their long exposure to Brent in the week to August 16 , data from the Intercontinental Exchange showed . Selling by `` soft longs '' who increased exposure last week and profit taking by traders with long-held positions could put more short-term pressure on Brent , according to brokers . Libya pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- , nearly 2 percent of global supply , before the war cut its output . Most of Libya 's high-quality crude flowed to European refiners . After Libyan exports ceased , tighter supply drove Brent to a two-year high of $ 127.02 in April . Production fell to almost nothing during the conflict but technical staff from Italy 's oil and gas major ENI -LRB- ENI . MI -RRB- have already arrived in Libya to look into restarting oil facilities . Some Libyan output will be able to restart in a few months , but it will take as long as 18 months to reach the prewar level , Libya 's former top oil official Shokri Ghanem said on Monday .

The implosion of Gaddafi 's rule after six months of civil war in which the rebels benefited from sanctions on Gaddafi , a no-fly zone and NATO air strikes may have implications for Syri 's six-month-old revolt and Assad 's efforts to crush it . `` The international community will now think that its strong intervention in the struggle -LRB- in Syria -RRB- will resolve the situation , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein . `` Libya has raised the morale of the West and it will have a bigger excuse to intervene . But we reject any military action in Syria . '' Hussein and other opposition activists said however the events in Tripoli would revive Syrian protesters ' hopes . `` What happened in Libya means a lot for us , it means that the Arab spring is coming without doubt ... there is no solution to any problem without the will of the people , '' said Michel Kilo , a prominent opposition figure . No country has proposed the kind of action in Syria which NATO forces have carried out in Libya . But the West has called on Assad to step down and Washington has imposed new sanctions over his crackdown , in which the United Nations says 2,200 civilians have died . Syria has an alliance with Iran and a key role in Lebanon , despite ending a 29-year military presence there in 2005 . It also has influence in Iraq and supports militant groups Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah . Assad on Sunday said Syria would not bow to external pressure , which he said could only affect `` a president made in the United States and a subservient people who get their orders from outside . '' `` As for the threat of a military action ... any action against Syria will have greater consequences -LRB- on those who carry it out -RRB- , greater than they can tolerate , '' he said . Assad has responded to the unrest with a mixture of reforms and force . He granted citizenship to hundreds of thousands of ethnic Kurds , ended a state of emergency and promised to let groups other than his Baath party run in elections . Analysts and opposition figures said they expected the situation in Syria to deteriorate further , with authorities intensifying the crackdown and protesters not backing down . `` After what happened in Libya I think he -LRB- Assad -RRB- will be tougher with the security option he is taking , '' Boumonsef said . `` He sees what -LRB- he calls -RRB- the international conspiracy on him will be stronger and now that Gaddafi is out of the way it will move toward him in full strength ... This is imminent . '' Some opposition figures expressed fears that Libya 's endgame might encourage voices among the opposition calling for the arming of a hitherto largely peaceful movement in Syria . `` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said Hussein , who was detained during the uprising . `` But we will resist such proposals , regardless of where they are coming from . '' The anti-Assad movement is fragmented . `` Despite everything that is happening , the opposition remains stuck over little issues like personal issues between its leaders , '' Kilo said . Boumonsef said it would try harder , with international help , to unify . `` The opposition will be motivated more . There is no return and -LRB- Assad 's -RRB- reforms will not stop anything . It is too late . '' Encouraged after Western leaders called on Assad to step down , Syrian opposition figures are holding talks in Istanbul to nominate a broad-based council that could aid in a transition of power if Assad is toppled . Unlike previous opposition conferences , which were marked by divisions between Islamists and liberals , participants said there was broad agreement on 120 nominees for the council from inside and outside Syria . The council would speak for dissidents in exile and activists on the ground , opposition figures told Reuters . But some poured cold water on the idea . `` There is no interest inside Syria in a conference happening outside because the public opinion and those inside Syria believe that what is happening outside is marginal , '' Kilo said . `` We do not need a transitional council ... the real challenge is not what should be done after the regime collapses but for us it is what should be done every day so that we remain standing .

The Libyan Revolution has largely succeeded , and this is a moment of celebration , not only for Libyans but for a youth generation in the Arab world that has pursued a political opening across the region . The secret of the uprising s final days of success lay in a popular revolt in the working-class districts of the capital , which did most of the hard work of throwing off the rule of secret police and military cliques . It succeeded so well that when revolutionary brigades entered the city from the west , many encountered little or no resistance , and they walked right into the center of the capital . Muammar Qaddafi was in hiding as I went to press , and three of his sons were in custody . Saif al-Islam Qaddafi had apparently been the de facto ruler of the country in recent years , so his capture signaled a checkmate . -LRB- Checkmate is a corruption of the Persian shah maat , the king is confounded , since chess came west from India via Iran -RRB- . The end game , wherein the people of Tripoli overthrew the Qaddafis and joined the opposition Transitional National Council , is the best case scenario that I had suggested was the most likely denouement for the revolution . I have been making this argument for some time , and it evoked a certain amount of incredulity when I said it in a lecture in the Netherlands in mid-June , but it has all along been my best guess that things would end the way they have . I got it right where others did not because my premises turned out to be sounder , i.e. , that Qaddafi had lost popular support across the board and was in power only through main force . Once enough of his heavy weapons capability was disrupted , and his fuel and ammunition supplies blocked , the underlying hostility of the common people to the regime could again manifest itself , as it had in February . I was moreover convinced that the generality of Libyans were attracted by the revolution and by the idea of a political opening , and that there was no great danger to national unity here . I do not mean to underestimate the challenges that still lie ahead mopping up operations against regime loyalists , reestablishing law and order in cities that have seen popular revolutions , reconstituting police and the national army , moving the Transitional National Council to Tripoli , founding political parties , and building a new , parliamentary regime . Even in much more institutionalized and less clan-based societies such as Tunisia and Egypt , these tasks have proved anything but easy . But it would be wrong , in this moment of triumph for the Libyan Second Republic , to dwell on the difficulties to come . Libyans deserve a moment of exultation . I have taken a lot of heat for my support of the revolution and of the United Nations-authorized intervention by the Arab League and NATO that kept it from being crushed . I haven t taken nearly as much heat as the youth of Misrata who fought off Qaddafi s tank barrages , though , so it is OK . I hate war , having actually lived through one in Lebanon , and I hate the idea of people being killed . My critics who imagined me thrilling at NATO bombing raids were just being cruel . But here I agree with President Obama and his citation of Reinhold Niebuhr . You can t protect all victims of mass murder everywhere all the time . But where you can do some good , you should do it , even if you can not do all good . I mourn the deaths of all the people who died in this revolution , especially since many of the Qaddafi brigades were clearly coerced -LRB- they deserted in large numbers as soon as they felt it safe -RRB- . But it was clear to me that Qaddafi was not a man to compromise , and that his military machine would mow down the revolutionaries if it were allowed to . Moreover , those who question whether there were US interests in Libya seem to me a little blind . The US has an interest in there not being massacres of people for merely exercising their right to free assembly . The US has an interest in a lawful world order , and therefore in the United Nations Security Council resolution demanding that Libyans be protected from their murderous government . The US has an interest in its NATO alliance , and NATO allies France and Britain felt strongly about this intervention . The US has a deep interest in the fate of Egypt , and what happened in Libya would have affected Egypt -LRB- Qaddafi allegedly had high Egyptian officials on his payroll -RRB- . Given the controversies about the revolution , it is worthwhile reviewing the myths about the Libyan Revolution that led so many observers to make so many fantastic or just mistaken assertions about it . Qaddafi was a progressive in his domestic policies . While back in the 1970s , Qaddafi was probably more generous in sharing around the oil wealth with the population , buying tractors for farmers , etc. , in the past couple of decades that policy changed . He became vindictive against tribes in the east and in the southwest that had crossed him politically , depriving them of their fair share in the country s resources . And in the past decade and a half , extreme corruption and the rise of post-Soviet-style oligarchs , including Qaddafi and his sons , have discouraged investment and blighted the economy . Workers were strictly controlled and unable to collectively bargain for improvements in their conditions . There was much more poverty and poor infrastructure in Libya than there should have been in an oil state . Qaddafi was a progressive in his foreign policy . Again , he traded for decades on positions , or postures , he took in the 1970s . In contrast , in recent years he played a sinister role in Africa , bankrolling brutal dictators and helping foment ruinous wars . In 1996 the supposed champion of the Palestinian cause expelled 30,000 stateless Palestinians from the country . After he came in from the cold , ending European and US sanctions , he began buddying around with George W. Bush , Silvio Berlusconi and other right wing figures . Berlusconi has even said that he considered resigning as Italian prime minister once NATO began its intervention , given his close personal relationship to Qaddafi . It was only natural that Qaddafi sent his military against the protesters and revolutionaries ; any country would have done the same . No , it wouldn t , and this is the argument of a moral cretin . In fact , the Tunisian officer corps refused to fire on Tunisian crowds for dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and the Egyptian officer corps refused to fire on Egyptian crowds for Hosni Mubarak . The willingness of the Libyan officer corps to visit macabre violence on protesting crowds derived from the centrality of the Qaddafi sons and cronies at the top of the military hierarchy and from the lack of connection between the people and the professional soldiers and mercenaries . Deploying the military against non-combatants was a war crime , and doing so in a widespread and systematic way was a crime against humanity . Qaddafi and his sons will be tried for this crime , which is not perfectly natural . There was a long stalemate in the fighting between the revolutionaries and the Qaddafi military . This idea was fostered by the vantage point of many Western observers , in Benghazi . It is true that there was a long stalemate at Brega , which ended yesterday when the pro-Qaddafi troops there surrendered . But the two most active fronts in the war were Misrata and its environs , and the Western Mountain region . Misrata fought an epic , Stalingrad-style , struggle of self-defense against attacking Qaddafi armor and troops , finally proving victorious with NATO help , and then they gradually fought to the west toward Tripoli . The most dramatic battles and advances were in the largely Berber Western Mountain region , where , again , Qaddafi armored units relentlessly shelled small towns and villages but were fought off -LRB- with less help from NATO initially , which I think did not recognize the importance of this theater -RRB- . It was the revolutionary volunteers from this region who eventually took Zawiya , with the help of the people of Zawiya , last Friday and who thereby cut Tripoli off from fuel and ammunition coming from Tunisia and made the fall of the capital possible . Any close observer of the war since April has seen constant movement , first at Misrata and then in the Western Mountains , and there was never an over-all stalemate . The Libyan Revolution was a civil war . It was not , if by that is meant a fight between two big groups within the body politic . There was nothing like the vicious sectarian civilian-on-civilian fighting in Baghdad in 2006 . The revolution began as peaceful public protests , and only when the urban crowds were subjected to artillery , tank , mortar and cluster bomb barrages did the revolutionaries begin arming themselves . When fighting began , it was volunteer combatants representing their city quarters taking on trained regular army troops and mercenaries . That is a revolution , not a civil war . Only in a few small pockets of territory , such as Sirte and its environs , did pro-Qaddafi civilians oppose the revolutionaries , but it would be wrong to magnify a handful of skirmishes of that sort into a civil war . Qaddafi s support was too limited , too thin , and too centered in the professional military , to allow us to speak of a civil war . Libya is not a real country and could have been partitioned between east and west . It requites no great prescience to see that this will all end up badly . Qaddafi s failure to collapse on schedule is prompting increasing pressure to start a ground war , since the NATO operation is , in terms of prestige , like the banks Obama has bailed out , Too Big to Fail . Libya will probably be balkanized . I don t understand the propensity of Western analysts to keep pronouncing nations in the global south artificial and on the verge of splitting up . It is a kind of Orientalism . All nations are artificial . Benedict Anderson dates the nation-state to the late 1700s , and even if it were a bit earlier , it is a new thing in history . Moreover , most nation-states are multi-ethnic , and many long-established ones have sub-nationalisms that threaten their unity . Thus , the Catalans and Basque are uneasy inside Spain , the Scottish may bolt Britain any moment , etc. , etc. . In contrast , Libya does not have any well-organized , popular separatist movements . It does have tribal divisions , but these are not the basis for nationalist separatism , and tribal alliances and fissures are more fluid than ethnicity -LRB- which is itself less fixed than people assume -RRB- . Everyone speaks Arabic , though for Berbers it is the public language ; Berbers were among the central Libyan heroes of the revolution , and will be rewarded with a more pluralist Libya . This generation of young Libyans , who waged the revolution , have mostly been through state schools and have a strong allegiance to the idea of Libya . Throughout the revolution , the people of Benghazi insisted that Tripoli was and would remain the capital . Westerners looking for break-ups after dictatorships are fixated on the Balkan events after 1989 , but there most often isn t an exact analog to those in the contemporary Arab world . There had to be NATO infantry brigades on the ground for the revolution to succeed . Everyone from Cockburn to Max Boot -LRB- scary when those two agree -RRB- put forward this idea . But there are not any foreign infantry brigades in Libya , and there are unlikely to be any . Libyans are very nationalistic and they made this clear from the beginning . Likewise the Arab League . NATO had some intelligence assets on the ground , but they were small in number , were requested behind the scenes for liaison and spotting by the revolutionaries , and did not amount to an invasion force . The Libyan people never needed foreign ground brigades to succeed in their revolution . The United States led the charge to war . There is no evidence for this allegation whatsoever . When I asked Glenn Greenwald whether a US refusal to join France and Britain in a NATO united front might not have destroyed NATO , he replied that NATO would never have gone forward unless the US had plumped for the intervention in the first place . I fear that answer was less fact-based and more doctrinaire than we are accustomed to hearing from Mr. Greenwald , whose research and analysis on domestic issues is generally first-rate . As someone not a stranger to diplomatic history , and who has actually heard briefings in Europe from foreign ministries and officers of NATO members , I m offended at the glibness of an answer given with no more substantiation than an idee fixe . The excellent McClatchy wire service reported on the reasons for which then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , the Pentagon , and Obama himself were extremely reluctant to become involved in yet another war in the Muslim world . It is obvious that the French and the British led the charge on this intervention , likely because they believed that a protracted struggle over years between the opposition and Qaddafi in Libya would radicalize it and give an opening to al-Qaeda and so pose various threats to Europe . French President Nicolas Sarkozy had been politically mauled , as well , by the offer of his defense minister , Mich le Alliot-Marie , to send French troops to assist Ben Ali in Tunisia -LRB- Alliot-Marie had been Ben Ali s guest on fancy vacations -RRB- , and may have wanted to restore traditional French cachet in the Arab world as well as to look decisive to his electorate . Whatever Western Europe s motivations , they were the decisive ones , and the Obama administration clearly came along as a junior partner -LRB- something Sen. John McCain is complaining bitterly about -RRB- . Qaddafi would not have killed or imprisoned large numbers of dissidents in Benghazi , Derna , al-Bayda and Tobruk if he had been allowed to pursue his March Blitzkrieg toward the eastern cities that had defied him . But we have real-world examples of how he would have behaved , in Zawiya , Tawargha , Misrata and elsewhere . His indiscriminate shelling of Misrata had already killed between 1000 and 2000 by last April , , and it continued all summer . At least one Qaddafi mass grave with 150 bodies in it has been discovered . And the full story of the horrors in Zawiya and elsewhere in the west has yet to emerge , but it will not be pretty . The opposition claims Qaddafi s forces killed tens of thousands . Public health studies may eventually settle this issue , but we know definitively what Qaddafi was capable of . This was a war for Libya s oil . Libya was already integrated into the international oil markets , and had done billions of deals with BP , ENI , etc. , etc. . None of those companies would have wanted to endanger their contracts by getting rid of the ruler who had signed them . They had often already had the trauma of having to compete for post-war Iraqi contracts , a process in which many did less well than they would have liked . ENI s profits were hurt by the Libyan revolution , as were those of Total SA . Moreover , taking Libyan oil off the market through a NATO military intervention could have been foreseen to put up oil prices , which no Western elected leader would have wanted to see , especially Barack Obama , with the danger that a spike in energy prices could prolong the economic doldrums . An economic argument for imperialism is fine if it makes sense , but this one does not , and there is no good evidence for it -LRB- that Qaddafi was erratic is not enough -RRB- , and is therefore just a conspiracy theory . This piece originally appeared on Professor Cole 's blog , Informed Comment . Mr Cole , Who do you get paid by to write up stories like that ? Why on Earth would the already bankrupt Western Governments throw a trillion dollars at this war ? For the love of the Libyan people ? You forgot to mention some key issues like the creation of the African Central Bank , the gold dinars , the African union by Ghaddafi , which effectively would have put the IMF out of business in Africa . In 2006 Tony Blair was buddy buddy with Ghaddafi and Ghaddafi 's sins were absolved . Why after such short time is he suddenly the evil tyrant again ? Protecting civilians by bombarding a country is an insult to intelligence . What are NATO 's real reasons to fork our a trillion dollars for this project ? At the end of the day there is not any country on earth where disgruntled citizens would not rise up to topple the government -- a little outside influence can whip up some support to mobilize these entities .

There are hundreds of examples of this . 834.5 m worth of arms to Lybia over a five year period . UK , France and Italy being the main exporters profiting from these lucrative deals with Ghaddafi . Needless to say that Ghaddafi needed to give some concessions for these extravagant arm deals , like letting foreign oil companies to participate in exploration , give a piece of the banking system to the IMF etc. . But after 2009 he wisened up and would not budge . You are quoting Reinhold Niehbuhr and Obama , surely the best way to protect civilians is to sell their dictator arms , is n't it ? It is very sensible option , to provide a military dictator of 41 years , top notch weapons , especially to Ghadafi , who allegedly blew up the Pan Am flight , and provided breeding ground for terrorist - the largest number of suicide bombers for Iraq . Please explain how you get at the trillion dollar figure for this conflict ? Every source I check has it in 10 ? s of billions tops , that is 2 orders of magnitude difference . I agree why did Mr Cole not mention some other key issues like , the creation of the African Central Bank , the gold dinars , the African union . . And the IMF invovment ... Why leave out these key issues Mr Cole , you are better then that ... So this is an opinion piece , right ? How come is it that mass media outlets never have an opposing opinion piece questioning the legitimacy of the rebels , or the real agenda behind NATO involvement ? It 's all about falling in line and propagating the same bulls \\* it that few informed people are actually buying . For someone who 's lived in `` various parts of the Muslim world for nearly 10 years '' , Juan Cole 's piece reads like a high-schoolers essay with poorly researched arguments and `` the opposition claims '' facts . It 's very discouraging at how disconnected media is from reality and how eager it is to fall in line with NATO foreign policy . Excellent article , I am sick and tired of people propagating these myths . Also I highly doubt any sane person is pro-gaddafi , only anti-NATO . This article is ridiculous . Please I ask you all to do your own research ... . `` Believe Nothing , No Matter Where You Read It , or Who Said It , No Matter If I Have Said It , Unless It Agrees with Your Own Reason and Your Own Common Sense .

U.S. stocks struggled to end barely higher , while gold , a traditional safe haven , hit a third consecutive all-time high near $ 1,900 after staging its biggest weekly gain in 2-1\\/2 years last week . Sharp volatility in stocks , which has marked trading in recent weeks , underscored investor nervousness . The turmoil largely reflects persistent worries that the United States may fall back into recession , as well as the threat that sovereign debt problems in euro zone peripheral countries could spread to the larger economies . The cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one another rose again , heading back toward their highest levels since late 2008 as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to European counterparts in the face of the intractable debt crisis . `` The ground zero of all worries is financials , '' said Charlie Smith , chief investment officer at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group .

Bernanke , however , is most likely to outline gradualist measures , which would disappoint those looking for a big-bang approach such as a fresh round of bond buying , known as QE3 .

These could be implemented in September and October at coming Fed meetings . `` The Fed is definitely on people 's minds , and you could argue that some of the bounce seen in high-yield commodity currencies is at least in part related to hopes for more policy measures , '' said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov in New York .

If peace takes hold in Africa 's largest oil producer after a six-month civil war , the long-dormant economy could rapidly flourish provided there has been no substantial damage to the oil and gas infrastructure underpinning its national wealth . Much remains undecided as anti-government forces gain control of Tripoli in their final push to end the four-decade rule of Muammar Gaddafi but a new Libyan government could herald a bonanza for Western companies and investors . `` Libya is a fantastically wealthy country that does n't need foreign money but foreign expertise . This could be the start of an experiment in hydrocarbon-fueled capitalism with a lot of money up for grabs , '' said Emad Mostaque , Chief Middle East and North Africa strategist at Religare Capital Markets . Though less advanced than the rest of North Africa even prior to the civil war , the Libyan economy has ample resources it could marshal for national reconstruction . An estimated $ 150 billion in sovereign assets once controlled by Gaddafi and his inner circle has been frozen abroad by foreign governments and 144 tonnes of gold is held by the Libyan central bank . Combine that with a modest population of 6.4 million and standards of education on a par with established emerging economies such as Malaysia and Mexico , and Libya looks well placed for recovery , said Sven Richter , head of frontier markets at Renaissance Asset Managers . `` From that point of view , they are in a quite enviable position , '' he said . A sovereign wealth fund set up in 2006 to manage Libya 's oil revenues could also prove pivotal if the new government does not purge all personnel associated with Gaddafi . Though somewhat depleted , the Libyan Investment Authority still holds billions of dollars in cash and a number of lucrative equity stakes in Western blue-chip companies such as Pearson -LRB- PSON . L -RRB- and UniCredit -LRB- CRDI . It could spearhead infrastructure development and make up for some of this year 's slump in foreign direct investments , which according to United Nations data swelled Libya 's coffers by $ 3.8 billion last year . Investment from the fund could also help broaden the Libyan economy away from oil and help attract other sovereign wealth funds and longer term foreign investors . `` In the last couple of weeks , there have been increasing questions about the unity of the rebels , especially after the killing of General Abdel Fattah Younes just 12 days ago , '' said Raza Agha , MENA economist at RBS . The death of the rebel military commander after he was taken into custody by his own side for questioning remains unexplained , underscoring the disparate nature of the rebel National Transitional Council as a mix of Gaddafi opponents . `` Beyond Gaddafi , there is a lack of any unifying institution or individual . In Egypt and Tunisia , for example , the military was held in high esteem by the population , '' said Agha . If it can hold together , the new government is likely to be friendly toward the West , having come into power supported by NATO air strikes . An official at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO has already said the company may have difficulties working with China , Russia and Brazil which opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi . So Western companies look well positioned as billions of dollars in oil exploration and construction contracts come up for grabs as part of the reconstruction effort . Religare 's Mostaque also expects Qatari banks and firms to benefit when Libya reopens its doors to investment . Qatar was quick to establish links with Libyan rebels and was the first Arab country to contribute planes to police United Nations-backed no-fly zones over the country . Until fighting broke out in February , Libya was the world 's 12th largest oil exporter though its output was modest , coming in at about 1.6 million barrels a day or 2 percent of global oil output . The disruption of Libyan supply was thus easily compensated by increased Saudi production . The incoming government will likely focus on raising the country 's production capacity with a view to capitalizing on its oil reserves , the ninth largest in the world . Investors also see potential in Libya 's banking and insurance sector , which briefly enjoyed foreign investor interest when decades of Western sanctions were lifted in 2004 . France 's BNP Paribas -LRB- BNPP . PA -RRB- took a minority stake in a local bank when banking rules were eased and Renaissance 's Richter expects foreign interest to revive when stability returns . `` Financial services demand will be driven by the oil industry , '' he said .

Brent pared losses , bouncing with rallying U.S. crude on the day the September contract expired as rising Wall Street equities provided a boost . Brent crude 's forward curve flattened in the months through early next year and its premium to U.S. crude fell on hopes that a swift end to Libya 's civil war would bring the country 's oil exports back to the market . Some output will be able to restart in a few months , but it will take as long as 18 months to reach prewar levels , Libya 's former top oil official Shokri Ghanem said . Muammar Gaddafi was a hunted man as remnants of his forces made a last-ditch stand in Libya 's capital . `` While the Libyan leadership could be in the state of flux for several more days or even a few weeks , developments thus far strongly suggest a return of Libyan exports to the global market place , '' Jim Ritterbusch , president at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena , Illinois , said in a note . U.S. crude prices had an early boost from dollar weakness before the U.S. currency recovered as the euro fell back . The dollar had been pressured on speculation that the Federal Reserve this week might indicate a need to take additional measures to support an ailing economy . U.S. equities also seesawed , slipping early , bouncing and pushing higher , then ending little changed as investors remained cautious after recent sharp declines . Brent October crude fell 26 cents to settle at $ 108.36 a barrel , having bounced off a $ 105.15 low . Brent also had technical support from its intraday recovery back above its 200-day moving average of $ 107.91 .

Brent 's premium to U.S. crude narrowed to below $ 24 a barrel , after reaching a record $ 26.69 on Friday . U.S. crude trading volumes slightly outpaced Brent . Both topped 500,000 lots traded and Brent surpassed its 30-day average . Part of U.S. crude divergence from Brent is because traders are starting to bail out of their Brent\\/U . S. spread positions , said Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute . Brent 's premium to U.S. crude , partially blamed on the glut of crude at the Cushing , Oklahoma , hub , may linger as the effort to build a pipeline to move crude to the refinery-rich Houston area stalls . Enterprise Products Partners ' cancellation last week of a joint venture pipeline with Energy Transfer Partners due to lack of shipper commitment was the first casualty in the race to build a pipeline . Before the war cut Libya 's output , the country pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day . Most of Libya 's high-quality crude went to European refiners . After Libyan exports ceased , tighter supply sent Brent to a two-year high of $ 127.02 in April . `` The limited resistance to rebel forces entering Tripoli may herald a swift resolution to the civil war , opening the potential for the resumption of Libyan oil exports by the end of 2011 , '' JPMorgan said in a note to clients .

In interviews with some of the biggest oil services players in pre-civil war Libya , most echoed the view that major oil fields had largely avoided serious damage during the six months of fighting , though some voiced concerns about damage to export terminals and pipelines . OPS International Chairman Gavin De Salis told Reuters Insider television that Libyan crude oil , prized for its high yield of valuable light products such as gasoline and for its low sulfur content , was quite waxy , which could clog up pipelines if they had been left unused for some time . `` There might be a little bit of effort unplugging pipelines , which is two to three months ' worth of effort before they can resume full production , '' De Salis said . `` But that will not affect all of the pipelines or all of the fields , so they can certainly start limited production quite quickly . '' Nilsson said contacts at Libya 's rebel oil firm Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- informed him there had been little damage to the oilfields in the east of the country during the six-month power struggle . `` We have n't been able to work at the oilfields during the civil war as it has not been safe , but I think within a couple of weeks we could be back to almost normal , '' Nilsson said by telephone from his office in Stockholm . `` The oil income is essential to Libya and the new government so they will want to bring it back online as soon as possible . '' Nilsson said they had several Swedish , Indian and Sudanese employees who had stayed in the country during the civil war , but total staff numbers in the country were down from around 250-300 . He said he expected international employees to start returning to Libya in about a month 's time . DAMAGE Oil firm 's who supported the rebel government during the civil war are expected to win the lion 's share of contracts to help relaunch the Libyan oil industry , which before the war produced some 1.6 million barrels per day of crude . Those based in countries that were quick to back military action by NATO , including France , Britain and the United States , are thought to be particularly well positioned . PA -RRB- , the Paris-based oil services and engineering firm , said it did n't have any employees in Libya at the present time , but it expected to play a role in helping oil and gas companies quickly resume production . Oil major 's like Italy 's ENI -LRB- ENI . MI -RRB- , the largest producer in Libya before the outbreak of fighting , is positioning for an early return to Libya . Analysts said getting production back up to speed quickly could help its `` good will '' with any new government , after it was seen as slow to distance itself from Muammar Gaddafi at the start of the conflict . Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy said oil fields in the south west of the country had largely escaped the fighting , and said production throughout Libya could rise to 250,000-350 ,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- within three months . `` Planning for the post-war recovery seems to be in full swing with both international oil companies -LRB- IOCs -RRB- , as well as oil service companies , starting to prepare for swift deployment of key personnel to assist with production start-ups and repairs , '' Ciszuk said . `` In the south-west , where no fighting occurred and where the effects of looting and vandalism are thought to be low , production ... could start rising towards the pre-war 200,000 bpd level perhaps as soon as the pipeline to the coast is repaired and cleaned of potential residues . '' The oil port of Ras Lanuf saw some of the heaviest fighting in the war , but a rebel spokesman said there was no apparent damage to facilities after pro-Gaddafi forces retreated from the area on Tuesday . -LRB- ID : nLDE77M0VJ -RRB- NEW OPPORTUNITIES Oil services group Petrofac -LRB- PFC.

The question is how long and difficult the transition will be , '' But some experienced players in Libya injected a note of caution as to how long it would be before there was enough stability in the country to resume work there , both in terms of violence and the resolution of existing contracts . `` I am sure that whatever government emerges will put a real priority on getting the oil industry into good shape but historically things have taken a long time in Libya , '' Allister Langlands , chief executive of oil services firm Wood Group said on Tuesday . `` It 's too early to say more than that .

The rebels , who are close to winning a six-month war against Muammar Gaddafi , have already said firms from Russia and China could fall out of favor for the lack of support for the uprising , thus opening the doors to companies from Britain , France and the United States to gain more assets . `` In the short-to-mid term I see no risk for Eni . Any new government will need cash and that means getting production onstream fast . To do that they 'll need Eni , '' said Stefano Casertano , senior fellow at German think-tank BIGS-Potsdam . `` We 'll see further on if there 's a diplomatic-type attack for access to what Eni controls , '' he added . While Italy hesitated , Britain , France and the U.S. led the early drive for intervention in Libya to protect the rebels . Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi , long Gaddafi 's closest European ally , was silent in the initial days of the uprising in February , and his government 's calls for Gaddafi to step down were much more subdued than those of European peers . Berlusconi has also said he was against NATO intervention in Libya but was forced to go along with it . His main coalition partner , the Northern League , has long opposed intervention . In March , Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni called on Europe to abandon sanctions against Libya in an attempt to rebuild bridges when Gaddafi had seemed to be regaining control of the country . A diplomatic source in Rome told Reuters last month Italy 's initially subdued condemnation of Gaddafi followed by an abrupt switch in April to fully back the rebels had damaged its credibility and could prove costly in the long run . Italy has recently moved fast to seize back the initiative . Berlusconi said he will meet Libyan rebel leader Mahmoud Jibril , and Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Eni staff were in Libya to try to restart oil facilities , adding , `` It is clear Eni will play a No. 1 role in the future . '' France 's Total is an active player in Libya . Britain 's BP has assets there but no production , as does Royal Dutch Shell . U.S. groups Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips are also active . Gaddafi 's fall could give new players such as Qatar 's national oil company and trading house Vitol opportunities . Qatar was quick to establish links with Libyan rebels and was the first Arab country to give planes to police no-fly zones . `` There is obviously some benefit to the countries that helped the Libyans in the crisis , but that advantage can go quite quickly . So British companies and French companies would want to get there as quickly as possible , '' Gavin De Salis , chairman of oil services firm OPS International , told Reuters Insider . Eni , in Libya since the 1950s , produced about 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010 . Its oil production contracts are in force to 2042 and gas contracts to 2047 . `` Eni getting production restarted fast would win it good will with any new government in Libya , '' said Justin Jacobs , oil and gas analyst at Business Monitor International . Eni has said that if stability returns , it would take one year to restart oil production and two to three months for gas . On Tuesday the Libyan rebel envoy to Italy said he expected Italian contracts to be respected in a post-Gaddafi era . Russia and China opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi , and some say energy companies there could feel a backlash . `` We do n't have a problem with Western countries like Italians , French and UK companies . But we may have some political issues with Russia , China and Brazil , '' said Abdeljalil Mayouf , information head at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO . Russian companies , including oil firms Gazprom Neft and Tatneft , had projects worth billions of dollars in Libya before the conflict started . China , which took 3 percent of its imported crude from Libya last year , had about 75 companies operating there . `` The Chinese and Russians were reticent to step in and play an active pro-rebel role . Certainly European and U.S. companies stand to benefit from that , '' said Jacobs . Before the war , Gazprom Neft agreed to buy a stake from Eni in Libya 's Elephant field , but that has been put on hold . Eni is a strategic partner of Gazprom . Going forward , much will depend on what a future rebel government will look like and where its sympathies lie . `` The big question is who the rebels are . I do n't think we 've seen the real leadership yet , which will probably be made up of new figures , '' said Karim Mezran , professor for Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Bologna . `` And another big issue is unfreezing Libyan assets . How the European countries handle that one could give them leverage for their own oil companies .

Calling the situation fluid , Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said that Gaddafi 's forces remained dangerous even though their command capabilities had been diminished by major rebel advances into the heart of the capital and NATO air strikes . The United States , which is providing Predator drones and other air capabilities to the NATO mission , sharply stepped up the tempo of its air strikes on Libya over the past week and a half , according to Pentagon data . `` It 's still very fluid , there 's still fighting going on , '' Lapan said . `` While we believe that opposition forces control a large part of the country , Libya and Tripoli in particular are still very dangerous places . '' Asked specifically about Tripoli , Lapan said the situation was too fluid to put a precise percentage on how much of the city was under rebel control . Rebel leaders say 80 percent of the Libyan capital is now controlled by forces opposed to Gaddafi . `` Majority -LRB- control of Tripoli -RRB- is safe but I would n't get beyond that , '' he said . The United States was monitoring Libya 's chemical weapons sites , Lapan said , amid concern in Congress that those and other Libyan weapons could fall into the wrong hands . Lapan said he was aware of a total of two Scud missile launches by Gaddafi forces . A U.S. official told Reuters that neither caused any injuries or deaths . `` Regime forces are going to use whatever means they have to continue to inflict damage on their opponents and on the civilian population , '' he said . The Pentagon said on Monday that it believed Gaddafi had not left the country , a position Lapan reaffirmed on Tuesday , saying : `` Nothing 's changed . '' Still , he did not offer any more precise assessment about Gaddafi 's potential whereabouts . Gaddafi 's son and presumed heir Saif al-Islam told a crowd that his father was well and still in Tripoli , confounding reports of his capture . Asked whether the Pentagon was surprised by the emergence of Gaddafi 's son , whom the rebels had initially said was in their hands , Lapan said : `` We 've seen conflicting reports .

In interviews with some of the biggest oil services players in pre-civil war Libya , most echoed the view that major oil fields had largely avoided serious damage during the six months of fighting , though some voiced concerns about damage to export terminals and pipelines . OPS International Chairman Gavin De Salis told Reuters Insider television that Libyan crude oil , prized for its high yield of valuable light products such as gasoline and for its low sulfur content , was quite waxy , which could clog up pipelines if they had been left unused for some time . `` There might be a little bit of effort unplugging pipelines , which is two to three months ' worth of effort before they can resume full production , '' De Salis said . `` But that will not affect all of the pipelines or all of the fields , so they can certainly start limited production quite quickly . '' Nilsson said contacts at Libya 's rebel oil firm Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- informed him there had been little damage to the oilfields in the east of the country during the six-month power struggle . `` We have n't been able to work at the oilfields during the civil war as it has not been safe , but I think within a couple of weeks we could be back to almost normal , '' Nilsson said by telephone from his office in Stockholm . `` The oil income is essential to Libya and the new government so they will want to bring it back online as soon as possible . '' Nilsson said they had several Swedish , Indian and Sudanese employees who had stayed in the country during the civil war , but total staff numbers in the country were down from around 250-300 . He said he expected international employees to start returning to Libya in about a month 's time . Oil firm 's who supported the rebel government during the civil war are expected to win the lion 's share of contracts to help relaunch the Libyan oil industry , which before the war produced some 1.6 million barrels per day of crude . Those based in countries that were quick to back military action by NATO , including France , Britain and the United States , are thought to be particularly well positioned . PA -RRB- , the Paris-based oil services and engineering firm , said it did n't have any employees in Libya at the present time , but it expected to play a role in helping oil and gas companies quickly resume production . Oil major 's like Italy 's ENI -LRB- ENI . MI -RRB- , the largest producer in Libya before the outbreak of fighting , is positioning for an early return to Libya . Analysts said getting production back up to speed quickly could help its `` good will '' with any new government , after it was seen as slow to distance itself from Muammar Gaddafi at the start of the conflict . Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy said oil fields in the south west of the country had largely escaped the fighting , and said production throughout Libya could rise to 250,000-350 ,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- within three months . `` Planning for the post-war recovery seems to be in full swing with both international oil companies -LRB- IOCs -RRB- , as well as oil service companies , starting to prepare for swift deployment of key personnel to assist with production start-ups and repairs , '' Ciszuk said . `` In the south-west , where no fighting occurred and where the effects of looting and vandalism are thought to be low , production ... could start rising towards the pre-war 200,000 bpd level perhaps as soon as the pipeline to the coast is repaired and cleaned of potential residues . '' The oil port of Ras Lanuf saw some of the heaviest fighting in the war , but a rebel spokesman said there was no apparent damage to facilities after pro-Gaddafi forces retreated from the area on Tuesday . -LRB- ID : nLDE77M0VJ -RRB- Oil services group Petrofac -LRB- PFC. L -RRB- , that was n't active in pre-civil war Libya , said it now saw more opportunities in the country . `` Whilst short term developments are difficult to predict , Libya has substantial oil and gas reserves and restoring production will be key to getting the Libyan economy going again , '' Petrofac 's chief financial officer Keith Roberts said . `` Over the medium to long term there are considerable opportunities in the country , and therefore we see the prospects for the services industry as very positive . The question is how long and difficult the transition will be , '' But some experienced players in Libya injected a note of caution as to how long it would be before there was enough stability in the country to resume work there , both in terms of violence and the resolution of existing contracts . `` I am sure that whatever government emerges will put a real priority on getting the oil industry into good shape but historically things have taken a long time in Libya , '' Allister Langlands , chief executive of oil services firm Wood Group said on Tuesday . `` It 's too early to say more than that .

Thomas Jefferson once said rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God . The Arab Spring is reminding the world that struggles for dignity , freedom , justice and human rights spring from our deepest aspirations as human beings . At the same time the dictatorial violence in Syria and Libya remind us of the evil that springs from the insatiable will to absolute power . The repression in Syria has claimed more than 2,200 lives according to the United Nations . Thankfully , the bloodshed is coming to an end in Libya , but it must be remembered that in Libya , unlike Tunisia and Egypt , it took a bloody civil war and NATO intervention to destroy the decades-long tyranny of Muammar Gaddafi . Events in Libya compel us to reflect on fundamental moral questions that are larger than geopolitics and the price of petroleum . But it is impossible to reflect on those moral questions without scrutinizing the compromising attitudes that stem from our acute concerns about national security and access to cheap oil . In September 2004 the United States lifted economic sanctions leveled against the Gaddafi regime in response to its most egregious act of terror -- the destruction of Pan 103 in December 1988 . The Bush administration restored full diplomatic relations two years later . It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . Pan Am 103 was not Gaddafi s only act of terror : his intelligence service was behind the destruction of a TWA flight in 1974 and sponsored the Abu Nidal organizations acts of terrorism well into the 1980s -- acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . President Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . The Bush administration cited Gaddafi s shrewd decision to dismantle a crude nuclear weapons program and its payment of reparations to the families of the victims of Pan Am 103 to justify the opening of an American embassy in Tripoli . Neither of these empty gestures translated into a fundamental change in the nature of the Gaddafi tyranny . Gaddafi cunningly suspended the foreign terror operations but continued to terrorize the Libyan people with the confidence of a tyrant with a new lease on life . President Bush never openly condemned the repression in Libya , despite his lofty rhetoric about America 's commitment to democracy in the Middle East at the onset of the war in Iraq . The appeasement with Libya was always about petroleum , never about principle . September 11 deepened the Bush administration s disturbing relationship with Gaddafi . The administration secretly reached out to Libyan intelligence to cooperate in the global war on terrorism . In their memoirs , former CIA officials describe surreal meetings with Libyan intelligence chieftains whom they suspected of involvement in the destruction of Pan Am 103 . Libyan officials were only too pleased to identify , detain and torture Libyans who gravitated to Al Qaeda at the behest of the CIA . Perhaps the collaboration with Libyan intelligence seemed like a morally acceptable compromise after the slaughter of Americans on 9\\/11 , but the secret partnership with Gaddafi served emboldened him in his secret campaign to ratchet up the repression in Libya . If rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God , then surely compromise with tyrants smacks of a pact with the devil . The challenge of reconciling U.S. economic and security interests with American values has always vexed Americans in high office . But Libya under Gaddafi was a simple case of moral and political discernment . The United States failed that test badly . America gained nothing of lasting value from its relationship with Gaddafi . It only bought a tyrant more time , and cost more Libyan lives .

REUTERS\\/Bob Strong `` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' The U.S. has supported many brutal tyrants : Saddam Hussein , Augusto Pinochet , Hosni Mubarak , Doc Chevalier , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos , Suharto , and Somoza just to name a few . Supporting Gaddafi falls into the category of normal U.S. geopolitics . Americans having been willing , decade after decade , to vote for leaders who have supported brutal dictators around the world . Where then is the conflict with American values ? American values seem to include supporting dictators around the world whenever various geopolitical goals are at stake . `` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' Bush brought Gaddafi back into the international fold because Gaddafi renounced nuclear weapons . You think that 's insignificant ? NATO is a big reason for the bloodshed in Libya today . Talk to the current president if you have a problem with that . And by the way , Gaddafi only dreamed of and talked about perpetrating the kind of violence against demonstrators that Syria 's Assad is actually doing . I do n't see America doing much about that , other than finger wagging . Although Republicans in the US often pain themselves as foreign policy experts , their actions and policies are often bizzare . In the late 90 ? The Bush administration officially praised the Taliban for helping to eradicate Afghanistan 's poppy crop about 6 months before the Sept 11 attacks . The whole Iraq war\\/weapons of mass destruction thing speaks for itself . For the Bush administration , driven by a family so steeped in big oil , their crazy decisions all seemed to revolve around gaining access to oil fields , either through force or diplomacy . I believe McCain even cast doubt on Pakistan 's previously democratically elected leaders and praised the military dictator running Pakistan at that time . And with all of the military escapades of the Bush administration , when Obama announced limited US engagement in Lybia , the Republicans cried foul . George Bush Sr. ran a smooth and reasonable campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait in the early 90 ? s.

The Bush Administration was an institution without morals . Still , its legacy is vested in the Tea Party revolutionary movement of today . I presume the London School of Economics is mourning Gadaffi 's fall from power . If ever there was an fine example of lefties consorting with dictators -LRB- as the right correctly argues -RRB- LSE 's ` friendship ' with Gaddafi must be it . So much for standing up for the people . The left is all about grabbing power in any shape or form . Nothing for nothing , but I think you need to go back to your research and check on something ... `` acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . President Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . While I think this is a little sensationalist to say that Americans were the primary targets in these attacks , these were attacks specifically against Israel and Israelis targeting El Al airlines ticket counters in Italy and Austria by Abu Nadil as retaliation against Israel for Operation Wooden Leg , where Israel bombed the PLO headquarters in Tunis -LRB- 10\\/85 -RRB- . This had nothing to do with an attack on American children at all . I would suffice to say that if Americans were killed as additional damage , that Abu Nadil would n't have minded , however , that was not their main goal . All too reminiscent of our early ties with Saddam Hussein . We armed him to the teeth to be a counterweight to Iran and to guarantee the stability of Gulf oil . And then he began to feel invincible . We all know how that ended . Keep an eye an Saudi Arabia . We might see something similar happen there in the years to come . Thanks for explaining so much . Ms. Clinton continued the tradition of Gaddafi-coddling by a stubborn reluctance to support the rebels . Obama was finally shamed into doing some air support for rebels when France and Britain took the leadership . The Nato bombing started much too late . When Nato started air strikes , Gaddafi 's long exposed armored columns were now in the cities terrorizing citizens and the opportunity to wipe them out quickly was gone . Without a doubt Oil is always an issue for the US in the ME . The next issue is the welfare of Israel , still he only country actually eating another territory\\/country alive . But the US has only itself to blame for its dependence on oil -- wherever the source . It had spent the last 50 plus years building urban areas enslaved by the automakers . Most of the oil it uses is for transportation and home heating costs . it also uses more than any other country on a daily for auto use alone . the last note got sent accidentally . The problem is -- there is no fix for suburban sprawl . It 's too diffuse and too expensive to service with adequate alternative transportation and many of the old rail lines are gone and their ROW 's are being eaten by encroachment by abutters or put to alternate uses like bicycle and hiking paths . The sprawl itself usually kills off any local agriculture so the urban areas ca n't feed themselves at all without trucking everything from thousands of miles away . I look at Google earth to view urban areas world wide and very few of them -- even the gigantic areas like Sao Paolo , Or Beijing and even most European Cities look they are still being constructed around rail lines or other public transportation systems . Large areas of Japan have become continuous city . But they have 180 million people I recall . The radiating valleys in the Kyoto area are continuous strips of farmsteads that all front on the common roads . It must be easy to run regular bus lines along any of them to the nearest located rail lines . As the country ages , it will become more difficult for seniors to have to live without public transportation . Nursing home life is a miserable and very expensive way to die . And owning a car is becoming more expensive . This country has made walking for daily errands or taking a bus or train impractical for any but inner city commuters residents . The private automobile is one of the factors behind the trillions spent in foreign wars . The biggest public transportation subsidies are being eaten by the automakers and it is the most inefficient way to move people . And all of the above to be held hostage by the cost of gas . Very stupid and not at all worth it . There 's a mistake in the last paragraph . I meant to write `` that European cities look like they are being constructed around public transportation lines '' In other words : most of the world had more sense . And I want to add , that for decades European countries put a very high tax on gasoline . I do n't know for sure , but I think most countries except the ME , have taxed gasoline heavily . If analysts totaled all the costs of extensive road and highway networks , purchase price and repair bills , gasoline costs , taxes and insurance costs , prison time and lost productivity for DUI and other auto related legal issues , a system that is so ubiquitous it is n't possible in most suburban areas to walk to a convenient store to get a few groceries , and then the costs of fighting in expensive conflicts that masquerade as `` freedom fighting '' to ensure that it can control in same way the costs of oil , the automobile is probably the single biggest waste of money and time ever invented . Paintcan -- took a while -- but -- spot on !! seems our society neve gets to the `` bones '' of a problem . I look up and see the sun -- literally -- burning -- at no cost to anyone -- burning -- day after day , after day , after day ... Guess it is more fun to create sophisticated weapons to drain blood , limb and life from the body of anyone who dares to stand in the path leading to highly polluting , highly profitable , cheap -LRB- ? -RRB- Thanks nyman , Solar energy is n't as practical for the northern hemisphere but geo-thermal potential is far more prevalent . The states west of Kansas from Mexico to Canada are all potential sites . The plants are models of simplicity without carbon emissions or toxic waste . It seems the only difficulty is drilling deep enough with a large enough diameter pipe . But fossil fuels need not be outlawed as fuels . Some places would always need it . Many places and developing countries could and are developing other power sources . You can find maps online charting global geothermal potential . But it 's easy to tell why Qaddafi was a tyrant with off than on again and than off again popularity . Libya had enormous cash reserves and the largest oil deposits in Africa . This country and Europe both need cheap oil and will get it and control it any way they can . The rest is a matter of propagandizing their countries into accepting the new political reality . It will be easy to get consensus . All the powers that be have to do , is raise the price at the pumps and the countries will fall over themselves to get to even more benighted brethren who ` need out help '' . Any country with massive mineral wealth is a potential target for the new global concern . And we will all learn to accept the new morality or else . We just have to rescue the Saudi 's the UAE from their ruling dynasts .

A transitional council of Libyan rebels has already tried to roughly outline rebuilding plans , using a Power Point presentation for stabilizing a country while it is in the final throes of a violent transition . Diplomats who have seen the rough plan say the rebel Transitional National Council knows it must move swiftly to meet expectations of the masses of people who have provided the support and manpower to oust Muammar Gaddafi after 42 years . Among the TNC 's biggest concerns is that the United States and others will be too slow in unfreezing billions of dollars of Gaddafi 's assets , leading to a complete breakdown of basic services , Western and Middle East diplomats told Reuters . One option under consideration was for the transitional council to seek temporary bridge financing from the World Bank and other global institutions until political decisions are made to return all of its assets , the officials said . Even as fierce fighting persists in Tripoli , diplomats and financiers are accelerating plans to help Libyans rebuild once Gaddafi 's regime is ended . The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it was seeking to release between $ 1 billion -LRB- 605.7 million pounds -RRB- and $ 1.5 billion of frozen Libyan government assets to the rebels within days if it can secure the blessing of the United Nations sanctions committee . The money would come from the roughly $ 32 billion in assets that the United States froze earlier this year , only about one-tenth of which , or $ 3 billion , is liquid . Diplomats said until the assets were unfrozen and all of the $ 32 billion is released , Libya would likely be under tight budget constraints , a risk for any new government seeking legitimacy . The TNC has said it will meet officials from the United States , France , Italy , Britain , Turkey and Qatar in Doha on Wednesday to seek international funds to help Libya recover from the war . U.S. APPEARS TO WANT ONLY SUPPORTING ROLE The next phase of planning for post-conflict Libya would occur in Istanbul on Thursday , where senior diplomats from nations of the Libya Contact Group will gather , said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland . It appears the United States wants to play , at best , a supporting role in post-war Libya , working through the United Nations and global financial institutions like the World Bank . Libya 's problems are unique because , after four decades of Gaddafi 's personalized rule , it does not have a regular state structure and therefore it is difficult for institutions like the World bank to know whether or not they are dealing with official representatives of Libya . In addition , because of its oil wealth , Libya is considered a middle-income country and therefore is not eligible for some of the direct aid that poorer nations might qualify for through development institutions . `` It is going to be a challenge , '' said Marwan Muasher , a former foreign minister and deputy prime minister of Jordan , now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington . `` There were no functioning institutions of the state to start with so you 're almost starting from scratch anyway , '' said Muasher , a former World Bank official QUICK COLLAPSE EVOKES IRAQ 'S 2003 DEFEAT The quick collapse of Gaddafi 's authority has inevitably evoked comparisons to the rapid U.S. military victory in Iraq in 2003 , which was followed by looting , chaos and civil war . But a former senior U.S. diplomat with extensive experience in the Middle East said , `` Libya , on the face of it , ought to be a simpler case '' than Iraq . While acknowledging poor management of some state services , the former diplomat said the existence of a senior managerial class made Libya `` much more encouraging in that respect than the Baghdad of 2003 and those people need to feel like they have a stake , immediately , in the revival of their nation . '' More than 30 countries have recognized the rebels ' TNC as the legitimate government of Libya , although it has not officially been acknowledged by international lenders like the International Monetary Fund . A Washington-based diplomat told Reuters that Libya would likely be discussed by the world 's leading economies of the Group of Eight at a September 9-10 meeting in France . It could also be taken up by the Group of 20 leading economies on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings later next month . The country 's assets in foreign currencies have reached about $ 168 billion and oil production could resume within the next 3 to 6 months , according to Libya 's former central bank governor . A sovereign wealth fund set up in 2006 to manage Libya 's oil revenues could also be pivotal for the country 's post-conflict transition , especially to rebuild broken infrastructure . Though somewhat depleted the Libyan Investment Authority still holds billions of dollars in cash and a number of lucrative equity stakes in Western blue-chip companies such as Pearson and Unicredit . There were attempts under Gaddafi to modernize the oil-based economy and government services by passing laws to attract new investment . But much of the effort was wasted and pressure will be on the new transitional council to show Libya can be more than just an oil revenue-dependent country .

Analysts say Gaddafi loyalist fighters confronted with an influx of rebels since the weekend have sought to use his Bab al-Azizyah bastion as a springboard from which to carve out a loyalist zone and chip away at rebel control of adjoining neighborhoods . The encampment is believed to sit atop a network of tunnels and bunkers that lead to adjoining districts , including possibly a subterranean route to the coast . But the tunnel networks are not the loyalist militiamen 's only card : Gaddafi 's fighters have an intimate knowledge of the city and many are believed to have a greater degree of military training than their opposition guerrilla opponents . `` This is Gaddafi 's Pentagon , '' said Noman Benotman , a senior analyst at the British think tank Quilliam and a former Libyan Islamist opposition guerrilla commander . He said tunnels forking out from the complex to nearby districts gave his fighters precious access to supplies . `` Based in Bab al-Azizyah , Gaddafi 's force want to create chaos inside Tripoli and carve it up into rival militia zones , just like Beirut in the Lebanese civil war , '' said Benotman , who is also an associate of former Libyan spy chief Moussa Koussa `` By sending a message that ` there will be no peace without us ' his aim is to force his inclusion in talks on a political negotiation . '' Long the seat of Gaddafi 's power as well as his main Tripoli home , the barracks may well be the final battleground of Libya 's war . Even if Gaddafi is not there , its loss would inflict a potentially crippling symbolic defeat . If Gaddafi is at the six sq-km -LRB- 2.3 sq mi -RRB- base , located south of Tripoli at the northern end of the Airport Highway , there is a fair chance he is in a tunnel under it rather than in a fortified room above ground . The compound has often been targeted by NATO air strikes , but it is still defended by tanks and snipers , a fact that suggests Gaddafi or at least some key aides are nearby . Al Arabiya news channel said rebel forces had attacked the gates of the compound Tuesday as NATO warplanes flew low overhead . Sky Television said smoke could be seen billowing from the compound following a NATO attack . COMPOUND WALLS CAN BE BREACHED `` FROM THE AIR '' The site is normally dotted with tents , residential buildings , security encampments , and the cratered remains of a house bombed by U.S. warplanes in 1986 and kept in ruins as a memorial . A communications center , attacked months ago by NATO , sits on an adjoining plot . Umar al-Hariri , a military official of the rebel Libyan National Transitional Council , told Al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper in June that the barracks were linked to underground tunnels up to 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- long , some of which led to the sea . Hariri said that for rebel fighters attacking the compound it was just as important for NATO to breach the meter-thick , olive-green walls as to access the tunnels underneath . `` I met NATO at one time and told them that the most important thing they should strike are the walls of Bab al-Aziziyah because their thickness is one meter and they can not be penetrated by a tank or gun . There must be a penetration from the air , '' he was quoted as saying . He put the height of the walls at four meters . Built in the era of King Idris , overthrown by Gaddafi in the 1969 putsch that brought him to power , the site was reinforced in the 1980s using an array of foreign contractors . Analysts say Western intelligence services will have long ago sought to question any foreign companies that helped build tunnels under the site , to learn how to attack the compound . From a rebel and Western perspective , that information is growing more valuable by the hour . Jon Marks , chairman of Britain 's Cross Border Information risk consultancy and information service , said he suspected Western governments will have asked foreign companies that helped Gaddafi build his Great Man Made River project for any information about the tunnels under Tripoli , on the assumption some may have helped build them . The Man Made River project sends water from wells in the Sahara desert to coastal communities along a 4,000 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- - long network of pipelines . `` The governments will be asking the companies for a debrief , '' he said , adding the Tripoli tunnels `` may have been done as a side order from the Man Made River work .

Chavez , who has been the most vocal world leader to support Gaddafi , accused Western powers of riding roughshod over international law by backing Libya 's rebels in their revolt . `` This is kicking , spitting ... on the most basic elements of international law , '' he said . `` Where are the international rights ? This is like the caveman era . '' Venezuela 's socialist leader spoke after rebels overran Gaddafi 's compound in Tripoli in what appeared to be the end of his 42-year rule . During six months of civil war more than 30 countries , including the United States and major European Union countries , have moved to recognize the rebel National Transitional Council as the governing authority in Libya . `` Now -LRB- U.S. President Barack -RRB- Obama said he will collaborate economically with the new government , which of course we do not recognize , '' Chavez said . `` We only recognize one government , the one led by Muammar Gaddafi , '' he said to applause as he presided over a cabinet meeting broadcast live on state TV . The 57-year-old former soldier has repeatedly accused Western powers of fuelling the conflict to steal Libya 's oil and on Tuesday said they were waging a `` dogs ' war . '' `` It 's harsh but true ... They arranged this war , '' Chavez said , referring to the United States . `` They provided the arms , the mercenaries . They better not attempt to apply the Libyan formula to Venezuela or we 'll have to show them our power . '' Both Chavez and Gaddafi are military men who cast themselves as anti-imperialist revolutionaries and forged a friendship during half a dozen encounters in the past decade . They have enjoyed a long-standing alliance based on left-wing economic ideas , antagonistic relations with the United States , and their countries ' membership in OPEC . Chavez studied Gaddafi 's `` Green Book '' outlining his political philosophy while in the army , and both men have given each other numerous gifts and awards . Back in March , the Venezuelan leader proposed a vague peace plan for Libya that received little support from either side . Some media reports have suggested Gaddafi , whose whereabouts remain unknown , could seek asylum in Venezuela but Chavez made no reference to that . -LRB- Editing by Daniel Wallis and Bill Trott -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "273", "dct": "2011-08-24", "dates": ["2011-08-24", "2011-08-24", "2011-08-23", "2011-08-24"], "text": "\\* Continued fighting in Tripoli blocks inflow of aid \\* Dire shortages of food , water , blood for medical care \\* Libyan hospital staff overwhelmed GENEVA , Aug 24 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Conditions in Tripoli 's hospitals could become catastrophic without a rapid improvement in security in the Libyan capital , the emergency coordinator of aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- told Reuters on Wednesday . Medical supplies ran low during six months of civil war but have almost completely dried up in the siege and battle of the past week . Fuel supplies have run out and the few remaining medical workers are struggling to get to work . `` The situation is very tough and the movement is very restricted . The situation in medical structures at the moment is not good , it 's almost a catastrophe , '' MSF 's Rosa Crestani said . `` There are clearly shortages of life-saving medication and equipment . There are no antibiotics and instruments for life-saving surgery . '' Crestani , who is based in Brussels but in close contact with MSF staff on the ground in Libya , said the most urgent cases included not just those wounded in the fighting , but also civilians such as women needing caesarian sections . Hospital staff are overwhelmed and exhausted , she said . Muftah Etwilb , a spokesman for the International Federation of the Red Cross in Benghazi , said he had spoken to the director of Tripoli Central Hospital who said he was appealing for his staff to come to work despite the security situation . Restricted movement across the capital has exacerbated supply problems , Etwilb said , with Tripoli Central likely to run out of oxygen stocks within two or three days . A rebel spokesman said all of Tripoli 's health facilities were suffering from shortages and urged doctors to return to work . `` There is a real catastrophe here , '' he said . `` Appeals were made yesterday in the streets and mosques for urgent help . There is also a dangerous shortage of blood at hospitals for the wounded ... and a shortage of foodstuffs . Drinking water is completely unavailable in some areas in Tripoli . '' Crestani said the items needed included dressing materials , external fixators for treating fractures , anaesthetics , antibiotics and tetanus vaccine , but also drugs for chronic diseases such as diabetes , hypertension and cancer . Many cancer drugs had been out of stock for weeks or even months , Crestani said . The shortage of fuel and electricity has also crippled hospitals ' ability to keep health services running . `` It 's a big problem to run ambulances and also some hospitals have been running on generators for the past few days and are really at the end of their capacity . This is really a major problem . '' MSF is just one of many international agencies ready to help Tripoli cope with the aftermath of the fighting . But it 's still not clear whether the `` aftermath '' has arrived . The European Union said on Wednesday it had been preparing for months and was `` geared up for the humanitarian challenge '' , with an initial focus on war surgery and helping hospitals . `` We have prepositioned humanitarian stocks in the accessible zones of Libya and have coordinated all efforts with our humanitarian partners . We are ready , '' Kristalina Georgieva , European Commissioner for International Cooperation , Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response , said in a statement . The Commission has allocated 80 million euros to respond to the Libyan conflict , including 10 million for assistance once Tripoli and the coastal cities opened up for delivery of relief . The Commission was in a position to deliver aid swiftly and efficiently , it said , without saying when this would start . Crestani said MSF teams were on their way from Tunisia and she hoped to give the green light to deploy to Tripoli as soon as possible , and in a few days in the worst case . `` I really hope that it 's not weeks because that will be a real catastrophe . '' Even in the best case scenario , it will take months to restore normality to the health care system , she said . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Miles in Geneva and Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers ; Editing by Mark Heinrich -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "3", "dct": "2011-08-24", "dates": ["2011-08-24", "2011-08-24", "2011-02-01", "2011-02-17", "2011-02-17", "2006-01-01", "2012-02-24", "2012-02-26", "2012-02-28", "2012-03-05", "2012-03-10", "2011-08-25", "2011-03-16", "2012-03-17", "2012-03-19", "2012-03-28", "2012-03-29", "2011-03-30", "2012-04-10", "2011-08-25", "2012-04-30", "2012-05-30", "2012-06-01", "2012-06-08", "2012-06-15", "2011-01-01", "2012-06-27", "2012-07-15", "2012-07-26", "2012-07-27", "2011-07-28", "2011-02-22", "2011-08-09", "2011-08-14", "2011-08-15", "2011-08-16", "2011-08-20", "2011-08-21", "2011-08-22", "2011-08-23"], "text": "Wed Aug 24 , 2011 6:37 pm EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Here is a timeline on the civil war in Libya since protests against the 42-year rule of Muammar Gaddafi began in February : Feb 15\\/16 , 2011 - A riot in Benghazi is triggered by the arrest of human rights activist Fethi Tarbel , who has worked to free political prisoners , Quryna newspaper reports .

Security Council to unfreeze $ 1.5 billion in Libyan assets , a proposal South African has blocked for weeks because it objects to funding the rebel government . The U.S. delegation submitted a draft resolution to the 15-nation body asking it to make the money available for civilian and humanitarian purposes `` as soon as possible . '' No vote was held on the draft on Wednesday , but diplomats said a vote could come on Thursday or Friday . The U.S. move to ask the Security Council to make a decision on a matter that would normally be handled by the council 's Libya sanctions committee came out of frustration with South Africa , which has refused to consent to the idea of handing over large sums directly to Libya 's rebel leaders . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier that the Obama administration wanted to free up funds to provide humanitarian assistance and support to the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- , the rebel government , which controls of most of Libya now thanks to recent gains by rebel fighters . The U.S. draft resolution says the money , currently frozen by the U.S. government on the basis of U.N. sanctions adopted earlier this year , was not to be used for military purposes . `` None of the funds made available pursuant to this resolution will be provided for the purchase of arms , non-lethal military equipment or any other military-related activity , '' the draft text said . Of the $ 1.5 billion , $ 500 million would go to international humanitarian organizations directly , a proposal the South African delegation says it does not object to . Diplomats say the South Africans , however , have problems with the U.S. proposal to hand another $ 1.0 billion to `` third-party vendors supplying fuel and other urgently needed humanitarian goods '' and to what the resolution describes as an `` international mechanism '' for providing social services . The South African objections , diplomats say , have prevented the sanctions committee from approving the U.S. request to release the funds , first submitted to the committee on August 8 . The resolution says fuel from `` third-party vendors '' would not be used for military purposes and that the council would have `` written assurances '' to that effect from the rebel TNC . Several council diplomats told Reuters privately that they were uncomfortable with parts of the U.S. proposal . They said South Africa was not alone in its reservations about handing funds over to the rebels , although it is the only country formally blocking the U.S. request on the sanctions committee . Russia and others have concerns about unfreezing funds for the TNC , they said . South African Ambassador Baso Sangqu told reporters his country was concerned that funding the TNC implied recognizing it , something the African Union had not so far done . Pretoria was awaiting the outcome of an AU meeting on the issue on Thursday before deciding whether to lift its objections , he said . U.N. sanctions committees work on the basis of consensus , which means all 15 Security Council members -- including South Africa -- have a virtual veto . By presenting a resolution to the council , the United States was preparing to bypass the sanctions committee and the need for consensus on its request . Council resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent council members -- the United States , China , France , Britain and Russia -- to pass . If the objections to the U.S. request are lifted in the sanctions committee , there will be no need to vote on the resolution submitted by the U.S. delegation . If the objections remain , Washington will demand a vote , envoys say . The United States alone has frozen some $ 37 billion in Libyan assets , U.S. officials say . The Security Council imposed sanctions in response to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's brutal crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this year . The protests led to a civil war and U.N. approval for NATO intervention . The request for the urgent unfreezing of $ 1.5 billion of sanctioned Libyan assets is separate from the longer-term discussions that will be taking place in Paris , Doha and New York about postwar planning for Libya , including the release of tens of billions of dollars of frozen Libyan funds .

Rumors of Gaddafi or his sons being cornered , even sighted , swirled among excitable rebel fighters engaged in heavy machinegun and rocket exchanges . But two days after his compound was overrun , hopes of a swift end to six months of war were still being frustrated by fierce rearguard actions . Western powers demanded Gaddafi 's surrender and worked to release frozen Libyan state funds , hoping to ease hardships and start reconstruction in the oil-rich state . But with loyalists holding out in the capital , in Gaddafi 's coastal home city and deep in the inland desert , violence could go on for some time , testing the ability of the government-in-waiting to keep order . `` The tribes ... must march on Tripoli , '' Gaddafi said in an audio message broadcast on a sympathetic TV channel . `` Do not leave Tripoli to those rats , kill them , defeat them quickly . `` The enemy is delusional , NATO is retreating , '' he shouted , sounding firmer and clearer than in a similar speech released on Wednesday . Though his enemies believe Gaddafi , 69 , is still in the capital , they fear he could flee by long-prepared escape routes , using tunnels and bunkers , to rally an insurgency . Diehards numbering perhaps in the hundreds were keeping at bay squads of irregular , anti-Gaddafi fighters who had swept into the capital on Sunday and who were now rushing from one site to another , firing assault rifles , machineguns and anti-aircraft cannon bolted to the backs of pick-up trucks . In a southern district close to the notorious prison of Abu Salim , the rebel forces launched a concerted assault , sweeping from house to house and taking prisoners . Elsewhere , pro-Gaddafi forces shelled rebel positions at Tripoli 's airport , and NATO warplanes bombed Sirte to the east -- Gaddafi 's birthplace . While random gunfire broke out periodically across the city , some of its two million residents ventured out to stock up on supplies for the first time in days . Aid agencies sounded an alarm about food , water and also medical supplies , especially for hundreds of wounded . But the new leadership said it had found huge stockpiles in Tripoli which would ease the shortages . In a sign that Libya 's rebel authority was gradually taking over the levers of power from Gaddafi , National Transitional Council official Ali Tarhouni said late on Thursday the body had begun a planned move from the eastern rebel bastion of Benghazi to Tripoli . `` I proclaim the beginning of the resumption of the work of the executive office in Tripoli , '' Tarhouni , who is in charge of oil and financial matters for the council , told reporters at a briefing in the capital . The shift is seen as a crucial step to smoothing over rifts in the country , fragmented by regional and tribal divisions , particularly between east and west . Nonetheless , in order to begin installing an administration in a nation run by an eccentric personality cult for 42 years , to offer jobs to young men now bearing arms and to heal ethnic , tribal and other divisions that have been exacerbated by civil war , Libya 's new masters are anxious for hard cash quickly . The United States and South Africa struck a deal late on Thursday to allow the release of $ 1.5 billion in frozen Libya funds for humanitarian aid and other civilian needs , U.N. diplomats said . Some governments , notably in Africa where there was some sympathy for Gaddafi 's view of his Western enemies as colonialist aggressors , had been reluctant to agree to the deal . After a meeting of officials in Istanbul , the Contact Group of allies against Gaddafi called on Libyans to avoid revenge . `` The participants attached utmost importance to the realization of national reconciliation in Libya , '' it said . `` They agreed that such a process should be based on principles of inclusiveness , avoidance of retribution and vengeance . '' The group also urged the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution freeing up cash quickly . Jibril said the uprising , the bloodiest so far of the Arab Spring , could fall apart if funds were not forthcoming quickly : `` The biggest destabilizing element would be the failure ... to deliver the necessary services and pay the salaries of the people who have not been paid for months . `` Our priorities can not be carried out by the government without having the necessary money immediately , '' he said . Gaddafi 's opponents fear that he may rally an insurgency , as did Saddam Hussein in Iraq , should he remain at large and , perhaps , in control of funds salted away for such a purpose . Western powers , mindful of the bloodshed in Iraq , have made clear they do not want to engage their troops in Libya . But a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Washington would look favorably on any Libyan request for U.N. police assistance -- something some say might aid a transition to democracy . Rebel leaders , offering a million-dollar reward , say the war will be over only when Gaddafi is found , `` dead or alive . '' The ex-international high representative in Bosnia , Paddy Ashdown , told Reuters there was a need for speed if Libya 's new rulers were to avoid a lingering threat from their predecessor , unlike what transpired in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq . `` The best time to capture these defeated leaders is immediately after the conflict finishes , '' Ashdown said . `` The longer it takes the more chance they have of being spirited away to a place which is much more difficult to find . '' The United States and NATO are also deeply concerned about possible looting and resale of weapons from Libyan arsenals as Muammar Gaddafi 's rule crumbles , though the U.S. State Department said it believes Libya 's stocks of concentrated uranium and mustard agent are secure . With fighting raging in Tripoli , there was evidence of the kind of bitter bloodletting in recent days that the rebel leaders are anxious to stop in the interests of uniting Libyans , including former Gaddafi supporters , in a democracy . A Reuters correspondent counted 30 bodies , apparently of troops and gunmen who had fought for Gaddafi , at a site in central Tripoli . At least two had their hands bound . One was strapped to a hospital trolley with a drip still in his arm . All the bodies had been riddled with bullets . Elsewhere , a British medical worker said she had counted 17 bodies who she believed were of prisoners executed by Gaddafi 's forces . One wounded man said he had survived the incident , when , he said , prison guards had sprayed inmates with gunfire on Tuesday as the rebel forces entered Gaddafi 's compound . French magazine Paris Match quoted an intelligence source saying Libyan commandos found evidence that he had stayed at a safe house which they raided on Wednesday . NATO was helping the rebels with intelligence and reconnaissance , Britain said , and its jets kept up their bombing campaign overnight . `` There are areas of resistance by the regime which has had considerable levels of military expertise , still has stockpiles of weapons and still has the ability for command and control , '' said British Defense Minister Liam Fox . `` They may take some time to completely eliminate and it is likely there will be some frustrating days ahead before the Libyan people are completely free of the Gaddafi legacy . '' Nonetheless , many in Tripoli count themselves happy already that Gaddafi has gone . `` I was nine years old when Gaddafi came to power and I 've always hoped I would n't die before I saw this day , '' said Ali Salem al-Gharyani , choking back tears . `` I am now 50 years old and this is the first time , seeing Gaddafi gone , that I have experienced true joy in my life .

With the press focused on scenes of joy in Tripoli and Benghazi , continued skirmishes with regime loyalists , and speculation about where Gaddafi might turn up , it is time to lift our sights and focus on the really difficult transition ahead . If another autocrat succeeds Gaddafi , the transition could be over soon . But if Libya embarks on an effort to create a more democratic state , unified and inclusive in many dimensions , we ll need to wait the better part of a decade to know whether it has succeeded or not . There are no magic formulas for how to go about this . Each contingency has its own requirements . We have seen many more partial failures than full successes : think Iraq and Afghanistan . Certainly in Libya security will be job one . The immediate goal is public order , so that people can move freely without fear of large-scale violence . But there was public order of a non-democratic sort in Gaddafi s Libya . What the rebels have done in areas liberated in recent months is as clever as it is remarkable : they have organized local councils to try to ensure security and other immediate requirements . This does not always happen in civil wars but it suggests a way forward . There were at least four councils in Tripoli before Gaddafi fell . Can they step in to organize local communities to protect themselves from the inevitable aftershocks of Gaddafi s fall ? Even if that works , it is only a temporary expedient . Libya will need a retrained and re-oriented police force , one that seeks to serve and protect rather than intimidate and repress . International assistance in this regard has become the rule rather than the exception , but there is little unused international capacity , because of Afghanistan , Kosovo and other requirements . It is tempting to suggest that Arab countries take on this task , but difficult to imagine that they will do it in a way that encourages the kind of community policing that is needed . Even training and retraining 1,000 per year , it will take at least the better part of a decade to put in place a police force Libyan democracy would want . Even well-trained police are no use if there are no courts where the people they arrest can be fairly tried and sentenced , as well as prisons to put them in . Courts require not only judges but also prosecutors and defense attorneys , not to mention court recorders , registrars and bailiffs . If the formal court system fails to provide fair and rapid justice , Libyans will turn to informal methods of dispute resolution , especially where tribal structures are strong in the countryside . There is nothing inherently wrong with that , but there are difficult issues to be resolved concerning the interaction between tribal and formal justice systems , and the treatment of women in tribal systems . The justice system is an important part of the state , especially in post-war situations , but it is not the only thing that needs fixing . Libya has only rudimentary state institutions apart from the oil ministry . There is no constitution . All power lay in the hands of Gaddafi and his family . So there will be a need to build the state almost from the ground up . There may be advantages in this , as there will be less to sweep away . The Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- that has led the rebellion has published a good , relatively liberal and democratic constitutional charter . But the TNC needs to reformulate itself to be more representative of parts of the country that have been liberated only recently , including Tripoli . And its capability to implement its good intentions is not yet clear . The TNC would like to prepare a new constitution within six months and hold elections within a year to help establish democratic legitimacy . The problem with this idea is that a democratic environment and culture can not be created in such a short time frame , which favors those with an existing organizational infrastructure like Islamists -LRB- who will use the mosques -RRB- and disfavors those with shallower roots in Libyan society , like secularists . This tension is still being played out in Egypt . It might also be wise to consider holding local elections first , since they produce results more immediately reflective of citizens needs and provide a test of both the electoral mechanism and political outcomes . But in the end Libyans will need to decide . I will not be surprised if the one-year time frame gets extended to two , and the real outcomes are not apparent until the second elections , presumably four years later . All this requires money . Libya s economy is essentially 100 per cent dependent on oil and gas . It will take time to get production back up to pre-war levels . In the meanwhile , the TNC will need access to the frozen assets of the Gaddafi regime . This is not a simple matter . In many countries , including the United States , it requires not only a decision of the president but also a presentation to the sanctions committee of the United Nations . There are ample funds well over $ 30 billion are frozen in the United States alone . But getting them to the TNC , and ensuring that they are spent accountably and transparently will not be easy . There are few well established oil and gas producing states that have managed that trick . The people of Libya in the meanwhile are living in dreadful conditions . Food , water , health care and electricity are lacking , especially in vulnerable populations like the poor and displaced . The TNC needs somehow to begin to deliver goods and services , especially in the major cities . Libyans will be celebrating for a few days , but then they are going to start to wonder how they are better off . That is a question that will persist even once immediate needs are satisfied . Ten years from now Libyans will be discussing whether justice has been done to those who committed crimes under the Gaddafi regime , and whether the traumas of that regime and the civil war have been healed . All these decade-long challenges will require an alert and informed Libyan citizenry . The activism and energy that they have shown in resisting the Gaddafi regime needs to be continued and channeled into the development of civil society organizations that can mediate between the citizens and their new state . Hundreds of such organizations have already emerged in Benghazi and other liberated areas . More will emerge in Tripoli . They are vital to keeping a democratic transition on track . The international role in all of this is still unclear . The United States is trying to limit its burdens . It has too much to do elsewhere and no truly vital national interests at stake in Libya , even if it might have some specific interests in preventing Libya from becoming a source of arms trafficking and a haven for international terrorists . European interests are more compelling : oil and gas , related investments , and the desire to prevent migration from Libya becoming an issue in European domestic politics . The Arab League and its members also have an interest in seeing Libya back on its feet as soon as possible . The international community , which so far has based its efforts on UN Security Council resolution 1973 , needs a clear set of goals and a reasonable division of labor to guide it in the future . Getting Libya right in the post-war decade is going to require a lot of European and Arab support , and the Americans need to be ready to pitch in where they have unique capabilities .

Full Article Libya rebel official aims for oil export in 2-3 months TRIPOLI | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 4:41 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Libyan rebel government hopes to restart oil exports within two to three months and reach full volumes in about a year , Ali Tarhouni , the official in charge of financial and oil matters told Reuters from Libya 's oil ministry in Tripoli . It was the first time an official from the rebel National Transitional Authority was seen in the capital taking up the reins of government , after rebel fighters swept into the city four days ago aiming to topple Muammar Gaddafi . `` The NOC -LRB- National Oil Corporation -RRB- initial estimate is that we can have about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels within two to three months . And then we ramp this up to the normal , which is about 1.6 -LRB- million -RRB- . My expectation is that this will be done within a year or so , '' Tarhouni said . Damage on most of Libya 's oilfields from the civil war has been minimal , he said . `` The state of the oil fields are a lot better than expected , '' he said . `` Overall if we want to put a number on it , the average is about 10 percent or so . Most of the fields are more than 90 percent fine . '' He added that Libya would continue to honor existing contracts with oil companies . Asked if there would be any block for companies from countries that had not supported the rebels , he responded : `` Not that I know of . '' `` We have contracts with most of the major companies . Wintershall , Shell , Repsol , Eni . We have n't signed any new contracts . These are pre-revolution contracts . We are going to continue those '' . He also said it was too early to discuss awarding any new contracts : `` It 's the last thing on my mind . '' `` We 're just going to put back things as they used to be . The NOC is the one that is practically running the oil industry . We will restructure that to make sure that it 's nimble . '' Asked who will be running the oil industry for the foreseeable future until a general election , Tarhouni said : `` I 'm in charge until they decide to use somebody else . '' Tarhouni , formerly a U.S.-based academic and opposition figure in exile , returned to take charge of economic , financial and oil matters on the rebels ' executive committee .

LONDON | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 4:18 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil prices are likely to stay above $ 100 a barrel next year despite increasing downward pressure from the expected return of some Libyan production and fears of a double-dip recession , a Reuters poll showed . According to 29 analysts polled by Reuters , Brent crude prices will average $ 107.90 a barrel in 2012 , down from the forecast of $ 109.30 a barrel in last month 's poll . U.S. light crude oil , also known as West Texas Intermediate -LRB- WTI -RRB- , will average $ 96.30 a barrel next year , down from a forecast of $ 99.40 a barrel last month . Despite doubts about how fast Libyan oil production could restart as fighting between rebels and loyalists to Muammar Gaddafi continues in Tripoli , analysts are beginning to account for some output in the medium term . `` The possible comeback of Libya as oil exporter after half a year of civil war will lead to even more oil supply , '' LBBW analyst Frank Schallenberger said . `` On the other hand , the slowing down of the global economy will limit demand . '' A flurry of poor economic data from the United States and Europe in the past week has already led to a sharp correction in risk assets . In the short-term the market will focus on a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday for hints of more quantitative easing , but U.S. investment bank Citigroup -LRB- C. N -RRB- noted this week that even if the United States printed more money , weak economic growth and fresh supplies from Libya would weigh on prices . `` If crude prices have been retreating in August , it was not because of positive expectations on the restart of crude oil exports from Libya but on negative expectations about oil demand , '' Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix said in a note . Brent crude futures were trading above $ 110 a barrel on Friday morning . `` Growth expectations are likely to be in focus , and Bernanke 's much anticipated speech is likely to play a pivotal role for near-term price direction across all asset classes , '' said Gain Capital Forex.com analyst Daniel Hwang . The previous round of quantitative easing announced a year ago has led to a sharp boost in commodity prices but has failed to revive growth of the world 's largest economy . In the euro zone , the latest data from economic powerhouse Germany showed a steep drop in business confidence and worries about the fiscal troubles ripping through the common currency area . `` The month of August has seen one of the most dramatic turnarounds in the outlook for the global economy in living memory . Continued political squabbling , combined with poor historical economic data released around the turn of the month , led to a dramatic collapse in financial market sentiment , with many risk assets experiencing the largest falls since the period immediately following the collapse of Lehman in September 2008 , '' Credit Suisse analysts said . Analyst Davide Tabarelli from Nomisma Energy expected oil prices to shed a political risk premium gained on the back of the Libyan conflict . `` Prices increased by $ 20 because of Libya ; now they should fall by at least that portion , '' Tabarelli said , adding it could take around three months to bring production in line with previous levels . But Tabarelli was in the minority . Four out of five analysts in the Reuters poll still saw 2012 Brent prices above $ 100 . `` With the resumption of supplies from Libya , the oil price could come under pressure in the coming months , though it is unlikely to fall below $ 100 per barrel for long , '' Commerzbank analysts said in a note . The fall in prices should also help tighten the gap between Brent and U.S. light crude prices to an average of $ 11.60 per barrel in 2012 from around $ 24.90 a barrel currently . Despite an expected correction of feedstock prices , Petromatrix 's Jakob warned that product prices remained at high levels that are hampering demand , and the trickle of downward revisions to oil demand projections was underway . The latest available data from MasterCard showed U.S. retail gasoline demand fell last week despite a drop in pump prices , in what analysts warned had been a difficult driving season . -LRB- Reporting by Zaida Espana ; Polling by Bangalore Unit ; Editing by -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "67", "dct": "2011-08-26", "dates": ["2011-08-26", "2011-08-26", "2011-08-26", "2011-08-23", "2011-08-25", "2011-08-22", "2011-08-19"], "text": "TRIPOLI | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 6:23 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels claimed to be close to capturing Muammar Gaddafi on Friday as their NATO backers bombed diehard loyalists in his tribal bastion , but there was no sign of an end to the war , or to international wrangling over Libya 's riches . Leaders of the National Transitional Council , which has Western support , pressed foreign governments to release Libyan funds frozen abroad , warning of its urgent need to impose order and provide services to a population traumatized by six months of conflict and 42 years of eccentric , personal rule . But Gaddafi 's long-time allies in Africa , beneficiaries of his oil-fueled largesse and sympathizers with a foreign policy he called anti-colonial , offered the fugitive strongman a grain of comfort and irked the rebels by refusing to follow Arab and Western powers in recognizing the NTC as the legal government . Combined with the reluctance of major powers like China , Russia and Brazil , to see Europeans and Americans dominate a nation with Africa 's biggest oil reserves , the African Union 's resistance may slow the pace at which funds are released . Mahmoud Jibril , head of the government in waiting , said time was short . Visiting NATO member Turkey , he said : `` We have to establish an army , strong police force to be able meet the needs of the people and we need capital and we need the assets . `` All our friends in the international community speak of stability and security . We need that too . '' While many African states have recognized the NTC , the AU would not do so as long as fighting continued , South African President Jacob Zuma , a vocal advocate for Gaddafi , said after a meeting in Addis Ababa at which the AU called for all sides in the conflict to negotiate a peace and work for democracy . `` If there is fighting , there is fighting , '' Zuma said . `` The process is fluid . That 's part of what we inform countries -- whether there is an authority to recognize . '' Rebel leaders are determined to show they are in charge , though estimates vary of when the TNC will move formally from its Benghazi base in the east to the war zone that is Tripoli . `` We have come to operate the country . We are now the legal authority , '' declared Mohammed al-Alagi , a lawyer who has been the TNC 's justice minister for some months , as he met foreign journalists in the capital wearing a rebel flag as a bandana . Other TNC leaders , who stress they want to work with other rebel groups which sprang up later in the west as well with those who have previously supported Gaddafi , say the war will only be over once the fallen leader is caught , `` dead or alive . '' Alagi voiced confidence that Gaddafi and his entourage of sons and aides was surrounded and would soon be captured : `` The area where he is now is under siege , '' he told Reuters , while declining to say where in Tripoli he thought Gaddafi was . `` The rebels are monitoring the area and they are dealing with it . '' Similar confidence has proved misplaced since the irregular armies overran Gaddafi 's compound on Tuesday , however , and analysts do not rule out that the 69-year-old , a veteran master of surprise , might have slipped away to rally supporters for an insurgency . He has not been seen in public for two months , but made a defiant audio broadcast on Thursday . Colonel Hisham Buhagiar of the rebel force in the capital said Libyan commandos were targeting several areas : `` We are sending special forces every day to hunt down Gaddafi . We have one unit that does intelligence and other units that hunt him . '' NATO forces , notably from France and Britain , are helping the rebels . Many analysts assume they are giving intelligence and may have their own special forces troops on the ground . Despite sporadic gunfire as rebel fighters tried to take pockets of loyalist resistance , Tripoli was quieter than in recent days . Dead bodies , the stench of rotting garbage in the oppressive summer heat , wrecked cars and the other detritus of war were evidence of frantic battles and wildly erratic firing . Some of Tripoli 's two million people , suffering from power cuts , dwindling supplies and a critical shortage of medical supplies and healthcare , ventured out to local mosques , some praying Gaddafi can be found by Monday , when Muslims mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan with the festival of Eid . `` Gaddafi is the biggest criminal and dictator and we hope we will find him before the end of Ramadan , '' said Milad Abu Aisha , a 60-year-old pensioner who joined friends at his local mosque for traditional worship on the last Friday of Ramadan . `` It will be the happiest Eid in 42 years , '' said Mohammed al-Misrati , a 52-year-old office worker who was among hundreds streaming toward the mosque under the protection of armed local men who have formed ad hoc security units across the capital . `` We have a taste of freedom after 42 years of repression . '' British aircraft fired cruise missiles at a headquarters bunker overnight in Gaddafi 's birthplace of Sirte . A city beyond rebel control , on the Mediterranean coast 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , some believe he might seek refuge there among his tribesmen . Loyalist forces also still hold positions deep in the Sahara desert . `` Sirte remains an operating base from which pro-Gaddafi troops project hostile forces against Misrata and Tripoli , '' a NATO official said , adding that its forces had also acted to stop a column of 29 vehicles heading west toward Misrata . In Benghazi , rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani said the bombing in Sirte was aimed at ammunition stores and depots for Scud missiles . `` Maybe the mercenaries will run away , '' he said , referring to suggestions Gaddafi 's forces include hired fighters from Chad and other sub-Saharan African countries . `` After this bombing , maybe the people there will try to rise up . '' he added , saying TNC commanders were also in contact with tribal chiefs in Sirte , hoping to avoid bloodshed . Such negotiations will be a major challenge across the country for Libya 's new rulers as they try to meet expectations of young men now bearing arms and to heal ethnic , tribal and other divisions that have been exacerbated by civil war . -LRB- Reporting by Peter Graff , Ulf Laessing , Mohammed Abbas , and Samia Nakhoul in Tripoli ; Robert Birsel , Emma Farge and Alexander Dziadosz in Benghazi , Barry Malone in Addis Ababa , Hamid Ould Ahmed and Marie-Louise Gumuchian in Algiers , Giles Elgood , Christian Lowe , Tarek Amara and Richard Valdmanis in Tunis , ; Ibon Villelabeitia in Ankara , Jon Hemming in London , Arshad Mohammed in Washington and Justyna Pawlak in Brussels ; Writing by Alastair Macdonald -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The fugitive Gaddafi 's exact whereabouts where still not known and it was possible he was still in hiding in Tripoli , five days after it fell to rebel forces and his 42-year-old reign collapsed . NATO war planes struck at Sirte , on the Mediterranean coast , for a third day on Sunday , a spokesman for the multi-national alliance said in Brussels . `` We 're paying close attention to what 's happening in Sirte because we know that there are remnants of the regime that are there , '' the spokesman said . On the ground , rebel forces also closed in and said they would seize Sirte by force if negotiations for its surrender failed . Gaddafi was born near Sirte , 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , in 1942 and after he seized power in 1969 he built it up from a sleepy fishing village into an important city and power center of 100,000 people . He still retains support and sympathy there , so whether or not he has chosen to retreat to the city to make a last stand , its capture will still be strategically and symbolically important to the rebels as they consolidate their victory . One rebel commander said his forces were within 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- of Sirte from the east and others were advancing from the west . On the coastal highway east of Tripoli , tank transporters were carrying Soviet-designed T-55 tanks in the direction of Sirte . Rebels said the tanks were seized from an abandoned military base in Zlitan . Jamal Tunally , a rebel military commander in Misrata , told Reuters : `` The front line is 30 km from Sirte . We think the Sirte situation will be resolved peacefully , God willing . '' `` Now we just need to find Gaddafi . I think he is still hiding underneath Bab al-Aziziyah like a rat , '' said Tunally , referring to Gaddafi 's compound in Tripoli which rebels overran on Tuesday . In the east , rebel fighters pushed 7 km -LRB- 4 miles -RRB- past the village of Bin Jawad and secured the Nawfaliyah junction , a rebel spokesman said . `` We 're going slowly , '' spokesman Mohammad Zawawi told Reuters . `` We want to give more time for negotiations , to give a chance for those people trying to persuade the people inside Sirte to surrender and open their city . '' In Tripoli , the rebel leadership sought to establish control after days of confusion and sporadic skirmishing with the remnants of Gaddafi 's forces . Several explosions and intermittent gunfire were heard overnight Sunday . The stench of rotting bodies and burning garbage still hung over the city and food , water and other supplies were running short , indications that despite the euphoria of victory , plenty of challenges lay ahead . Gaddafi , 69 , is on the run and the fear among his foes is that he intends to lead an insurgency against them . NTC officials rejected any idea of talks with him , saying he was a criminal who must be brought to justice . `` We did not negotiate when we were weak , and we wo n't negotiate now that we have liberated all of Libya , '' NTC information minister Mahmoud Shammam told a news conference . The Associated Press earlier quoted Gaddafi 's spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , as saying Gaddafi was still in Libya and wanted to discuss forming a transitional government with the NTC . NTC officials say Gaddafi , his son Saif al-Islam and his spy chief should be tried in Libya , although they are wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity . The NTC and its Western backers are acutely aware of the need to prevent Libya collapsing into the kind of chaos that plagued Iraq for years after the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 . The de facto government , whose leaders plan to move to Tripoli from Benghazi this week , is trying to impose security , restore basic services and revive the energy -- based economy . But in the aftermath of victory , many corpses have been found , some of slain Gaddafi soldiers , others the victims of killings in cold blood . A Libyan official said 75 bodies had been found at the Abu Salim hospital , which was caught up in heavy fighting , and another 35 corpses were found at the Yurmuk hospital . The possibility that rebel fighters executed captured Gaddafi soldiers would pose an image problem for the NTC . Rebel military spokesman Colonel Ahmed Bani said there was concern for the fate of 40,000 prisoners who he said had been detained by Gaddafi 's forces and who were still unaccounted for . It was possible some were being held in underground bunkers in Tripoli that rebels had been unable to locate . In good omens for economic recovery , officials said a vital gas export pipeline to Europe had been repaired and Libya 's biggest refinery had survived the war intact . In the west , Tunisian authorities reopened the main border crossing into Libya , restoring a supply route for Tripoli , after Gaddafi forces were driven out on Friday . That should help relieve a looming humanitarian crisis in the city , where food , drinking water and medicines are scarce . Trucks loaded with food and other goods were already moving across the Ras Jdir crossing toward Tripoli , about two hours ' drive away . Tripoli residents queued for bread or scoured grocery shops for food . Many took a stoical view of their plight . `` This is a tax we pay for our freedom , '' said Sanusi Idhan , a layer waiting to buy food . The NTC issued messages urging electricity workers to get back to work and efforts to pay the salaries of public sector workers were underway .

Yes , there indeed are several divisions of black Africans and citizens of Chad in the army of Libya , that is formed on the principle of territorial militia . But they can hardly be considered mercenaries -- not more than French Foreign Legion or non-American citizens in US Army . In general , the status of black men of Libyan army 's various units is civil servants . In a country with 6 million inhabitants , one third are black -LRB- the most oppressed group in the country -RRB- . Would not it be easier for the rebels to call for their solidarity and ask them join the rebel ranks ? But not only black Libyans do not join the rebellion -- they flee in terror . The first wave of reports and evidence of beatings of black Africans began in February and March . The rebels , under the trademark of fighting with the mercenaries from Chad , were slaughtering all black people with no mercy . Back in early March , the Human Rights Watch even warned black migrant workers on the need to flee the revolutionary terrain . `` We left behind our friends from Chad . We left behind their bodies . We had 70 or 80 people from Chad working for our company . They cut them dead with pruning shears and axes , attacking them , saying you 're providing troops for Gaddafi . The Sudanese , the Chadians were massacred . We saw it ourselves . I am a worker , not a fighter . They took me from my house and -LRB- raped -RRB- my wife '' , -- a Turkish oilfield worker , who fled Libya , told BBC in February 25 . One of the editors of the Monthly Review , Yoshie Furuhashi , writes : `` The black African workers now live in fear in the territories held by the rebels in Libya . Some have been attacked by mobs , some have been imprisoned and some of their houses and shops have been torched . Many African workers say they felt safer under the regime of Gaddafi '' . In March , a reporter from the Daily Mail was in Benghazi and reported : `` Africans I saw ranged from a 20 year old and a late forties , with a grizzled beard . Most wore casual clothes . When they realized that I spoke English erupted in protests . `` We did nothing , '' one told me , before he was silenced . `` We are all construction workers in Ghana . Do not harm anyone . '' Another accused , a man in green overalls , showed the paint on their sleeves and said : `` This is my job . I do not know how to shoot a gun '' Abdul Nasser , 47 , protested : `` They lie about us . They took us out of our house at night when we were asleep . '' While still complaining , they were taken . International Business Times published an article on March 2 that says : `` According to reports , over 150 black Africans at least a dozen different countries escaped from Libya by plane and landed at the airport in Nairobi , Kenya , with horrific stories of violence . '' `` We were attacked by locals who said they were mercenaries who killed people . I mean blacks who refused to see `` Julius told Reuters Kiluu , a construction supervisor for 60 years . Michel Collon with a fact-finding delegation were in Libya in July and when he learned what had happened , he said : `` I met these people during my research in Tripoli . I could talk to some people . They were not `` mercenaries , '' as the rebels and the media tell . Some were dark-skinned Libyans -LRB- much of the population is of African type , in fact -RRB- , others were black civilians from African countries who stayed in Libya for a long time . All support Gaddafi precisely because he opposes to racism and treats them as Arabs and Africans on an equal footing . On the contrary , the rebels in Benghazi are known for their racism , and blacks were victims of terrible systematic atrocities . The paradox is that NATO wants to bring democracy to a section of Al Qaeda and Libyan Ku Klux Klan-type racists '' . Twitter explodes with rebels ' messages about killing `` African mercenaries '' . In the chaos of embattled Tripoli , black people are being simply seized from the streets and taken somewhere openly . On the photo above we can see that the dead people 's hands are tied with plastic handcuffs and their clothes are relatively clean . This means these people were captured not after a fight , but deliberately . The Colonel was being building good relations with the south of Africa . NATO plan of destabilizing Libya might as well include having the black Africans turning away from this country forever , using contempt and xenophobia of the rebels as a driving force of the persecution . After all , lynching black people simply for being in Africa sounds ridiculous . But results are pretty much of the same racist kind , and they are not funny at all . @invictuss , by characterizing one person in a movement of perhaps millions with links to AL-Qaeda , you are not proving the whole movement is bad . That is assuming you are even correct . That would be like saying all Americans are Al-Qaeda sympathizers just because one American citizen is a member , and there are many . Back to point of article , so far it has been mostly good news out of Libya in last week , let us hope this trend continues and the Libyans can form a solid , democratic government of their own doing .

Oil production in the OPEC country has been at a virtual stand-still for months as clashes between rebels and troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi have damaged infrastructure and caused foreign workers to flee . This has forced global economies to pay more than $ 100 a barrel for Brent crude since the civil war began in February and driven up import costs for major buyers like Italy , Germany and France . `` Operations will start on September 15 and by the end of the month we will have the capability to export from Tobruk , '' Abdeljalil Mayuf , spokesman for Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- told Reuters , referring to the Sarir and Mesla fields deep in the Libyan desert . He said technical teams would be sent out to the fields after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends , in the first week of September . Initial production will be at around 60,000-100 ,000 barrels per day and any further increase would depend on the condition of underground wells , he said . Some of this oil will be used to feed AGOCO refineries in east Libya once they restart , he said . The oilfields in eastern Libya were damaged by troops loyal to Gaddafi during the country 's civil war , killing 14 oil workers . The damage has now been repaired , AGOCO said , while rebel officials say they have set up a special security force to protect oil infrastructure from saboteurs . Around 80 percent of Libyan oil fields are in the east of the country around the Sirte basin , with rebel fighters now in control of the key oil ports of Brega and Ras Lanuf . AGOCO has a total production capacity of around 420,000 barrels per day , or around a quarter of the country 's total output before the war began . Mayuf did not say if former supply contracts negotiated before the war would be respected . `` This will be arranged with the marketing department . There are many clients to choose from .

Paolo Scaroni is the first oil chief to visit the war-torn country since rebels took the capital Tripoli , in a move widely seen as an effort to secure Eni 's stake in Libya , which has Africa 's biggest oil reserves . `` He is in Benghazi and meeting with the head of the National Oil Company . They are discussing Eni 's interests in Libya , '' National Transition Council spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told Reuters . Eni was the largest foreign oil producer in the North African country before the civil war and is keen to mend relations with rebel leaders after hesitant Italian support for the uprising in its early stages . The firm is expected to offer emergency fuel supplies to Libya in an effort to help rebels consolidate their control . A western diplomatic source told Reuters that payment for the fuel would come out of the $ 8 billion of Libyan assets that Italy froze as part of sanctions against Muammar Gaddafi , whose 42-year rule appears to have come to an end .

While the rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi has stirred concern abroad about the fate of Libya 's aging chemical weapons stockpiles , Israel has no indication Hamas or other Palestinian factions have sought these , the officials said . Instead , Israeli officials have detected an inflow of SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles and rocket-propelled grenades -LRB- RPGs -RRB- , said one official , describing an overland supply route that opened up between eastern Libya -- after it fell to the rebels -- and the Gaza Strip via Egypt . `` We 've been seeing more SA-7s and RPGs coming across , '' said the official . `` It 's not a major qualitative enhancement for them .

Algerian officials highlighted the plight of the expectant mother in explaining a decision to give refuge to the fugitive Libyan ex-leader 's wife and three of her children on Monday -- a move denounced by the country 's new rulers as an act of aggression . The child was born in Djanet , according to two Algerian official sources . An oasis deep in the Sahara , Djanet lies about 60 km -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- from the Libyan frontier and 500 km southwest of Sabha , one of the last bastions of support for Aisha Gaddafi 's 69-year-old father . `` Gaddafi 's daughter gave birth to a girl today , '' a source close to the Algerian health ministry , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . `` This is all I can say . '' Aisha Gaddafi , a lawyer in her mid-30s about whom little information can be confirmed , was on the very point of giving birth when the family appealed to cross the border , another Algerian source said . That humanitarian consideration was the main reason for them being allowed in , the source added . Algeria 's ambassador to the United Nations , Mourad Benmehidi , told the BBC that in the desert regions there was a `` holy rule of hospitality . '' Analysts say the government in Algiers is wary of popular unrest in other Arab states and fears its own Islamist enemies may find support in the new Libya . However , a local newspaper in Algiers reported that Algeria would hand over Muammar Gaddafi to the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- if he himself entered the country . Another paper said part of the Libyan border would be closed . Gaddafi 's wife Safia and sons Hannibal and Mohammed were also in the party given refuge . Libya 's ruling council demanded them back for trial . But only Gaddafi himself , his son Saif al-Islam and a senior aide , who are both also in unaccounted for , are subject to an international arrest warrant for war crimes . Gaddafi 's only daughter who was not adopted , Aisha ran a charitable foundation and in 2004 joined a team of lawyers defending former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . There had been no public announcement that she was expecting a child . Aisha largely stayed out of Libyan politics , but since the start of a revolt against her father 's rule in February she appeared at pro-Gaddafi rallies and gave interviews in which she accused NATO of killing Libyan children . Quoting Algerian sources , the Echorouk newspaper said on its website that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had told government ministers at a cabinet meeting on Monday Algeria would respect international law on all matters related to the Libyan conflict . `` Should Gaddafi try to enter Algerian soil ... Algeria would arrest him and hand him over to the International Criminal Court in compliance with international agreements , '' the newspaper said . It said the decision was not a reaction to the toppling of Gaddafi but was in accordance with the ICC 's arrest warrants . No one was immediately available from the government for comment . In a separate report , Echorouk said Gaddafi 's family would not be allowed to go to the capital Algiers . Algeria 's El Watan newspaper said the country was closing the southern part of its border with Libya . Quoting diplomatic sources , El Watan said an instruction had gone out to security services to close the southern part of the border with Libya because of the `` precarious situation '' there . Algeria 's border with Libya is hundreds of kilometers long and stretches through expanses of empty desert . Algerian officials say they are concerned that Islamist militants have infiltrated Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- and that al Qaeda 's North African wing will exploit the chaos in Libya to acquire weapons and explosives .

Misrata was liberated by rebels in May after a fierce three-month battle , and they now control most of the country . `` The abuses that we gathered evidence of in Misrata are some of the most egregious war crimes and crimes against humanity I 've heard of in Libya , '' said Richard Sollom , deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights and author of the report . `` There has been some evidence of crimes committed by rebel forces , but certainly nothing anywhere near as widespread and systematic as those committed by Gaddafi 's forces . '' A single act can be deemed a war crime , but when troops commit `` systematic and widespread '' crimes against civilians , that is a crime against humanity , Sollom said . As evidence of one such crime , the report includes a copy of a government order for troops to prevent fuel and supplies reaching the city of some 400,000 to 500,000 people . The crimes detailed in the report are also consistent with what residents told Reuters reporters in Misrata during the summer and with video evidence provide by a member of the new city council 's media committee . For the report , the group focused on Misrata plus two towns immediately to the south of the city -- Kerzaz and Tomina -- which Sollom said were used as bases for Gaddafi loyalists during the government 's bombardment of the city . People interviewed for the report cited cases of torture , summary executions and allegations that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians , hospitals and mosques . The report mentions the case of Mohammed , a civilian resident of the town of Kerzaz , who was left blind in one eye and suffered a broken jaw that he said he sustained while being tortured by government soldiers . Video footage provided to Reuters shows at least one apparent rocket attack on a hospital , in which a room full of incubators for premature infants was hit . Rebel fighters also showed a team of Reuters reporters in late July a mosque on Misrata 's western front in the town of Dafniya , which they said had been targeted by Gaddafi loyalists . There were holes caused by tank and rocket fire on the west side of the mosque 's minaret -- indicating that government troops had inflicted the damage . And in interviews residents of Misrata told Reuters in July that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians . `` Gaddafi 's aim here was to kill as many people as he had to in Misrata in order to stay in power , '' said Fauzi al-Karshaine , a local businessman who was shot five time by Gaddafi troops on February 19 during a protest for greater freedoms by unarmed people in Misrata . `` He does not care how many innocent women and children he has to kill to do it . '' In June the International Criminal Court issued indictments against Gaddafi , his son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam and Libyan intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi . Physicians for Human Rights recommends that to move forward , post-Gaddafi Libya must come to terms with its past and prosecute individuals suspected of having committed war crimes during the country 's internecine conflict . `` The -LRB- ruling rebel -RRB- National Transitional Council has been saying the right things about moving forward and prosecuting war crimes , '' Sollom said . `` But eventually Libya will have to deal with its past and hold individual perpetrators accountable .

Russia , which was critical of NATO 's operation in Libya , announced its decision as leaders and envoys from world powers and international bodies gathered in Paris to coordinate Libya 's political and economic reconstruction . Moscow had billions of dollars worth of arms , energy and infrastructure deals with Libya under its deposed leader Muammar Gaddafi , and Russian officials have expressed concern they could be lost in the transition . `` We proceed from the position that all previously agreed treaties and other mutual obligations ... will be implemented in good faith , '' the Foreign Ministry said . Russia allowed Western military intervention in Libya to go ahead by abstaining from a U.N. Security Council resolution vote in March , but then repeatedly accused NATO forces carrying out air strikes of overstepping their mandate to protect civilians and of siding with anti-Gaddafi forces in the civil war . President Dmitry Medvedev , however , joined Western nations in urging Gaddafi to give up power and made clear he could not seek refuge in Russia . Nonetheless , some in Libya have signaled that the new authorities could slight nations like Russia and China in favor of those that gave more support to Gaddafi 's foes . Russia 's representative at the Paris talks , Medvedev 's special Africa envoy Mikhail Margelov , said he was confident that would not happen . `` I do n't think the new government of Libya will start off by evaluating contracts with Russia on political rather than technical and economic criteria , '' the Interfax news agency quoted Margelov as saying . Last week , Medvedev called for talks between Gaddafi 's backers and opponents , and suggested that Russia would recognize the NTC if it was able to `` unite the country for a new democratic start . '' The Foreign Ministry statement urged the council to carry out its `` declared reform program , which calls for the development of a new constitution , the holding of general elections and the formation of a government . '' Russia 's NATO envoy , Dmitry Rogozin , warned on Wednesday that unity among anti-Gaddafi forces would not last and said further Western military intervention was likely . `` As soon as the common enemy is defeated , the opposition will unavoidably meet with internal disagreements , '' Rogozin told Russia Today television . `` And I am certain that at that moment certain Western countries will try to provide themselves with a military presence in order to get control over Libya 's oil reserves .

A day after international powers met in Paris and agreed to hand over more than $ 15 billion to the rebels who overthrew Gaddafi the European Union rescinded a range of sanctions and officials from the National Transitional Council explained their rebuilding plans . The NTC representative in London said that work on putting right the damage of 42 years of eccentric one-man rule and of six months of civil war should not wait until Gaddafi is found and the last bastions of armed support for him are defeated . `` As long as Tripoli , the capital , is stabilized and secure and safe , which it almost is now , and the overwhelming majority of other cities and towns , then Libyans can get on with the process of transition and stabilization and the new political process , '' Guma El-Gamaty told the BBC . In the eastern city of Benghazi , seat of the uprising , an NTC official said the release of the funds meant the NTC now had to show Libyans it was capable of governing . `` Before we had the excuse that we did n't have money when things went wrong , '' he said . `` Now we do n't have the excuse . '' Gamaty reaffirmed the council 's commitment to a `` clear road map '' to democracy , including a constitution to be drafted within eight months , a referendum and then full elections in 2013 . `` By the end of about 20 months the Libyan people will have elected the leaders they want to lead their country , '' he said . As the rebels hunt Gaddafi , a spokesman for his son Saif al-Islam said he has been traveling around close to Tripoli , meeting tribal leaders and preparing to retake the capital . In a telephone call to Reuters in Tunisia from what he said was a `` southern suburb of Tripoli , '' Moussa Ibrahim derided the ability of the NTC to run the country and said their Western backers should negotiate with the ousted leader . There was no way to verify his comments which , like those broadcast this week by Gaddafi himself , serve as a public reminder to Libyans he remains at large and may pose a threat , at least by means of a guerrilla war , to the new authorities . Echoing comments made by Gaddafi and his son in recent broadcasts from hiding , Ibrahim said : `` Our army still controls many regions of Libya . We will be able to capture Tripoli back and many other cities in the near future . The fight is very , very far from over . Within even a few weeks , a few months , even a couple of years , we will have Libya back . '' In Tripoli , life was returning to normal . Municipal street sweepers picked up litter and spent bullet casings on Martyrs Square , known under Gaddafi as Green Square . NTC fighters had removed some roadblocks on a main road along the shoreline and more foodstores were open , although water supplies and power remained erratic . Several thousands of people , mainly women , later gathered in the square singing a new national anthem and carrying banners , which read `` For the first time we are free . '' NTC education chief Soliman el-Sahli told Reuters that schools would reopen on September 17 , despite some bombed-out classrooms , scarce transport and a curriculum until this year based on Gaddafi 's personal `` Green Book '' -- an eclectic account of the `` Brother Leader 's '' views of the world . One unknown in the process of installing an elected president and parliament is when the timetable will start running . The council road map says the process would begin once the NTC declares Libya `` liberated '' from Gaddafi . Its leaders have said the war will not end until he is found `` dead or alive '' so it is unclear when liberation might be achieved . On Thursday , the 42nd anniversary of the military coup which brought him to power as a 27-year-old army captain , Gaddafi , who is now 69 , declared his defiance in messages on satellite television . NTC commanders say they think he is hiding in the tribal bastion of Bani Walid , some 100 miles southeast of Tripoli . There are also suggestions he may be in his hometown of Sirte on the coast , or indeed elsewhere . `` Let it be a long battle . We will fight from place to place , from town to town , from valley to valley , from mountain to mountain , '' Gaddafi said in one message . In later comments he threatened urban warfare . NTC commanders say they are taking their time trying to cajole pro-Gaddafi holdouts like Bani Walid and Sirte into surrender in the interest of sparing further bloodshed . A Libyan from Bani Walid said he had been in sporadic contact this week with people in the city . `` I know that two months ago most of the family , the younger children , were staying in Bani Walid , '' said the source , who spoke on condition he was not identified . NATO said it had carried out air strikes on Thursday in the vicinity of Sirte and Bani Walid . In Libya 's third largest city Misrata , rebels said they were reinforcing security to intercept Gaddafi supporters trying to infiltrate the area from their haven in Sirte . `` There are Gaddafi scouts everywhere , '' said Ibrahim Obaid , a rebel fighter . The NTC 's reconstruction minister , Ahmad Jehani , and Aref Nayed , a member of the council 's rebuilding team , met experts in post-conflict rebuilding from groups including the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and USAID in Paris on Friday . U.S. and French officials said the meeting was mainly about listening to the council 's needs . The rebel officials said Libya is counting on quickly restoring oil production to revive its economy . Five foreign oil firms are already back and working to resume operations . `` The issue of damage is not much and you can get procurement very fast . This is helped by the fact the producing wells are under contract to international firms , if they feel they can deploy their people , '' Jehani said . Despite having access to some of the tens of billions of dollars Gaddafi had invested abroad , the new leaders will also need short-term aid and longer-term loans to help stave off a humanitarian crisis . In order for Libya 's new leaders to obtain aid from bodies such as the World Bank , they will need to be recognized by the IMF , which says such a move must be supported by its 187 members . Though dozens of countries have followed the Western powers in recognizing the NTC as Libya 's legitimate government , others have had qualms about the use of NATO force to oust Gaddafi . Many African and developing countries are still uneasy with a process that reminds some of the U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , even if Western leaders are at extreme pains to deny any plan to send in troops or run Libya for the Libyans . Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota of Brazil , which has not recognized the NTC said this month 's U.N. General Assembly would settle the matter of recognition . The European Union 's Official Journal listed 28 Libyan entities freed from EU sanctions as work gets under way to send in supplies and export oil through ports previously controlled by Gaddaf . EU foreign ministers meeting in Poland were to discuss how to help to stabilize Libya . European powers ended a long standoff with Gaddafi in recent years as he scaled back hostility in return for the development of oil and gas exports . Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Europe saw the new Libya as a major energy supplier and ally . `` Libya is potentially a wealthy country , key because of Europe 's drive to diversify energy sources . '' The huge numbers of weapons circulating in a postwar Libya with unsecured borders pose a risk to Europe and other nations , the European Union 's senior representative in Tripoli said . Agostino Miozzo , special representative of EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton , told Reuters the bloc wanted to see the NTC tackle the security problem by swiftly establishing control over its borders and reorganizing the armed forces . -LRB- Reporting by Christian Lowe and Mohammed Abbas in Tripoli , Maria Golovnina in Misrata , Emma Farge , Sherine El Madany and Alex Dziadosz in Benghazi , Stephen Addison in London , John Irish and Catherine Bremer in Paris , Gabriela Baczynska and David Brunnstrom in Sopot , Poland , Tsvetelia Tsolova in Sofia , Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Alastair Macdonald in Tunis ; Writing by Alastair Macdonald -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Days later , the Soviet-made rocket , loaded on its launch truck and pointing toward the Libyan capital , is still sitting under the eucalyptus trees where they left it . The motley rebel forces who overthrew Gaddafi two weeks ago have set up no guard to prevent anyone taking it away or looting it for parts . Western powers and Libya 's neighbors fear that the power vacuum could allow huge quantities of unsecured weapons left over from the civil war to end up in the hands of Islamist militants , in particular the North African branch of al Qaeda . Officials with Libya 's interim government , the National Transitional Council , say they are trying to secure these weapons . But there was little evidence of that at the Scud site , in farmland about 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli . Abdelhamid Omar Derbek , a colonel at the local anti-Gaddafi military headquarters , said he and his men visit the site several times a day . `` I patrol here ... and there is another shift that does it as well , '' said Derbek , who had a Kalashnikov rifle slung over his shoulder but whose military rank was not evident from his outfit of yellow Lacoste T-shirt , jeans and sandals . For all his assertions of supervision , however , Derbek is based at a military facility about 15 km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- away . He drove with a team of Reuters journalists from his camp to the site on Sunday but there was no one stationed there to guard it . A group of curious local people were looking around . `` I heard about it last night and I wanted to come and take a picture , '' said one of the visitors , who said he worked for an oil company . A Scud-launching complex , consisting of an 11-meter -LRB- 33-foot -RRB- rocket with a range of up to 300 km -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- depending on the variant , could be a valuable resource for any insurgent . Even without launching it , the warhead alone contains up to a tonne of high explosive , which could be stripped from the missile and used to make improvised bombs for urban guerrillas . `` The possibility is certainly there , '' said Shashank Joshi , a military expert at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute . `` Algeria has been terrified throughout this conflict of stocks like this , explosive devices , being taken out of Libya and used by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb . '' It is unlikely militants could steal the whole system and fire the missile . There was no sign at the site of any of the liquid fuel that propels the missile . This is stored separately because it is corrosive , and it has to be loaded into the missile before firing . `` It is not useful to a militant unless they have a source of liquid fuel nearby , '' said Joshi . Operating the missile also requires skilled technicians , he said , but it is theoretically possible that al Qaeda could find these . After the Red Army pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989 , mujahideen fighters -- some of whom later joined al Qaeda -- obtained stocks of Soviet Scuds and learned how to fire them . `` Clearly sometimes insurgent fighters can use Scud missiles , '' said Joshi . In an interview with Reuters on Friday , the senior European Union representative in Tripoli said the bloc was concerned that Islamist militants could obtain weapons in Libya and take them out across the country 's largely unpoliced borders . `` This is an evident risk , '' said EU envoy Agostino Miozzo . The NTC -- preoccupied with trying to catch Gaddafi , defeat his supporters in their remaining strongholds , and deal with shortages of fuel and water -- says securing the arms is a priority but not something that can be done straight away . `` Of course we are in a state of war , and Gaddafi definitely left some weapons and mines , '' General Omar Hariri , one of the interim government 's senior military commanders , told reporters in Tripoli last week . `` We have a group of military engineers who are specialized in finding out and digging out such weapons and such mines and it is only a matter of days before we are clearing all of these mines and gathering Gaddafi 's weapons , '' he said . `` We are still in a state of war so it 's very normal , it 's very natural . '' The Scud site is next to a highway leading east out of Tripoli and a short distance from a depot operated by U.S. oil services firm Schlumberger . It provided a glimpse of how Gaddafi 's forces had planned to use their military hardware for a last-ditch fight and then , when defeat became inevitable , hurriedly abandoned their posts . In total there were four mobile missile launchers parked within a radius of about 500 metres -LRB- yards -RRB- at the site . All the launchers had been covered to mask them from NATO warplanes -- they were draped in camouflage netting and parked under trees or sunk into trenches which local people said had been dug out by an excavator . Only one of the launchers had a missile mounted on it . It was not clear what had happened to the other rockets , though it appears they had not been used in the conflict . `` We do not know , '' said Abdelmounem Sabri , another colonel attached to the anti-Gaddafi military facility 15 km away . One of the launchers , without a missile on it , had been destroyed by a NATO air strike , leaving just a charred skeleton and scorching the eucalyptus tree it had been parked next to . Scattered in the sand around the launcher that was still loaded with a missile were about half a dozen anti-personnel mines , which appeared to have been dropped by the crew in their rush to leave . The canvas bags used to carry the mines were lying nearby . Colonel Derbek , giving a tour of the site , picked one of the mines up and nonchalantly waved it in the air . All of the intact Scud launchers seemed to be in working order . Dozens of cans of grease were thrown on the ground next to them , evidence that the crews had been keeping their mechanisms oiled and ready for action . At the armed launcher , the hydraulic control cables were plugged in to their sockets . The console that controls the stabilizer jacks on the launcher -- used to hold the unit steady for firing -- was attached by cables and sitting in the sand , ready to use . The crews had been living in a half-finished house a short distance away , most likely because they feared NATO strikes and did not want to camp right next to the Scud battery . At the house , there were more signs of a hasty departure . A traditional Arab water pipe was still primed with scented tobacco . On flimsy mattresses on the floor lay strewn razors , deodorant , toothbrushes and a pack of vitamin C tablets . Where the crews have gone , taking with them their expertise and , possibly , a grudge against Libya 's new rulers , is anyone 's guess . Five pairs of olive drab combat pants and six fatigue jackets lay at the site -- Gaddafi 's missile-men seemed to have changed into civilian clothes and melted into the population . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Guess where the high-bidders -LRB- financed by the Iranians -RRB- are coming from , and where the missile is going to wind up ? Yup , along the borders of Israel . Qaddafi was a better deal ... What evidence do you have to support those claims ? Baseless conjecture and denigrating an entire movement , began out of desire for freedom , is abhorrent . And your idea of a `` better '' deal is to allow a ruthless dictator to oppress and murder his people rather than stand for democracy , freedom , and other rights you so callously take for granted and even have the gall to say other human beings are not entitled too ? It is quite a poor reflection of yourself when you would choose for innocent human beings to be subjected to tyranny instead of building a functional state , that can prevent future arms smuggling and -- more importantly -- serve the interests of its people . The arrogance and near-savagery of your comment is astounding . Autocracy over democracy , really ? And the `` better deal '' is the gauge of your interests over the Libyan people , who would face the consequence and not you . To those who can not , or will not learn from the past . Why do we not learn from the Iraq stock piles of wepons left ungraded , or not destroyed , these are turned into IED 'S . This has happened through out history .

Ian Martin , in Libya to compile a report for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on rebuilding the country after its civil war , also said the interim government needed to start the electoral process soon if it is to honor its commitment to establish democracy . The disintegration of Muammar Gaddafi 's rule after a six-month war has left a security vacuum in Libya , with no state security forces , rebel fighters who are not part of any formal structure and huge quantities of unsecured weapons . `` Proliferation of weapons is a major concern , '' Martin told Reuters in an interview on the second day of a visit to the Libyan capital . `` It 's a concern to Libya 's neighbors , quite naturally . The European Union was working on border security issues here in the past and I think it has made clear that it 's willing to assist Libya in future if asked to do so . '' `` Clearly it 's a matter of moving from the current situation in which there are many people with weapons who are fighting in this conflict to one where there is a single public security force and the kind of proper state army that did n't exist in Libya in the past , '' he said . `` I 've just been discussing with the Minister of the Interior the challenge that they face in terms of public security , in terms of getting police more fully back on the streets and weapons off the streets and building a democratically accountable police force . '' '' -LRB- That is -RRB- not an easy matter in any society , let alone one which is just coming out of 42 years of oppressive security and conflict . '' The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , Libya 's de facto government since Gaddafi 's stronghold in the capital was overrun last month , says that it is in the process of integrating the armed rebel groups into the government . `` None of the groups is intent on staying as armed forces independent of the national army or the police and there is consensus on that , '' Aref El-Nayed , director of the NTC 's stabilization team , said earlier on Sunday . `` This process is already ongoing ... We are emerging with a unified structure . '' The NTC has committed itself to building a democratic system in Libya to replace Gaddafi 's authoritarian rule . It has set itself a timetable to establish a formal government and schedule elections . However , it has said that process will not get underway until `` national liberation '' -- without defining when or what that is . `` I think it is understandable that while there are still parts of the country that are not fully controlled by the new authorities , then they may not want to start the clock running on those commitments until they have the security throughout the country that would be necessary to carry them forward , '' said Martin . `` I do n't know exactly when that moment will be . '' `` The National Transitional Council has made strong commitments to proceed along a democratic path and has made clear it would like United Nations assistance in that area and although elections may be a little way ahead , that needs to begin soon to keep the commitment that they have made . '' He said there were no discussions with the new Libyan authorities about sending any kind of UN military or police force to help establish security . `` We 're not talking about a United Nations peacekeeping of any form here . We 're looking ahead to an essentially political , civilian mission with a number of advisory functions that could assist the authorities that they 've clearly identified . '' Martin said it was likely he would report on the situation in Libya to the UN Security Council at the end of next week . `` I certainly think that the commitments the leaders of the NTC are expressing to us are absolutely the right commitments . Of course they face a major challenge in implementing them in practice , and our commitment is to try to help them to do so , '' he said .

Reaching a remote oasis , she gave birth to a daughter and was gone again , deep into the desert in a caravan of luxury vehicles . So goes the story of Aisha Gaddafi as told by Algerians living in the oasis town of Djanet , 1,500 km -LRB- 900 miles -RRB- inland from Algiers . They said they saw little of the ousted Libyan leader 's family during their two-day stay last week , but would welcome other supporters of Gaddafi who arrived as refugees . Like their prime minister , who said on Sunday that Algeria took pride in welcoming such `` humanitarian cases , '' locals in Djanet , 60 km -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- from the Libyan frontier post of Ghat , said traditions of hospitality among desert nomads meant the fugitive women and their accompanying menfolk were sure of a welcome , whatever crimes Muammar Gaddafi himself is wanted for . `` She was well treated and received all the medical care she needed in the hospital , '' said shopkeeper Sahraoui Safi , one of several of the town 's few thousand residents to recount fleeting glimpses of the Libyan convoy , with some dozen family members aboard , moving between the hospital and a tightly-guarded villa . A man named Mohand , who runs a coffee shop near the clinic , said he saw a convoy of Libyan cars heading to the hospital on Monday : `` I think Algeria has done the right thing , offering help and support to a refugee , '' he said . `` She is a refugee . '' Algerian officials said Gaddafi 's second wife Safia , along with her daughter Aisha and son Hannibal , as well as Mohammed , a son of Gaddafi by his first wife , crossed the border on Monday , August 29 . That Aisha , an international lawyer in her mid-30s , was about to give birth was a critical factor in letting them in . The child , a girl , was born almost immediately , in the early hours of Tuesday , at the Efiri clinic , a simple medical facility on the outskirts of Djanet . Aisha and her new baby spent a second night in the town , at a secluded house , but then left . A source in Algeria who was aware of arrangements for the Gaddafis but was not authorised to discuss them , told Reuters the family was now staying discreetly in the empty southeast of the country , probably in Illizi province , a territory the size of Italy with a population of only 50,000 . `` Aisha is still in the area , '' the source said . `` I believe she is in Illizi province . '' The family will not find in the desert the sort of luxury lifestyle that has been revealed in the past fortnight in their abandoned homes in Tripoli . Djanet has little to tempt the traveler . With midday summer temperatures hitting 50 degrees Celsius -LRB- 120 Fahrenheit -RRB- in the shade , dusty chairs and tables stand in nearly empty cafes . Historically a watering stop for camel trains crossing Africa 's great desert , it is now a scattering of flat-roofed brown houses among palm groves that creep up the boulder-strewn slopes of a low hill on which French colonial legionnaires built a small strongpoint , Fort Charlet , a century ago . While there was no shortage of friction between Algiers and Tripoli during the four-decades of Gaddafi 's rule -- including a dispute over the border near Djanet -- the two countries share a post-colonial suspicion of Western power which fostered a certain solidarity between Gaddafi and Algeria 's ruling elite . `` Libya , a brother nation , is a nation with an ancestral history , a neighbouring people with whom we share a glorious past and a radiant future , '' Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said in defending giving shelter to the Gaddafis -- a move Libya 's new rulers called an act of aggression . The government has ruled out taking in Gaddafi himself . Gaddafi 's whereabouts are not known , but one of his remaining bastions of support in Libya is Sabha , a 500 km -LRB- 300 mile -RRB- drive across the desert from Djanet . Algerian officials said Gaddafi called them and said he was in Ghadames , close to the border further north . Hundreds of Libyans from Sabha and as from as far away as Tripoli have come to Djanet and other villages in Illizi , residents said , adding that many were supporters of Gaddafi . They are keeping a low profile . When a Reuters reporter approached a group of people residents identified as visitors from Libya , they declined to speak . Algerians say they are trying to accommodate the incomers as best they can , despite their own limited means . The shopkeeper , Safi , said he had hosted a man he described as a cousin of Gaddafi in his home and sympathised with the plight of those fleeing their homeland . `` Some Libyans have lost everything overnight , it is a tragedy for most of them , '' he said . `` They never thought they would one day be refugees . '' Algeria has now closed the southern part of its border with Libya , according to a security source at the Debdeb crossing , near Ghadames . The source said hundreds of Libyans entered Algeria in the days before the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council put up its red , green and black flag on the Libyan frontier post . `` Now that the NTC controls the border , it is difficult for Gaddafi and his aides to get to Algeria , '' the source said . Algeria is the only one of Libya 's North African neighbors yet to recognize the NTC as Libya 's new authorities . It says it will do so once there is a representative government . Algerian officials say they are particularly concerned that Islamist militants have infiltrated the NTC and that al Qaeda 's North African wing will exploit the chaos in Libya to acquire weapons and explosives . However , many Algerians have criticised the government for failing to embrace the anti-Gaddafi movement in Libya . Algerians have followed the conflict closely , and many share the view of others in the Arab world that Gaddafi was a despot . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The leader Aisha saw the death of his daughter Mastura , her brother Saif el Arab Gaddafi on the NATO bombing -LRB- 01-05-2011 -RRB- , his husband and love of her life Abu Ahmed Meniar and other compatriots . We admire their courage . Aisha is the leader of the Resistance , HOPE of the Libyan people . Aisha is an Arab woman , dignified , professional , highly qualified and fighter , great personality , Ambassador of Peace by the United Nations and consistent with Arab culture , participated in the defense of Hussein , whom was never proven that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction . The invasion of Iraq was also a slander to seize the oil wells . NATO members are oppressing the Libyan people FORCED into profitable contracts for transnational corporations of West . This theft of natural resources has had a high cost greater than the 50000 deaths Libyans . Having great strength and keeping her family together in this time of great suffering , AISHA Gaddafi . You are the hope of the Libyan people . Do n't give up on Ghaddafi yet . He is a survivor . Many British politicians like Galloway have exposed the lies and deception of NATO . The war continues while media blackout has been introduced . Have you noticed the lack of direct media reports from Lybia since the end of August ? They want you to believe that all is fine while Lybia descends into civil war . Ghaddafi is smart by opting for guerilla warfare . When NATO pulls back he will be ready to return .

In an early sign of divisions among the victors in Libya 's six-month civil war , Ismail al-Salabi also took a swipe at secular groups he said were trying to give Islamists a bad name and create political strife that would only benefit Gaddafi . Salabi leads the February 17 brigade which many Libyans credit with the successful last-ditch defense of Benghazi , where the uprising began on that date . Only later did NATO air power tip the balance in favor of the largely untrained rebel forces . `` The role of the executive committee is no longer required because they are remnants of the old regime . They should all resign , starting from the head of the pyramid all the way down , '' Salabi told Reuters in the eastern city . He was referring to the National Transitional Council 's de facto cabinet , which is headed by Mahmoud Jibril , who once headed Libya 's state economic think-tank under Gaddafi . The 40-member NTC is a disparate mix of former officials in the Gaddafi administration , businessmen , academics , lawyers and exiles . Salabi commands at least 3,000 fighters and reports to the interim interior ministry in Tripoli , according to an NTC spokesman . He accompanied NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil to a NATO meeting in Doha last month and said he fully supports him . Abdel Jalil resigned as Gaddafi 's justice minister after violence was used against the protests that erupted on February 17 . Salabi once fought in Afghanistan but denies any links to Islamist groups outside Libya , such as the Taliban and al Qaeda . After the anti-Gaddafi revolt , his forces received arms from the Gulf Arab state of Qatar . Without naming anyone , Salabi criticised those he said were trying to cast Libyan Islamist leaders as extremists . `` There are secularists who have their own private agenda and would like to portray us as extremist to alienate us from the international community and cause the division that will only serve the tyrant , '' he said , referring to Gaddafi . `` Sometimes you wonder and ask , who are they serving ? '' Salabi said he planned to send a memo to the NTC and its foreign allies to warn them to ensure that Libyan assets abroad , frozen to punish Gaddafi and now being released to the NTC , do not come back under control of the same officials who once handled them for Gaddafi . `` Lately , the -LRB- NTC -RRB- executive committee has done nothing but talk about unfreezing the assets , '' he said . `` These were in the names of individuals in the old regime , so if you unfreeze the assets you unfreeze them in their favor . They belong to the Libyan people . '' Big powers agreed in Paris last week to unfreeze $ 15 billion in Libyan assets once controlled by Gaddafi or his aides . Libya 's total foreign assets are estimated at some $ 170 billion . The influx of money will test the capacity and intentions of Libya 's new leaders , who are trying to restore order and public services in an oil-rich country with a glut of guns and forge a new brand of democratic politics after 42 years of one-man rule . `` We are asking the international community and NTC to be very , very careful , '' said Salabi , a former businessman who spent time in jail in the Gaddafi era . A senior NTC member said the unfrozen funds would be spent on education , security and medical care for landmine victims . Salabi said his fighters , hardened by six months of combat with Gaddafi 's forces , would join any battle for the coastal city of Sirte , voicing scepticism that it would surrender . But he said the February 17 brigade would respect deadlines set by the NTC , which has given more time for talks on a peaceful handover of the city that sits on an east-west coastal highway . `` With our in-depth knowledge of the hierarchy of the commanders of the forces at Sirte , we feel that unfortunately force will be the only means , '' he said . `` I do not believe that the tribal elders will carry weight with that leadership . '' Salabi said capturing southern towns still held by Gaddafi forces in Libya 's vast desert hinterland and securing the borders with Chad and Niger were formidable tasks . `` We still have Sabha and then Jufra , '' he said of areas in the Sahara still not under the control of the new authorities . `` We have to then comb this massive area between Sirte , Sabha and Jufra . That will be very difficult as it 's quite extensive .

Abdel Majid Mlegta ran the companies that supplied meals to Libyan government departments including the interior ministry . The job was `` easy , '' he told Reuters last week . `` I built good relations with officers . I wanted to serve my country . '' But in the first few weeks of the uprising , he secretly began to work for the rebels . He recruited sympathizers at the nerve center of the Gaddafi government , pinpointed its weak links and its command-and-control strength in Tripoli , and passed that information onto the rebel leadership on a series of flash memory cards . The first was handed to him , he says , by Gaddafi military intelligence and security officers . It contained information about seven key operations rooms in the capital , including internal security , the Gaddafi revolutionary committees , the popular guards -- as Gaddafi 's voluntary armed militia was known -- and military intelligence . The data included names of the commanders of those units , how many people worked in each center and how they worked , as well as crucial details like the number plates of their cars , and how each unit communicated with the central command led by intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi and Gaddafi 's second son Saif al-Islam . That memory card -- which Mlegta later handed to officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -LRB- NATO -RRB- -- provided the basis of a sophisticated plan to topple the Libyan dictator and seize Tripoli . The operation , which took months of planning , involved secretly arming rebel units inside the capital . Those units would help NATO destroy strategic targets in the city -- operation rooms , safe houses , military barracks , police stations , armored cars , radars and telephone centers . At an agreed time , the units would then rise up as rebels attacked from all sides . The rebels called the plan Operation Dawn Mermaid . This is the inside story -- much of it never before told -- of how that plan unfolded . The rebels were not alone . British operatives infiltrated Tripoli and planted radio equipment to help target air strikes and avoid killing civilians , according to U.S. and allied sources . The French supplied training and transport for new weapons . Washington helped at a critical late point by adding two extra Predator drones to the skies over Tripoli , improving NATO 's ability to strike . Also vital , say western and rebel officials , was the covert support of Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar . Doha gave weapons , military training and money to the rebels . By the time the rebels were ready for the final assault , they were so confident of success that they openly named the date and time of the attack : Saturday , August 20 , at 8 p.m. , just after most people in Tripoli broke their Ramadan fast . `` We did n't make it a secret , '' said Mohammed Gula , who led a pro-rebel political cell in central Tripoli and spoke to Reuters as rebels first entered Gaddafi 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound . `` We said it out on the street . People did n't believe us . They believe us now . '' Planning began in April , two months into the uprising . Rebel leader Mahmoud Jibril and three other senior insurgents met in the Tunisian city of Djerba , according to both Mlegta and another senior official from the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , as the alternative rebel government calls itself . The three were Mlegta , who by then had fled Tripoli and joined the rebels as the head of a brigade ; Ahmed Mustafa al-Majbary , who was head of logistics and supplies ; and Othman Abdel-Jalil , a scientist who became coordinator of the Tripoli plan . Before he fled , Mlegta had spent just under two months working inside the regime , building up a network of sympathizers . At first , 14 of Gaddafi 's officers were prepared to help . By the end there were 72 , Mlegta says . `` We used to meet at my house and sometimes at the houses of two other officers ... We preserved the secrecy of our work and it was in coordination with the NTC executive committee . '' Brigadier General Abdulsalam Alhasi , commander of the rebels ' main operation center in Benghazi , said those secretly helping the rebels were `` police , security , military , even some people from the cabinet ; many , many people . They gave us information and gave instructions to the people working with them , somehow to support the revolution . '' One of those was al-Barani Ashkal , commander-in-chief of the guard at Gaddafi 's military compound in the suburbs of Tripoli . Like many , Ashkal wanted to defect , but was asked by the NTC to remain in his post where , Alhasi says , he would become instrumental in helping the rebels enter the city . The rebel planning committee -- another four men would join later , making seven in all -- knew that the targets on the memory sticks were the key to crippling Gaddafi 's forces . The men included Hisham abu Hajar , chief commander of the Tripoli Brigade , Usama Abu Ras , who liaised with some cells inside Tripoli , and Rashed Suwan , who helped financially and coordinated with the tribes of Tripoli to ease the rebels ' entry . According to Mlegta and to Hisham Buhagiar , a rebel colonel and the committee 's seventh member , the group initially drew up a list of 120 sites for NATO to target in the days leading up to their attack . Rebel leaders discussed their idea with French President Nicolas Sarkozy at a meeting at the Elysee Palace on April 20 . That meeting was one of five in Paris in April and May , according to Mlegta . Most were attended by the chiefs of staff of NATO countries involved in the bombing campaign , which had begun in March , as well as military officials from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . After presenting the rebels ' plan `` from A to Z '' , Mlegta handed NATO officials three memory cards : the one packed with information about regime strongholds in Tripoli ; another with updated information on regime sites as well as details of 65 Gaddafi officers sympathetic to the rebels who had been secretly supplied with NATO radiophones ; and a third which contained the plot to take Tripoli . Sarkozy expressed enthusiasm for the plan , according to Mlegta and the senior NTC official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . The leaders slimmed the 120 targets down to 82 and `` assigned 2,000 armed men to go into Tripoli and 6,000 unarmed to go out -LRB- onto the streets -RRB- in the uprising , '' according to rebel colonel Buhagiar . He joined the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya in 1981 and has lived in the United States and trained as a special forces operative in both Sudan and Iraq . There were already anti-Gaddafi cells in the capital that the rebels knew they could activate . `` The problem was that we needed time , '' the senior NTC official said . `` We feared that some units may go out into the streets in a spontaneous way and they would be quashed . We also needed time to smuggle weapons , fighters and boats . '' In the early months of the uprising , pro-rebel fighters had slipped out of Tripoli and made their way to the north-western city of Misrata , where they were trained for the uprising , rebels in Misrata told Reuters in June . The leaders of two rebel units said `` hundreds '' of Tripoli residents had begun slipping back into the city by mid-July . Commander Alhasi and other rebel officers in Benghazi said the number of infiltrators sent into Tripoli was dozens , not hundreds . `` This was not D-Day , '' Alhasi told Reuters in his office . Most of the infiltrators traveled to Tripoli by fishing trawler , according to Alhasi . They were equipped with light weapons -- rifles and sub-machineguns -- hand grenades , demolition charges and radios . `` We could call them and they could call each other , '' Alhasi said . `` Most of them were volunteers , from all parts of Libya , and Libyans from overseas . Everybody wants to do something for the success of the revolution . '' Although Tripoli was ostensibly under the control of Gaddafi loyalists , rebels said the security system was porous : bribery or other ruses could be used to get in and out . Small groups of men also began probing the government 's security system with nighttime attacks on checkpoints , according to one operative who talked to Reuters in June . It was possible to smuggle weapons into Tripoli , but it was easier and less risky -- if far more expensive -- to buy them from Gaddafi loyalists looking to make a profit before the regime collapsed . The going rate for a Kalashnikov in Tripoli was $ 5,000 over the summer ; in Misrata the same weapon cost $ 3,000 . Morale got a boost when rebels broke into government communication channels and recorded 2,000 calls between the regime 's top leadership , including a few with Gaddafi 's sons , on everything from military orders to sex . The NTC mined the taped calls for information and broadcast some of them on rebel TV , a move that frightened the regime , according to the senior NTC source . `` They knew then that we had infiltrated and broken into their ranks . '' Recordings of two of the calls were also handed to the International Criminal Court . One featured Gaddafi 's prime minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi threatening to burn the family of Abdel Rahman Shalgham , a one-time Libyan ambassador to the United Nations and an early defector to the rebels . Al-Mahmoudi described Shalgham as a slave . The other was between al-Mahmoudi and Tayeb al-Safi , minister of economy and trade ; the pair joked about how the Gaddafi brigades would rape the women of Zawiyah when they entered the town . Several allied and U.S. officials , as well as a source close to the Libyan rebels , said that around the beginning of May , foreign military trainers including British , French and Italian operatives , as well as representatives from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , began to organize serious efforts to hone the rebels into a more effective fighting force . Most of the training happened in the rebel-held Western Mountains . But Eric Denece , a former French intelligence operative and now Director of the French Center for Research on Intelligence , says an elite rebel force of fighters from the east was trained both inside and outside Libya , at NATO bases and those of other allies . This `` overseas brigade '' was then dropped back into the country . In all , estimated Denece , some 100-200 foreign operatives were sent to Libya , where they focused on training and military coordination . Mlegta confirms that number . Rebel commander Alhasi insists western special forces were not involved in combat ; the main help they gave was with the bombing campaign and training . London , Paris and Washington also say their troops were not involved in combat . `` They complied with our -LRB- bombing -RRB- requirements , immediately sometimes , sometimes we had a delay , '' said Alhasi , who has a big satellite photograph of Tripoli on one of his walls . `` We had the information on the ground about the targets and relayed it to them . '' A European official knowledgeable about such operations said `` dozens '' of plain-clothes French military advisers were sent to Libya . A French official said between 30 and 40 `` military advisers '' helped organize the rebels and trained them on basic weapons and more high-tech hardware . In May , the French began smuggling weapons into western Libya . French military spokesmen later confirmed these arms drops , saying they were justified as `` humanitarian support '' , but also briefing that the aim was to prepare for an advance on Tripoli . British undercover personnel carried out some of the most important on-the-ground missions by allied forces before the fall of Tripoli , U.S. and allied officials told Reuters . One of their key tasks , according to allied officials , was planting radio equipment to help allied forces target Gaddafi 's military forces and command-and-control centers . This involved dangerous missions to infiltrate the capital , locate specific potential targets and then plant equipment so bomber planes could precisely target munitions , destroying sensitive targets without killing bystanders . In mid-March , a month after violent resistance to Gaddafi 's rule first erupted , President Obama had signed a sweeping top secret order , known as a covert operations `` finding '' , which gave broad authorization to the CIA to support the rebels . But while the general authorization encompassed a wide variety of possible measures , the presidential finding required the CIA to come back to the White House for specific permissions to move ahead and help them . Several U.S. officials said that , because of concerns about the rebels ' disorganization , internal politics , and limited paramilitary capabilities , clandestine U.S. support on the ground never went much beyond intelligence collection . U.S. officials acknowledge that as rebel forces closed in on Tripoli , such intelligence `` collection '' efforts by the CIA and other American agencies in Libya became very extensive and included efforts to help the rebels and other NATO allies track down Gaddafi and his entourage . But the Obama administration 's intention , the officials indicated , was that if any such intelligence fell into American hands it would be passed onto others . A senior U.S. defense official disclosed to Reuters details of a legal opinion showing the Pentagon would not be able to supply lethal aid to the rebels -- even with the U.S. recognition of the NTC . `` It was a legal judgment that the quasi-recognition that we gave to the NTC as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people did n't check the legal box to authorize us to be providing lethal assistance under the Arms Export Control Act , '' the senior official said . In some ways the rebels ' most unlikely ally was Qatar . The Gulf Arab state is keen to downplay its role , perhaps understandably given that it is ruled by an absolute monarch . But on the ground , signs abounded of the emirate 's support . The weapons and equipment the French brought in were mostly supplied by Qatar , according to rebel sources . In May , a Reuters reporter saw equipment in boxes clearly stamped `` Qatar . '' It included mortar kits , military fatigues , radios and binoculars . At another location , Reuters saw new anti-tank missiles . Qatar 's decision to supply arms to the rebellion , one source close to the NTC told Reuters , was instigated by influential Libyan Islamist scholar Ali Salabi , who sought refuge in Qatar after fleeing Libya in the late 1990s . He had previously worked with Gaddafi 's son Saif , to help rehabilitate Libyans who had fought in Afghanistan . Salabi 's brother Ismael is also a leader of a rebel militia in Libya . Salabi `` is the link to the influential figures in Qatar , and convinced the Qataris to get involved , '' said the source close to the NTC . By early June , Libya seemed locked in a stalemate . After three months of civil war , rebels had seized huge swathes of territory , but NATO bombing had failed to dislodge Gaddafi . The African Union said the only way forward was a ceasefire and negotiated peace . London joined Paris in suggesting that while Gaddafi must step down , perhaps he could stay in Libya . But hidden away from view , the plan to seize Tripoli was moving into action . The rebels began making swift advances in the Western Mountains , out of Misrata and around the town of Zintan . Newly arrived Apache attack helicopters operating from Britain 's HMS Ocean , an amphibious assault ship , were destroying armored vehicles . NATO aircraft dropped leaflets to dispirit Gaddafi forces and improve rebel morale . `` The game-changer has been the attack helicopters which have given the NTC more protection from Gaddafi 's heavy weapons , '' a French Defense Ministry official said . The rebels ' foreign backers were eager to hasten the war . For one thing , a U. N. mandate for bombing ran only to the end of September ; agreement on an extension was not guaranteed . One U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters the main U.S. concern was `` breaking the rough stalemate before the end of the NATO mandate '' . The Europeans were also burning through costly munitions and Washington was concerned about wear and tear on NATO allies ' aircraft . `` Some of the countries ... basically every deployable F-16 they had in the inventory was deployed , '' a senior U.S. defense official told Reuters . But the momentum was shifting in the rebels ' favor . On July 28 , the assassination of rebel military commander Abdel Fatah Younes proved a surprise turning-point . The former Interior Minister had defected to the rebels in February . Some believe he had held back their advance from the east , for reasons that remain unclear . Younes ' death at the hands of his own men raised questions about the NTC and added impetus to NATO 's desire to push things along in case the anti-Gaddafi forces imploded . The West forced NTC head Mahmoud Jibril to change his cabinet . NATO then took more of the lead in preparations , according to Denece , who said he has contacts within both French and Libyan intelligence . There was another boon to the rebels . Regional heavyweight Turkey came out in support of the NTC in July , and then held a conference at which 30 countries backed them . `` The Turks actually were very helpful throughout this in a very quiet kind of way , '' said the senior U.S. defense official . With the morale of Gaddafi troops eroding , the end was clearly near . Mediocre at the best of times , Gaddafi 's fighters began fading away . So too did his secret weapon : foreign mercenaries . After the uprising began , Gaddafi recruited several thousand mercenaries ; some formed the core of his best-organised forces . Most of the hired guns came from countries to Libya 's south such as Chad , Mali , and Niger , but some were from further afield , including South Africa and the Balkans . Among them was a former Bosnian Serb fighter who had fought in Sierra Leone as a mercenary and later worked as a contractor in Afghanistan and Iraq . Hired in March , first as an instructor and later as the commander of a 120mm mortar battery , the fighter , who used his nom-de-guerre Crni -LRB- `` the Black '' in Serbian -RRB- , told Reuters he had been paid regularly in cash in the western currency of his choice . `` I knew Libyans had poor discipline , but what I have seen was dismal in comparison with what we had in former Yugoslavia during our wars , '' he told Reuters . `` They were cowards , at least many of them . Communications were the biggest problem , as they just could n't figure out how to operate anything more sophisticated than a walkie-talkie , so we resorted to cellphones , when they worked and while they worked . '' It was in early August , he said , that `` everything started falling apart . '' The force of which he was a part began retreating from a rebel onslaught . `` At some point we came under fire from a very organised group , and I suspect they were infiltrated -LRB- by -RRB- NATO ground troops , '' he said . The loyalist units pulled back to a point about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . By mid-August , `` I decided it was enough . I took a jeep with plenty of fuel and water and another two Libyans I trusted , and we traveled across the desert to a neighboring country . It took us four days to get there . '' Foreign agents , meanwhile , were circulating far and wide . At the Tunisia-Libya border in early August , a Reuters reporter ran into a Libyan with an American accent who identified himself as the head of the rebel command center in the Western Mountains . He was accompanied by two muscular blond western men . He said he spent a lot of time in the United States and Canada , but would not elaborate . As the rebels advanced on Zawiyah , the Reuters reporter also saw western-looking men inside the Western Mountain region traveling in simple , old pickup trucks . Not far away , rebels in Nalut said they were being aided by CIA agents , though this was impossible to verify . Operation Dawn Mermaid was initially meant to begin on August 10 , according to Mohammed Gula , the political cell leader in central Tripoli . But `` other cities were not yet ready '' , the leadership decided , and it was put off for a few days . A debate flared inside the Pentagon about whether to send extra Predator drones to Libya . `` It was a controversial issue even as to whether it made sense to pull -LRB- drones -RRB- from other places to boost this up to try to bring this to a quicker conclusion , '' the U.S. defense official said . Those who backed the use of extra drones won , and the last two Predators were taken from a training base in the United States and sent to north Africa , arriving on August 16 . In the meantime , the rebels had captured several cities . By August 17 or 18 , recalls Gula , `` when we heard that Zawiyah had fallen , and Zlitan looked like it was about to fall , and Garyan had fallen , we decided now is the time . '' Those successes had a knock-on effect , U.S. and NATO officials told Reuters . With much of the country now conquered , Predator drones and other surveillance and strike planes could finally be focused on the capital . Data released by the Pentagon showed a substantial increase in the pace of U.S. air strikes in Libya between August 10 and August 22 . `` We did n't have to scan the entire country any longer , '' a NATO official said . `` We were able to focus on where the concentrations of regime forces were . '' Days before the attack on Tripoli , the White House began leaking stories to TV networks saying Gaddafi was near the end . But U.S. intelligence officials -- who are supposed to give an objective view of the situation on the ground -- were pushing back , telling journalists they were not so sure of immediate victory and the fighting could go on for months . Then , on August 19 , a breakthrough : Abdel Salam Jalloud , one of the most public faces of Gaddafi 's regime , defected . Jalloud had been trying to get out for the previous three months , according to the senior NTC official . `` He asked for our help but because he wanted his whole family , not only his immediate one , to flee with him it was a logistical problem . His whole family was around 35 . '' By now , the mountain roads were under rebel control . They took him and his family from Tripoli to Zintan and across the border into Tunisia . From there , he flew to Italy and on to Qatar . The rebel leadership was ready . But now NATO wanted more time . `` Once they got control of Zawiyah , we were sort of expecting that they would make a strategic pause , regroup and then make the push on into Tripoli , '' the senior U.S. defense official said . `` We told NATO we 're going to go anyway , '' said a senior NTC official . The western alliance quickly scaled back its number of bombing targets to 32 from 82 , while rebel special forces hit some of the control rooms that were not visible , like those in schools and hospitals . The signal to attack came soon after sunset on August 20 , in a speech by NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil . `` The noose is tightening , '' he said . A `` veritable bloodbath '' was about to occur . Within 10 minutes of his speech , rebel cells in neighborhoods across Tripoli started moving . Some units were directly linked to the operation ; many others were not but had learned about the plan . `` We did n't choose it , the circumstances and the operations led us to this date , '' Alhasi told Reuters when asked why the uprising in Tripoli began then . `` There was a public plan in Tripoli that they would rise up on that day , by calling from the mosques . It was not a military plan , not an official plan , it was a people 's plan . The people inside Tripoli , they did this in coordination with us . '' In the first few hours , rebel cells attacked installations and command posts . Others simply secured neighborhoods , setting up roadblocks and impeding movement . Ships laden with food and ammunition set off from rebel-held Misrata . Rebel forces began pushing toward the capital from the Western Mountains and from the east . According to French newspapers , NATO cleared a path on the water by destroying pro-Gaddafi speed boats equipped with explosives . The first rebel soldiers reached the city within a few hours . The rag-tag army did n't look like much : some warriors wore football kit bearing the name of English soccer players . But they encountered little resistance . One rebel source said Gaddafi had made a fatal error by sending his important brigades and military leaders , including his son Mu'atassem , to secure the oil town of Brega . The Libyan leader apparently feared the loss of the oil area would empower the rebels . But it meant he left Tripoli without strong defences , allowing the rebels easy entry . The air war was also overwhelming the regime . Under attack , Gaddafi forces brought whatever heavy equipment they still had out of hiding . In the final 24 hours , a western military official said , NATO `` could see remnants of Gaddafi forces trying to reconstitute weapons systems , specifically surface-to-air missiles '' . NATO pounded with them with air strikes . By Sunday August 21 , the rebels controlled large parts of Tripoli . In the confusion , the NTC announced it had captured Saif al-Islam . Late the following evening , though , he turned up at the Rixos , the Tripoli hotel where foreign reporters were staying . `` I am here to disperse the rumors ... , '' he declared . U.S. and European officials now say they believe Saif was never in custody . NTC chief Mahmoud Jibril attributes the fiasco to conflicting reports within the rebel forces . But , he says , the bumbling turned into a bonanza : `` The news of his arrest gave us political gains . Some countries recognized us , some brigades surrendered ... and more than 30 officers defected . '' As the Gaddafi brigades collapsed , the rebels reached a sympathizer in the Libyan military who patched them into the radio communications of Gaddafi 's forces . `` We could hear the panic through their orders , '' said the senior NTC official . `` That was the first indication that our youths were in control of Tripoli . '' As the hunt for Gaddafi got underway , the NTC began implementing a 70-page plan , drawn up in consultation with its foreign military backers , aimed at establishing security in the capital . Officials in London , Paris and Washington are at pains to say the plan is not based on the experience of Iraq or any other country , but the lessons of their mistakes in Baghdad are obvious . At a press conference in Qatar , NTC head Jibril said Libya would `` rehabilitate and cure our wounds by being united so we can rebuild the nation . '' Unity was not hard to find during the uprising . `` The most important factor was the will of the people , '' commander Alhasi told Reuters . `` The people hate Gaddafi .

Less than a month before the start of the revolt , the British arm of U.S.-based General Dynamics was making arrangements to improve communications systems for tanks , artillery and armored troop carriers for the Khamis Brigade , which played a lead role in cracking down on the revolt , according to documents found by Reuters at a brigade base . General Dynamics said the upgrade was never completed . But the documents illustrate in detail for the first time what weapons were involved in the deal and that the firm was doing business with Gaddafi 's forces on the eve of the uprising . It said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary 's May 2008 contract with Libya -- an 85 million pound -LRB- $ 136 million -RRB- deal to provide a tactical communications and data system as part of what it termed at the time `` the United Kingdom 's initiatives to improve economic , educational and defense links with Libya . '' This was after Gaddafi , widely ostracized abroad for much of his 42-year rule because the West accused him of supporting terrorism , abandoned his program of mass-destruction weapons in 2003 , returning Libya to mainstream international politics . The Khamis Brigade , led by and named after one of Gaddafi 's sons , was the best equipped of Libya 's security forces and was directly involved in putting down the uprising in cities such as Misrata and Tripoli , where thousands of people were killed . Peter Bouckaert , emergencies director with Human Rights Watch , said the brigades commanded by Khamis , and another Gaddafi son , Mutassim , were able to become so strong thanks in part to procurement from Western countries . `` These elite brigades ... had access to the most modern weapons , '' he said . `` We 've documented arms sales from not just the usual suspects but also Western companies . `` I think the lesson is that if you 're going to sell weapons to dictators , at some point down the line you 're going to be deeply embarrassed . '' A letter from a General Dynamics UK project manager , Simon Kirkham , to Libya 's defense ministry dated January 25 was found this week in the Khamis Brigade 's bullet-scarred compound near Tripoli . That date marked the start of anti-government protests in Egypt , to Libya 's east . Libya 's neighbor to the west , Tunisia , had already toppled its president and political analysts were predicting similar protests could erupt against Gaddafi . The note , and an Arabic document accompanying it , listed 40 T-72 tanks , eight Palmaria artillery pieces , four BTR-60 armored personnel carriers , 10 Shilka anti-aircraft systems and two M-113 armored personnel carriers to be upgraded . `` These platforms are required to meet the proposed 1 April conversion deadline , '' said the letter , which listed offices in England and Wales . A spokesman for General Dynamics , Rob Doolittle , said he could not comment specifically on the documents without seeing them , but said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary 's May 2008 contract with Libya . That deal came as `` part of the United Kingdom 's initiatives to improve economic , educational and defense links with Libya , '' a statement released at the time said . `` It will provide communications and data handling capabilities , together with technical and training support , to the Elite Brigade of Libya 's armed forces , '' the release said . Doolittle said the firm did not finish deploying the system , involving a process sometimes referred to as `` conversion '' -- switching from one communications system to another -- and did not train Libyan forces in its use . A small group of General Dynamics UK employees working on the system were withdrawn from Libya in early February , he added . Inside the Khamis Brigade compound , a narrow road cuts through rows of planted cypress trees which shield the central area from view . The burned-out husks of tanks and ammunition crates lay tucked between the trees . Human rights activists and analysts say the Khamis unit played a major role in the civil war , spearheading the fight against NATO-backed rebels who took up arms after a crackdown on anti-government protesters in February . A leaked 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable said the brigade `` effectively serves as a regime protection unit . '' Libyans knew the brigade for its discipline and fierce loyalty to Gaddafi . `` This was a place of torture , a place of imprisonment , a place of mercenaries and a place of terrorism , '' Abdel Hafidth Iswad , a former rebel now helping guard the compound , said . The General Dynamics UK deal to provide communications technology to the unit came the year after former Prime Minister Tony Blair 's 2007 visit to Libya , a seminal moment in the push to warmer relations between Gaddafi and the West . For years , Gaddafi had been shunned for his government 's alleged role in bombings and other attacks in Britain and elsewhere , and was accused by human rights activists of brutal repression of dissent at home . The documents obtained by Reuters showed the General Dynamics UK work was scheduled up to and through the date the revolt broke out , with start dates between February 10 and February 24 , and end dates between February 24 and March 17 . Separate documents found by Human Rights Watch in the unit 's compound , overrun by anti-Gaddafi fighters last month and now open to journalists , showed the brigade was receiving arms from a variety of countries and companies . One 2004 order marked the delivery of Russian-made Kalashnikov rifles , and one from 2009 showed an unspecified delivery was made from South Africa . Another 2009 order showed rifles came from Belgium 's FN Herstal . Boxes of those FN rifles now litter the compound , including the archives room where many of the documents related to the daily functioning , tactical planning and weapons procurement of the base were found . `` Is anyone surprised these weapons were used against his -LRB- Gaddafi 's -RRB- own people ? '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . If it 's based in America it is American , so what if they have a section in the UK ? So you see , the US government has no problem with American companies providing weapons and technology to unpopular undemocratic regimes . Corporations rule American policy . Kind of interesting , but no big surprise , we are n't the most moral country . Hey -- Our government tortures ! You can not expect much from the good old USA anymore . Why would they be embarrassed ? I 'm sure it was a very lucrative deal for them . Kind of like Halliburton 's current drilling operations in Iran . Or Reagan 's arms deals to the Mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan -LRB- early Al Qaeda brigades -RRB- . You ca n't embarrass these people .

Full Article Gaddafi tracked heading south - Libyan official BENGHAZI , Libya\\/AGADEZ , Niger | Wed Sep 7 , 2011 6:30 pm IST BENGHAZI , Libya\\/AGADEZ , Niger -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi was last tracked heading for Libya 's southern border , the man leading the hunt told Reuters , though Burkina Faso again denied on Wednesday any plan to offer the deposed leader refuge . After the arrival in neighbouring Niger of dozens of Libyan vehicles , including some which may be carrying gold and cash , the United States said the convoy included aides to Gaddafi and urged authorities in Niger to hold any war crimes suspects . Niger has denied Gaddafi is in the poor , landlocked former French colony . But a French military source has told Reuters that he and his son Saif al-Islam may have planned to rendezvous with the convoy in the Sahara , possibly via Algeria , before heading for Burkina Faso , which in the past had offered refuge . Hisham Buhagiar , who coordinates efforts by Libya 's interim government to find the ousted strongman , said he had evidence he may have been near the southern village of Ghwat , some 300 km -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- north of the border with Niger , three days ago . `` The last tracks , he was in the Ghwat area . People saw the cars going in that direction , '' Buhagiar said in an interview late on Tuesday . `` We have it from many sources that he 's trying to go further south , towards Chad or Niger . '' Burkina President Blaise Compaore denied discussing giving Gaddafi sanctuary . `` We have no information regarding the presence of Libyans on our soil since these events , and we have had no contacts with anyone in Libya about a request for political asylum , '' he told reporters in the capital Ouagadougou . Compaore has ruled for 24 years after taking power , like Gaddafi , in a military coup . And like other African states , Burkina benefited from oil-funded Libyan aid under Gaddafi . Niger has also tried to distance itself . Officials have confirmed that Gaddafi 's security chief Mansour Dhao had been let in but insisted it was a humanitarian gesture . Its interior minister denied on Tuesday a report from Niger and French military sources that 200-250 Libyan army vehicles had arrived via Algeria on Monday near the northern town of Agadez . As with all efforts so far to find Gaddafi , two full weeks after his Tripoli headquarters were overrun by the motley collection of rebel groups who rose up in February , the trail is hazy , in a region where people are few and far between . Buhagiar also said : `` He 's out of Bani Walid , I think . '' He was referring to the besieged tribal bastion , 150 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , where fighters of the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- have been trying to negotiate the surrender of a hard core of Gaddafi loyalists . NTC commanders said last week they thought Gaddafi , 69 , was there planning a counter-strike with Saif al-Islam , his heir apparent , and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi . But it appears the senior figures are not there now , officials say . All three are wanted by the International Criminal Court at The Hague for war crimes committed during the revolt -- though Libyans say they want to try them first , including for atrocities over the four decades before this year 's uprising . U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he was unsure whether , as U.S. officials have said , Gaddafi was still in Libya : `` I think he 's been taking a lot of steps to make sure that in the end he could try to get out if he had to , but as to where , when , and how that 'll take place , we just do n't know . '' Gaddafi 's fugitive spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , insisted in a call to Reuters on Tuesday that he had not left . `` He is in Libya . He is safe , he is very healthy , in high morale . '' NTC commanders have said this week they believe Ibrahim may be in Bani Walid , where a tense standoff continued . Outside the town on Wednesday , residents leaving through a sun-scorched NTC checkpoint set up around the nearby settlement of Wishtata painted an increasingly desperate picture inside Bani Walid . `` People are terrorised . There is no one in the streets , '' said Salah Ali , 39 . `` But many still support Gaddafi because they were paid by the regime , because many have committed crimes and are afraid of arrest . '' Inside Bani Walid , tucked away in a valley in barren hills south of the capital , residents said Gaddafi-era green flags still wave above houses and a portrait of the `` Brother Leader '' in military uniform towers above its central square . Shooting in the air and shouting insults from the back of their pick-up trucks , groups of Gaddafi loyalists regularly speed through its streets , residents said . They often shout `` Allah , Muammar , Libya , nothing else ! '' -- the principal slogan of the old regime , especially during this year 's civil war . `` I went to see my family there yesterday , '' said Imad Mohammed Ali , a 21-year-old supporter of the new leadership . `` There is no electricity , no cooking gas , no communications . There is n't enough food . People are using coal to make fire . There is no medicine . There are no people in the streets . '' Aid agencies have also raised concerns about conditions for civilians in the coastal city of Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace and another redoubt of tribal leaders still loyal to him .

'' `` Our resolute Libyan people , the Libyan land is your own , '' said the 69-year-old who ran the country since he was 27 until two weeks ago . `` Those who try to take it from you now , they are intruders , they are mercenaries , they are stray dogs . '' Backing up his words , a cannonade of Grad missiles flew out of Bani Walid , a desert town south of Tripoli where a hard core of loyalists -- estimated by their opponents at about 150 -- are under siege by the new interim government . Some of its commanders suspect Gaddafi himself might be hiding inside . Two of the defenders were killed and one of the siege force wounded in overnight skirmishing , though a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council said the new rulers would abide by a truce until Saturday to allow negotiated surrenders at Bani Walid and Gaddafi 's home town of Sirte , on the coast . `` We can do it within two hours maximum , '' Ahmed Bani said of taking over Bani Walid . He said he believed Gaddafi 's son and heir-apparent Saif al-Islam was there , though he did not share the belief of some others in the NTC that his father was . Referring to the arrivals this week of senior Gaddafi aides in Niger , across the Sahara desert , which prompted speculation that could be an escape route , Bani said : `` He 's a fox . Maybe he wants us to believe that he 's out -LRB- of Libya -RRB- but he 's inside ... close to the border so that in an emergency he can escape . '' In remarks which clearly indicated he was speaking after the reports from Niger were published , Gaddafi said : `` This is not the first time that convoys drive in and out of Niger . '' Despite the sweeping and sudden nature of their victory in Tripoli two weeks ago after six months of civil war , the new leadership is still struggling to impose its authority across the capital and the rest of the sprawling , oil-rich desert nation which is home to just six million people . The stalemates around Sirte , Bani Walid and south into the desert town of Sabha -- all pro-Gaddafi bastions -- means the original rebel stronghold of Benghazi is still largely cut off from Tripoli , an 800-km -LRB- 500-mile -RRB- drive away to the west . NTC leaders have said they hope to be pumping oil again next week , and the new head of the central bank briefed the media on Thursday to assure Libyans and their foreign business partners that the bank had not been looted by fleeing members of the old regime . Business as usual was the watchword . In another nod to getting down to government , the interim prime minister Mahmoud Jibril was making his first appearance in Tripoli on Thursday since the uprising . But there is still considerable doubt , contradiction and hesitation about moving the operations of the NTC from Benghazi to the capital . Some of that delay appears to stem from long-standing regional rivalries and from a sense that Tripoli may not be a safe place for every Libyan official , as potentially rival militias coalesce around the rebel brigades which swept in to the city from different towns and provinces , eager for a share of power that for 42 years was in the hands of one man only . NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen assured Libyans the Western military alliance whose air power helped topple Gaddafi will keep up the pressure . `` NATO and our partners will continue the mission as long as the threat remains , but not a minute longer , '' Rasmussen said . `` Gaddafi and the remains of his machine must realize that there is nothing to be gained from more fighting . '' Nevertheless , Western officials are keen to play down the extent to which they will -- or can -- help track Gaddafi down . The U.S. ambassador to NATO , Ivo Daalder , said Gaddafi 's capture might not signal the end of the campaign : `` It is n't clear that if he were to be taken out that the whole thing would necessarily collapse ; we just do n't know that . `` We do know that if he does n't have the capability to pose a threat to civilians , then it does n't really matter . '' A diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , repeated alliance statements that NATO was not searching for Gaddafi and suggested its ground surveillance did not cover the south of Libya , which borders countries to which Gaddafi might flee . `` The operations plan that we adopted limited the area of operations to the coastal area , '' he said . `` It is very expensive and difficult to monitor the entire country , which is mostly desert and very big , '' he said . `` Since this was fundamentally about protecting people , rather than watching sands , this was where the resources were located .

For Qaddafi , if his resistance can give headache to the NTC and help his former loyalists have strong bargain -- why not keep NTC rebels on their toes .

The battles at the two towns broke out a day before a deadline set by Libya 's interim National Transitional Council for Gaddafi holdout towns to surrender or face onslaughts . NTC officials said the outbreaks of fighting meant the ceasefire had effectively been scrapped . That could pave the way for some of the final battles of a six-month civil war . Fighters besieging Bani Walid went into the town a day ahead of the deadline to protect civilians and were engaged in street-to-street fighting with Gaddafi forces , an NTC official near the town said . An NTC spokesman said battles also began outside Sirte in response to barrages of rockets fired by pro-Gaddafi forces . The two towns , along with the remote desert outpost of Sabha , are the main areas still in control of Gaddafi loyalists since NTC fighters overran his Tripoli headquarters last month . The NTC said it had also dispatched hundreds of fighters deep into the desert , headed toward Sabha where it was advancing . NTC official Abdallah Kanshil said fighters had entered Bani Walid from the north , east and south and had advanced as close as 2 km -LRB- 1.5 miles -RRB- from a market in the center . Anti-Gaddafi forces believe some of Gaddafi 's sons , and possibly even the ousted leader himself , are holed up in the town , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of the capital . NTC spokesman Ahmed Bani said battles had also erupted close to a river near Sirte after pro-Gaddafi forces fired rockets at NTC forces laying siege to it . The coastal city was just a village when Gaddafi was born there 69 years ago , but has become a power base , lavished with cash under his rule . `` They attacked our forces so we had to answer them . There was shelling and there was no way to avoid that , '' Bani said . Asked if the fighting meant Saturday 's ceasefire deadline had been effectively scrapped , he said : `` Yes , it was breakable . '' Kanshil estimated loyalist forces in Bani Walid at around 600 men , more than previous estimates . `` People are very afraid , that is why we have to go in , '' he said . Troops were still hoping to avert `` full-scale war '' and had entered Bani Walid without orders from central NTC command . One NTC fighter had been killed so far and four wounded in Bani Walid while three Gaddafi fighters were killed and three wounded , Kanshil said . Seven Gaddafi loyalists were captured . Reuters reporters near both towns said volleys of Grad rockets had been fired by Gaddafi loyalists at NTC fighters earlier in the day . Ambulances streamed back and forth with casualties from near Bani Walid , and NTC fighters grabbed crates of rocket-propelled grenades and mortars and raced to the front . Smoke rose from the frontline and NATO warplanes roared overhead . Officials at the National Transitional Council 's Tripoli military headquarters told Reuters that between 100 and 150 vehicles had set off into the desert for Sabha on Friday . More would leave in convoy later in the day and into Saturday . `` There are people going from Jadu , from Zintan , from Tripoli , there is a mixture , '' NTC fighter Abu Aziz Selem told Reuters as he rushed out of the capital with a Kalashnikov assault rifle slung over each of his shoulders . Families trickled out of Bani Walid before the fighting intensified , belongings crammed into their cars . `` I 'm taking my family away from war , '' said Khalid Ahmouda , stopping his car briefly to speak to Reuters . `` They are afraid because there will be a big fight today or tomorrow . '' His veiled wife , Oum Abdurahman , leaned from a window , holding her baby son . `` There 's no power , no food , no water . Many people want to leave but have no fuel for their cars and Gaddafi forces are preventing people from leaving , '' she said . `` They fire in the air to terrorise people . Today we managed to leave , '' she said , adding her brother-in-law was among 11 people killed in a May 25 crackdown on anti-Gaddafi protests . NTC officials at a checkpoint 30 km from Bani Walid said Gaddafi fighters had been captured . Reuters witnesses saw some men driven away with their hands tied behind them , as well as two bodies , said to be Gaddafi fighters , in a pick-up truck . Muammar Gaddafi 's location is still a mystery . In a defiant message broadcast on Thursday though , he said he was still in Libya to lead the fight against what he called `` rats '' and `` stray dogs '' who had taken over the capital . Interpol issued arrest warrants for him , his son Saif al-Islam and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi , all wanted by the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- for war crimes . Four top officials , including Gaddafi 's air force commander and a general in charge of his forces in the south , were among a new group of Libyans who have fled to neighboring Niger , officials in Niger said . Niger said it would respect its commitments to the Hague-based international court if Gaddafi or his sons arrived , but had accepted the lower-ranked officials as a humanitarian case . `` We are signatories of the -LRB- ICC 's -RRB- Rome Statute so they know what they are exposed to if they come , '' said the head of President Mahamadou Issoufou 's cabinet , Massaoudou Hassoumi . Most residents of Sabha , Bani Walid and Sirte are trapped and awaiting either a final battle or a surrender . `` We are not seeing many people leaving . How can they ? '' Khalid al-Riahi , an NTC commander outside Sabha , told Reuters by phone . `` They have no money , they ca n't afford to buy fuel , which is scarce and more expensive . The city is too remote to have regular supplies and the road is not safe at all . '' Sabha , deep in the desert , has been cut off from the rest of the country since shortly after the fall of Tripoli and little information is available about the situation in the town of 100,000 people , home to many sub-Saharan African migrants .

The media took chose its side from the beginning and has only reported from one side of the story .

Southern neighbor Niger said one of the fugitive former leader 's sons , Saadi Gaddafi , had turned up there after crossing the remote Sahara desert frontier . The National Transitional Council , which is trying to exert its control over the entire country three weeks after its fighters stormed Tripoli , said it plans to unveil a new , more inclusive government for the country in 7-10 days . It also said it had begun producing oil , Libya 's economic lifeblood , production of which had been all but halted throughout six months of civil war . In Tripoli , NTC fighters revealed they had captured Gaddafi 's foreign spy chief . The NTC says it will not declare Libya `` liberated '' until it has taken control of towns still in the hands of Gaddafi loyalists . It had given holdout towns a deadline of Saturday to surrender , and its fighters have been battling since Friday inside the town of Bani Walid . They said on Sunday they were meeting stiff resistance in the town 95 miles southeast of the capital and were also edging toward the ousted ruler 's birthplace Sirte . `` We are inside Bani Walid , we control big chunks of the city . There are still pockets of resistance , '' one fighter named Sabhil Warfalli said as he drove away from the front line in the town 95 miles southeast of Tripoli . But the advance into the town seems to have stalled after heavy fighting . NTC spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters the plan for Bani Walid for now was to wait . `` When our forces entered Bani Walid they found the brigades of Gaddafi using citizens as shields , '' he told reporters . He said Gaddafi fighters had put missile launchers on the roofs of houses with civilian families inside , making it impossible for NTC forces or their allied NATO war planes to strike . Fighters said they were meeting fiercer resistance than expected in the town . Ambulances were rushing between the front and field hospitals . A man who lived in the town center was driving out in a car packed with his wife , some small children and assorted family members . `` There is no food . People are trying to bring us food and medicine but Gaddafi gangs turn them away , '' he said . The NTC has made a priority of hunting down Gaddafi and his seven sons . Mustafa Abdel Jalil , the NTC chairman , said Gaddafi is still a threat as long as he is at large . `` Gaddafi still has money and gold , '' he said . `` These are the fundamental things that will allow him to find men . '' The justice minister of Niger said Gaddafi 's son Saadi had been intercepted in a convoy after crossing the frontier , heading in the direction of the oasis town of Agadez . Two of Gaddafi 's other sons , Mohamed and Hannibal , and his only daughter Aisha have already obtained shelter in Algeria . Three sons remain at large -- Mutassim and Khamis who both run elite military units , and Saif al-Islam , Gaddafi 's one-time heir apparent who like his father is wanted for war crimes by the international court in the Hague . One son , Saif al-Arab , was reported killed during the war . Asked what Saadi Gaddafi 's status in the country was , Niger Justice Minister Marou Adamou said only that Niger would fulfill its humanitarian obligations . Washington and others have put pressure on neighboring states not to shelter Gaddafi or officials who are wanted for crimes . The NTC , based for months in the eastern city of Benghazi , faces the difficult task of winning the support of all Libyans , including fighters from towns and cities in the west who did the bulk of the fighting in the rapid advance on Tripoli . The interim government also has to deliver on promises to quickly restart an economy frozen by international sanctions , the halt in oil production and an exodus of foreign worker . Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril announced the NTC would form a more inclusive interim government within 10 days . He said it had started to produce some oil on Saturday , but gave no details of where or how much . Inside the capital , Reuters reporters saw Bouzaid Dorda , a former prime minister who ran Gaddafi 's external spy service , held by a group of about 20 fighters under guard in a house in the capital 's Zenata district . A fighter said he would be handed over to the interim authorities later on Sunday . A tall , lanky figure in safari jacket and slip-on shoes , Dorda was sitting on a sofa and was not physically restrained but an armed guard sat beside him . He declined a request for an interview , but in response to an assertion by a fighter that he had killed people , he replied : `` Prove it . '' `` I am innocent until proven guilty . I am willing to be referred to the Libyan prosecutor general , '' he said . Visibly agitated , he added : `` You have to remember it was a regime already in existence . '' Bani Walid resident Khalifa Telisi , who had telephoned a family inside the town , said fighting was concentrated around the central market area , where Gaddafi forces were based . `` There is still resistance from the central market . All other parts of Bani Walid have been liberated , '' Telisi said . Inside the town , a pro-Gaddafi local radio station appealed for the city 's 100,000 people to fight to the death . `` We urge the people of Bani Walid to defend the city against the rats and armed gangs . Do n't back down . Fight to the death . We are waiting for you . You are just a bunch of gangsters . God is on our side , '' an announcer said . The language echoed turns of phrase used by Gaddafi in recent broadcasts . Gaddafi 's loyalists also control Sirte , which sits on the main east-west coastal highway , effectively cutting Libya in two . Advancing NTC troops said the front line was now about 90 km east of the city . Fighters were firing tanks and howitzers amid the sound of heavy machinegun fire and the roar of NATO warplanes overhead . `` There were clashes this morning and Gaddafi forces were firing Grad rockets , but we managed to advance a little bit and we will enter Sirte very soon , '' fighter Salah al-Shaery said . The United Nations says it is worried about the fate of civilians trapped inside the besieged pro-Gaddafi bastions . `` Our big concern right now is Sirte , where we are receiving reports that there 's no water and no electricity , '' U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told Reuters in an interview . She said the world body was also worried about the fate of sub-Saharan African migrants , who face revenge attacks as suspected mercenaries even though most are ordinary laborers . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The only hope for the rag-tag rebels is for their masters in the UN\\/NATO to apply their brutal scotch earth policy to bombard Qaddafi supporters and reduce entire cities to rubble . NATO do not really care about the tribes that want sovereignty , they need 100 % puppets . The rag-tags too are heartless , greedy and hungry to loot and revenge . NATO is itching for the oil\\/gas wealth and are already squabbling about contracts . More greed and exploitation will show soon and all Libyans will realize what is in store with the kind of NATO regime they are tying to put in place-led by the NTC proxy group . The whole war fiasco was imposed on Libyans , the rebels are unpopular , backward and racists eliminating dark skinned people , the UN is just a club for the west or in the pockets of the west . UN means very little to the rest of the world in the current state of the world . Why is the U.S. helping to overthrow Ghadaffi ? He was doing a fine job of keeping his muslims in check . When he is gone , we will probably see another chaos-causing islamic state similar to Iran . Military wing of Libyan `` rebel '' movement has strong links to Al Qaeda . This wing already assassinated the more moderate civilian-minded rebel commander -LRB- Younis -RRB- . After 9\\/11 Gaddafy collaborated with CIA and British intelligence to interrogate\\/torture Libyan Al Qaeda suspects . These same former suspects helped overthrow Gaddafy and are now in charge of Tripoli militias and gangs . Assuming they are not totally innocent of those Al Qaeda suspicions , then they will likely try to use Libya as new Al Qaeda base , like Afghanistan used to be , armed with all the weapons they took as trophies from Gaddafy-regime army . From this base they could launch attacks on other Middle East countries , as well as Europe and USA . A fine pickle it could turn out to be . This discussion is now closed .

He said pro-Gaddafi forces were now concentrated in the central market area -- an account backed up by a resident named Khalifa Telisi who had telephoned a family in the town . `` There is still resistance from the central market . All other parts of Bani Walid have been liberated , '' Telisi said . `` Another revolutionary battalion is coming in from the south . Gaddafi forces are scattered . It is a matter of hours now . '' A pro-Gaddafi local radio station appealed for the city 's 100,000 people to fight to the death . `` We urge the people of Bani Walid to defend the city against the rats and armed gangs . Do n't back down . Fight to the death . We are waiting for you . You are just a bunch of gangsters . God is on our side , '' an announcer said in language that echoed that used by Gaddafi in recent broadcasts . Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- is trying to capture Gaddafi 's last bastions and find the fugitive leader to assert its grip over the vast North African oil-producer and begin a countdown to elections and a new constitution . Gaddafi troops firing rockets and mortars have fought back against fighters trying to push into Bani Walid for two days . `` There has been ferocious resistance from them at Bani Walid , '' Jalil al-Galal , an NTC spokesman in Tripoli said . The NTC sent experienced reinforcements to join the fight , but fighters said they were awaiting a go-ahead from NATO , whose warplanes hit Gaddafi positions in the area on Saturday . `` Yesterday we set up checkpoints in Bani Walid but had to leave after NATO told us to do so . Today we 're waiting for their green light to go back in again , '' said a 42-year-old fighter named Abdenabi Abdulrahman outside the town . NATO says it has no contacts with the NTC , but confirmed its aircraft had been in action the day before . Gaddafi 's loyalists also control Sirte , which sits on the main east-west coastal highway , effectively cutting Libya in two . Advancin NTC troops said the front line was now about 90 km east of the city . Fighters were firing tanks and howitzers amid the sound of heavy machinegun fire and the roar of NATO warplanes overheard . `` There were clashes this morning and Gaddafi forces were firing Grad rockets , but we managed to advance a little bit and we will enter Sirte very soon , '' said fighter Salah al-Shaery . The pro-Gaddafi towns still holding out , as well as the uncertain loyalties of the vast desert interior , undermine the NTC 's efforts to show it is firmly in control of the country . NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , a former Gaddafi justice minister who has run the council from the eastern city of Benghazi , arrived in Tripoli on Saturday for the first time since bands of anti-Gaddafi rebels captured it on Aug. 23 . `` Brotherhood and warmth -- that 's what we will depend on to build our future . We are not at a time of retribution , '' Abdel Jalil declared . `` This is the time of unity and liberation . '' The NTC has said it will complete its move to Tripoli this week , although previous timelines for this have slipped . Establishing a credible interim government in the capital would mark an important step for Libya , where regional and factional rivalries among forces united only by contempt for Gaddafi could trouble efforts to reshape the country . The NTC also promised to resume oil production , virtually stalled since the civil war began six months ago , within days . But Abdel Jalil said Libya could not yet be declared `` liberated '' from the man who ruled it for 42 years . `` Gaddafi still has money and gold , '' he said . `` These are the fundamental things that will allow him to find men . '' The NTC had given the main pro-Gaddafi towns -- Sirte , Bani Walid and the remote desert outpost of Sabha -- until Saturday to surrender or face attack . Fighting around Sirte and Bani Walid erupted a day before the deadline . Anti-Gaddafi fighters believe one or two of the ousted leader 's sons may be holed up in Bani Walid . Some NTC officials have even suggested Gaddafi might be there . Others say he may be hiding deeper in the Sahara . Several former Gaddafi officials and generals have fled across the vast desert to neighbouring Niger . The toppled leader 's wife and three of his children found sanctuary in Algeria last month . Some civilians managed to flee Bani Walid on Sunday . `` We live right in the center . We are leaving because we want to be on the side of the revolution , '' said a man in a car with his wife , children and other relatives . `` For six months I could n't get out . There is no food . People are trying to bring us food and medicine but Gaddafi gangs turn them away , '' he said , referring to efforts by civilians to bring supplies into the besieged town . The original plan was for local fighters to enter Bani Walid to reassure residents and to encourage Gaddafi fighters to lay down their weapons and stay indoors . But NTC officials , who first estimated they were facing only 150 Gaddafi loyalists , now say their opponents number about 1,000 after an influx of extra men from other Gaddafi strongholds such as Sirte and Sabha . `` Last night the enemy fired many Grad rockets and mortars . We were under a hail of Grads . We do n't know what we 're going to do now . I have to admit , they have more experience than us , '' said Mohammed Ibrahim , a local anti-Gaddafi fighter .

The draft would have the council begin lifting six-month-old punitive measures imposed on Libya when its former leader Muammar Gaddafi was overseeing a crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators across the country . According to the draft resolution , obtained by Reuters , the resolution would ask the 15-nation council to ease sanctions against Libya 's National Oil Corp and central bank to enable those two key institutions to start functioning . The draft would have the council declare `` its determination to ensure that assets frozen pursuant to -LRB- U.N. sanctions resolutions -RRB- shall as soon as possible be made available to and for the benefit of the people of Libya . '' The National Oil Corp would become free of sanctions , which should enable the oil-producing OPEC member to begin exporting crude more easily once the resolution is approved . But some of the sanctions on other firms would remain in place . Assets of the central bank , the Libyan Foreign Bank , Libyan Investment Authority , and the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio that have been frozen abroad by U.N. member states are to remain frozen for the time being , unless they have been exempted from the freeze by the council 's sanctions committee . Such assets , the draft says , can only be released on the basis of a decision of the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee , which one senior Security Council diplomat said has already unfrozen $ 16 billion of Libyan assets to date . The council diplomat described the easing as a `` progressive or controlled lifting of the asset freeze . '' Speaking on condition of anonymity , he added that Britain , the drafter of the resolution , hoped to put it to a vote by Friday . ARMS EMBARGO , NO-FLY ZONE REMAIN IN PLACE Libya 's frozen assets have been held by various governments over the last half year in compliance with the U.N. sanctions regime imposed in February and March . The draft resolution does not call for an end to the no-fly zone over the North African state or an end to NATO 's authorization to protect civilians . But it does call for an easing of the arms embargo to enable Libyan authorities and U.N. security officials to import weapons needed to maintain security . The draft resolution also follows recommendations from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who asked the council to establish a U.N. mission to help advise Libya 's transitional leadership on restoring public order and security and preparing for democratic elections . The initial order for a mission would be valid for three months . The mission would not include peacekeepers or U.N. police to help maintain order in the country . But the mission , which diplomats say would have up to 200 staff , would help the government promote human rights , the draft says . Little resistance to the resolution is expected in the council , diplomats say , since nearly all members have concluded that Gaddafi is effectively no longer in control of Libya .

Egypt gave a lifeline to Gaddafi 's opponents based in eastern Libya by keeping the border open to flows of food and medical aid . But Cairo waited until the rebels fought their way to Gaddafi 's doorstep before officially recognizing them . Leaders of Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- have publicly said they will favor companies from countries which did most to support the rebellion . That could put Western countries such as France , Britain and the United States , which swiftly backed the rebels , ahead in the queue for business . Arab states such as Qatar , which provided early diplomatic , material and military support , may also get better treatment . `` I consider the opinion of the Egyptian government respectable and responsible , '' the NTC 's delegate to the Arab League in Cairo , Abdel Moneim El Houni , told Reuters . `` I of course would have wished something else as a Libyan . '' Hani Soufrakis , a Libyan businessman living in Cairo , noted that Egyptian authorities allowed Libya 's opposition to operate in Egypt during the uprising , which was a big help to the rebels . But Gaddafi-linked businesses in Egypt , such as hotels and real estate projects , were also permitted to continue working with impunity , he added . `` They allowed Gaddafi to keep doing essentially what he wanted and his investments here in Egypt were largely untouched , '' Soufrakis said . `` It 's still Gaddafi 's men running them . '' Analysts believe the new Egyptian government was distracted from Libya by other policy challenges after the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak earlier in the year , or it may have wanted to avoid committing itself to the uncertain result of a conflict on its doorstep . Either way , said Ezzedin Choukri-Fishere , international relations professor at the American University in Cairo : `` Egypt kind of pretended nothing was happening in Libya . '' Trying to make up for lost time in building relations with Libya 's new government , Egypt said it was sending a high-level foreign ministry delegation to Libya days after Gaddafi fled into hiding in late August . Egyptian firms are already lining up . Among them is El Sewedy Electric , which has exported its cables to Libya since 1999 and agreed in 2003 to set up a $ 64 million factory in Tripoli , although the project has yet to be developed . Chief Executive Ahmed el-Sewedy told Reuters that Egypt 's government was supporting Egyptian firms , but he said they would find competition in Libya tough and could face a challenge getting into a market that many have not ventured into for years , if at all . `` We thought Egyptian companies would have a lot of work with Libya . But I 'm not sure . All the world is now focusing on Libya and most Egyptian companies have not been there in the last 10 years ... For the new companies to go ahead it will be possible , but not easy . '' He added that orders for his company from Libya , which had been put on hold during the civil war , would now go ahead . `` For our manufacturing project there , we have to discuss with the new government to see what they want to do . '' Other Egyptian companies cited by analysts as possible contenders for business are Orascom Telecom and Orascom Construction . Both have a reputation for drumming up business in the toughest of emerging markets . Libya took slightly over 4 percent of Egypt 's exports of about $ 25 billion last year , before the civil war , Egyptian media quoted trade ministry officials in Cairo as saying . Officials on both sides say there is scope for trade to rise . Although the war has ravaged Libya 's economy , reconstruction demand -- for building materials , vehicles , machinery and other products -- is expected to be substantial . It could emerge quickly ; foreign lenders such as the International Monetary Fund are offering to provide short-term financing to Libya , and in the medium term it can expect to begin using an estimated $ 150 billion of sovereign assets that were once controlled by Gaddafi and his inner circle , and are now frozen abroad . Before the war , petrodollars lured hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Egypt , a country of 80 million people , to find jobs in Libya on farms and in factories and to work as carpenters , plumbers and mechanics . Many fled during the fighting , but others stayed and more are likely to return as Libya rebuilds . Houni said Egypt had since March provided Libya with electricity to replace capacity destroyed by Gaddafi 's forces in the conflict , and that further cooperation in the area of power was being discussed . Egypt , which has government institutions that survived the uprising to overthrow Mubarak in February , might also offer expertise to a fellow Arab state seeking to rebuild institutions that are in disarray after Gaddafi 's ouster . Libyan officials say Egypt could provide teachers , doctors and consultants to help revamp education , the police force , utilities and infrastructure . Egyptian investment bank Beltone Financial , which set up an office in Libya before Gaddafi was overthrown , said the change of government would create business opportunities for it , because foreign investors would become more interested in the Libyan economy . `` We expect from our own perspective that there will be plenty of mergers and acquisitions by European and Gulf entities in the Libyan market , '' said Khalid Helal , managing director at Beltone Securities International . Foreigners were already interested before the rebellion in telecommunications , steel , cement and other assets in Libya . Beltone had been helping to manage planned initial public offers of shares by Libyan mobile phone firms Madar and Libyana , Helal said . But he added that Egyptian firms could not afford to wait to pursue such opportunities : `` We in Egypt should start yesterday , because we will be in severe competition with Asians and Gulf states .

Full Article Britain seeks easing of UN sanctions on Libya UNITED NATIONS | Thu Sep 15 , 2011 4:29 am IST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain has circulated a draft resolution to Security Council members that would ease U.N. sanctions against Libya and hopes to have a vote on it this week , diplomats said on Wednesday . The draft would have the council begin lifting six-month-old punitive measures imposed on Libya when former leader Muammar Gaddafi was overseeing a crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators across the country . According to the draft resolution , obtained by Reuters , the resolution would ask the 15-nation council to ease sanctions against Libya 's National Oil Corp and central bank to enable those two key institutions to start functioning . The draft would have the council declare `` its determination to ensure that assets frozen pursuant to -LRB- U.N. sanctions resolutions -RRB- shall as soon as possible be made available to and for the benefit of the people of Libya . '' The National Oil Corp would become free of sanctions , which should enable the oil-producing OPEC member to begin exporting crude more easily once the resolution is approved . But some of the sanctions on other firms would remain in place . Assets of the central bank , the Libyan Foreign Bank , Libyan Investment Authority , and the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio that have been frozen abroad by U.N. member states are to remain frozen for the time being , unless they have been exempted from the freeze by the council 's sanctions committee . Such assets , the draft says , can only be released on the basis of a decision of the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee , which one senior Security Council diplomat said had already unfrozen $ 16 billion of Libyan assets to date . The council diplomat described the easing as a `` progressive or controlled lifting of the asset freeze . '' Speaking on condition of anonymity , he added that Britain , which drafted the resolution , hoped to put it to a vote by Friday . ARMS EMBARGO , NO-FLY ZONE REMAIN IN PLACE Libya 's frozen assets have been held by various governments over the past half year in compliance with the U.N. sanctions regime imposed in February and March . The draft resolution does not call for an end to the no-fly zone over the North African state or an end to NATO 's authorization to protect civilians . But it does call for an easing of the arms embargo to enable Libyan authorities and U.N. security officials to import weapons needed to maintain security . The draft resolution also follows recommendations from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who asked the council to establish a U.N. mission to help advise Libya 's transitional leadership on restoring public order and security and preparing for democratic elections . The initial order for a mission would be valid for three months . The mission would not include peacekeepers or U.N. police to help maintain order in the country . But the mission , which diplomats say would have up to 200 staff , would help the government promote human rights , the draft says . Little resistance to the resolution is expected in the council , diplomats say , since nearly all members have concluded that Gaddafi is effectively no longer in control of Libya . Russia and China , which worked hard to prevent the Security Council from waiving certain sanctions to aid the rebel forces during the Libyan civil war , are expected to support the resolution , diplomats say . Moscow and Beijing were highly critical of the U.N.-approved NATO intervention in Libya but both have recently recognized Libya 's National Transitional Council as the country 's legitimate government . A nine-person U.N. General Assembly credentials committee decided on Wednesday to recommend that diplomats representing Libya 's National Transitional Council be accredited to the world body , a U.N. diplomat said . Libya 's U.N. ambassador , Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham , and his deputy , who formerly represented Gaddafi but declared allegiance to the rebels in February , had been de-accredited by the United Nations at the request of the Gaddafi government . Diplomats said the General Assembly was likely to accept the committee 's recommendation on Friday . That is normally done by consensus , but several left-wing Latin American countries that had close ties with Gaddafi could force a vote , which they would likely lose , diplomats said . A U.N. official said Shalgham was expected to be reinstated in his post .

Such surges have become a regular feature of the market due to reduced supplies of oil related to Brent futures and the linked dated Brent physical market . They may also have been exaggerated by the popularity of trading the prompt spread . Brent crude futures for October delivery on Wednesday traded at a premium of as much as $ 2.83 a barrel to the November contract , the highest so-called backwardation since June 15 . The October contact expires on Thursday . `` Dated Brent is very well bid , and there seems to be less Forties cargoes coming on board all the time , '' said Rob Montefusco , a trader at Sucden Financial . `` I think it 's more a bit of a play at the moment of traders on the dated side . '' Analysts and traders say the trend is likely to diminish as the supply of Brent-related crude becomes more comfortable due to a restart of shipments in Libya and to hopes North Sea output will recover after months of underperformance . Libya , whose production was virtually halted by the civil war , is already restarting supplies . Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company said on Tuesday that production from the eastern oilfield of Sarir had reached 160,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- . Christophe Barret , an analyst at Credit Agricole , cited the weaker prices of Brent for delivery in later months as evidence that the strength of the spread will not persist . `` Later on , we will have much more relaxed balances , and that 's why you have prices that are coming down further down the curve , '' he said . `` I think there is real pressure on the market because of the loss of Libyan supply , '' he said of the spread at present . Previous spikes in the spread this year have peaked on contract expiries , such as on July 14 , June 15 and May 16 . Supply of Forties , the crude that usually sets the price of dated Brent , began to underperform noticeably in May because of problems at Nexen 's -LRB- NXY . TO -RRB- Buzzard field , which delayed shipments and supported prices . Delays have persisted into September , and in October less Forties is scheduled to load than in September . Forties ' premium to dated Brent hit $ 1.80 a barrel last week , the highest in more than three years . Olivier Jakob , analyst at Petromatrix , said there were a number of reasons for volatility in the Brent spread before expiries , including the fact it is a financially settled contract , developments in fundamentals and the reinforcing effect of trading . `` The physical premiums have been very strong , so it does justify a backwardation in Brent . Now should that backwardation be a dollar , two dollars , that is always a bit difficult to fully assess , '' he said . `` What the traders do can also be part of it . It 's a bit of a micro-market , so when you have some small imbalances , it will be traders ' job to trade around it . '' Montefusco of Sucden said the strength of the prompt spread could be difficult to repeat in coming months as supplies increase . `` It 's very well bid now , but hopefully going forward we 'll have a bit more oil around , '' he said . `` I think they are trying to get it out of the way now before we start getting this other oil coming back .

Full Article U.N. Security Council eases sanctions on Libya UNITED NATIONS | Sat Sep 17 , 2011 8:24 am IST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.N. Security Council on Friday eased sanctions on Libya , including on its national oil company and central bank , to enable key institutions to recover after rebels won a civil war . The 15-nation council voted unanimously for a resolution that also establishes a U.N. mission in Libya to help the North African nation get back on its feet after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi . The resolution begins lifting punitive measures imposed on the oil-exporting country six months ago when Gaddafi was overseeing a crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators . Despite arguments among council members since then over the application of previous resolutions , especially NATO 's bombing of Gaddafi 's forces , the council came together after Libya 's former rebels established control over most of the country . In Friday 's resolution , the council declared `` its determination to ensure that assets frozen pursuant to -LRB- U.N. sanctions resolutions -RRB- shall as soon as possible be made available to and for the benefit of the people of Libya . '' Earlier on Friday , the U.N. General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country 's interim government as Tripoli 's sole representatives at the world body , effectively recognizing the National Transitional Council . Both actions `` make clear the international community 's determination to support the new Libyan authorities , and the Libyan people , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . The Security Council resolution lifts all sanctions against the Libyan National Oil Corp and Zueitina Oil Co as part of what British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said was an effort to `` help kick-start Libya 's economy and encourage economic self-sufficiency . '' The British-drafted text also partly eases sanctions on the central bank and other Libyan institutions , although special approval by the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee will still be needed to unfreeze their seized assets . The committee has already authorized the emergency unfreezing of some $ 16 billion of Libyan assets , held mainly by Western countries , Security Council diplomats say . But some measures are being kept `` to ensure that previously frozen funds are released in a transparent and responsible way as the situation normalizes and the transition proceeds , '' U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told the council . Diplomats said one problem with immediately unfreezing all assets was confusion in some cases about exactly who would be able to benefit from them . An arms embargo will remain in place , but Libya 's interim government and the United Nations will be allowed to import light weapons to maintain security . The resolution establishes a U.N. mission in Libya , which diplomats say will consist of up to 200 people in an initial three-month phase to help the government with a post-conflict transition . Their tasks are expected to include police training and electoral assistance , U.N. officials say . The resolution does not call , however , for the deployment of peacekeepers or police as part of the new U.N. Support Mission in Libya . Nor does it call for an end to the no-fly zone a March resolution imposed over the country , although diplomats say Libyan civil airliners will be allowed to fly provided they notify monitors of their flight plans . Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin , a prominent critic of NATO 's air campaign in Libya , called for the prompt lifting of the no-fly-zone and also voiced concerns about human rights violations in Libya . `` It 's becoming increasingly clear that crimes were being committed by all parties to the conflict , '' he said . The National Transitional Council was represented at the Security Council meeting by Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy U.N. ambassador whose defection to the rebels in February inspired dozens of his country 's diplomats worldwide to denounce Gaddafi . `` A period of terror , of denial of freedom and violation of human rights has now come to an end for the Libyan people , '' Dabbashi told the council . He said Libya was the first instance of the much-quoted but seldom-applied U.N. `` responsibility to protect '' principle , `` which was done in a reasonable manner , which saved the lives of thousands of Libyans and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Libya .

Interim government forces fled in chaos from the town of Bani Walid and pulled back from Sirte after yet more failed attempts to storm Gaddafi 's final bastions and take control of the entire country . The political and military problems underscored how hard it would be to restore stability to Libya after Gaddafi was driven out of Tripoli last month . The former rebels ' executive committee , or cabinet , was dissolved last month . A new committee , to include officials responsible for defense and interior affairs , was supposed to be appointed by interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril on Sunday . But the talks broke down when his proposals did not receive full backing from all current members . `` We had an advisory meeting with the NTC in order to form a new cabinet . We have agreed on a number of portfolios . We still have more portfolios to be discussed , '' Jibril told reporters through a translator at a news conference on Sunday . A list of the approved ministries was not available , though sources familiar with the negotiations said that the position of Jibril himself was a sticking point during the talks . There was also disagreement about whether it is necessary to form a transitional government before the declaration of `` liberation '' - a concept that appears to include the capture of Gaddafi and the defeat of his loyalists who still hold three key towns . The NTC has drawn up a road map setting out plans for a new constitution and elections over a 20-month period , which should start once that declaration is made . With political negotiations bogged down , Sunday 's failed attempt to take Bani Walid set off angry recriminations among the attackers , who must capture the town and Gaddafi 's birthplace Sirte before they can declare Libya `` liberated '' . Since taking Tripoli last month , National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- fighters have tried several times to storm Bani Walid , 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- southeast of the capital , only to retreat under heavy fire and in disorder . NTC fighters said they had planned for tanks and pickup trucks with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers to lead Sunday 's attack , but foot soldiers had piled in first . `` There is a lack of organization so far . Infantry men are running in all directions , '' said Zakaria Tuham , a senior fighter with a Tripoli-based unit . `` Our commanders had been told that heavy artillery units had already gone ahead , but when we advanced into Bani Walid they were nowhere to be seen . `` Gaddafi forces were hitting us heavily with rockets and mortars , so we have pulled out . '' A Reuters reporter saw fighters withdraw around two km -LRB- more than a mile -RRB- after they had stormed into the town . NATO planes circled above the town later on Sunday and loud explosions were heard from the center , though it was not clear whether the planes had attacked . Anti-Gaddafi fighters from Bani Walid blamed comrades from elsewhere in Libya for being unwilling to coordinate . Those from elsewhere accused some local fighters of being traitors and passing information to Gaddafi loyalists . `` Commanders who are from the Warfalla tribe , they tell us one thing and then commanders from the other cities say something else . We do not understand anything , '' said pro-NTC fighter Mohamed Saleh . Some fighters openly disobeyed orders . In one incident , an officer from Bani Walid was heckled by troops from Tripoli after he tried to order them to stop randomly shooting in the air as they celebrated seizing a mortar from Gaddafi forces . `` You are not my boss . Do n't tell me what to do , '' one of the Tripoli fighters snapped back at him . Shells whistled above anti-Gaddafi positions and exploded across the desert valley as invisible snipers sprayed bullets from Bani Walid 's rooftops and smoke rose above the town . NTC fighters helped some families leave the town , driving them out in military trucks . `` The past two weeks have been awful but last night was particularly bad , '' said Zamzam al-Taher , a 38-year-old mother of four . `` We have been trapped here without a car and with no food . Snipers are everywhere . '' NTC forces and NATO warplanes also attacked Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace . Fighters launched rockets from the city 's southern entrance and traded fire with Gaddafi loyalists holed up in a conference center . `` The situation is very dangerous . There are so many snipers and all the types of weapons you can imagine , '' said fighter Mohamed Abdullah as rockets whooshed through the air and black smoke rose above the city . As in many episodes during Libya 's conflict , the front lines at Sirte and Bani Walid have moved back and forth , with shows of bravado crumbling in the reality of battle . An incoming shell landed within 200 meters of NTC-held lines , only to be met with return fire from NTC fighters shouting `` Allahu Akbar ! '' -LRB- God is greatest -RRB- . Speaking against the roar of NATO jets overhead , one anti-Gaddafi fighter at Sirte , Mahmoud Othman , said his men were helping families who had fled ahead of the next assault . `` We do n't want any more bloodshed between us . But if the Gaddafa want more blood , we are ready , '' he said , referring to the deposed leader 's tribe . `` In the end we want Gaddafi . '' A spokesman for Gaddafi told Syrian-based Arrai TV on Sunday that 17 `` mercenaries '' , including what he called French and British `` technical experts '' had been captured in Bani Walid . It was not immediately possible to verify the report . NATO , French and British officials had on Saturday denied a report by Arrai TV that NATO troops had been captured by Gaddafi loyalists . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . If the US had merely baldly stated that it desired a regime change and control over the Libyan oilfields , and then invaded forthwith , that would have truly spared civilian casualties . Instead , we have another UN `` police action '' civil war with all the inhuman brutality that entails ... The problem here is that we have become desensitized as a people to this . Daily we have a gawking , whorish media smilingly and mawkishly retailing of innocents killed in drive by drug gang warfare here at home . So why should we give pause when we are told of a young girl killed in her backyard in Libya by a stray bullet that one of the rebels shot into the air in celebration . The deceit of this charade is nothing less than disgusting , unless , of course , you have been lulled and stupefied like so many among us . Take a gander , if you dare , at Goya 's horrors of war etchings , look in the mirror and then ask yourself who is looking back ? An army that is supposedly at 15 % of its original force -LRB- according to NATO -RRB- is holding off attacks from the air and from the ground . As long as the NTC and their foreign backers do n't accept fact that the Gaddafi loyalists have the support and help of the people , Libya will continue in chaos . No future for anyone .

As cranes lifted containers and sacks of goods onto the docks , and trucks manoeuvred into position to be loaded , port interim manager Abddel Hakim al-Ghazawi told Reuters the installation was safe and called on insurance companies to reduce fees related to use of the facility . `` Tripoli 's sea port is totally secure . There is nothing that can be an obstacle for the arrival of goods and ships , '' he said . `` Already some companies have started to send ships , '' he said , adding goods were being unloaded efficiently and 85-90 percent of the port was functioning . The European Union lifted sanctions on Libyan ports , oil firms and banks on September 2 to try and help the country 's transition from four decades of Gaddafi 's rule . Mukhtar al-Akhdar , a military official in charge of the airport , told Reuters damage caused during the uprising has been repaired , the facility was `` totally secure '' and he hoped it would start operations by Thursday . `` The airport is ready for airplanes to arrive and depart , '' he said . `` We had to do some maintenance on the runway due to the shelling of the -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- militia , which is now fixed . We cleared the remains of the planes that were destroyed by the militia . '' Diplomats say Libyan civil airliners and flights carrying official delegations are allowed to fly provided they notify monitors of their flight plans in order to avoid NATO attack . The U.N. Security Council resolution imposed in March a no-fly zone for civilian flights over the country as part of international efforts to protect anti-government protesters under attack from Gaddafi loyalists . Libyan Arab Airlines and the ports of Tripoli , Al Khoms , Brega , Ras Lanuf , Zawiyah and Zuara were among the 28 Libyan entities , along with oil firms and banks , to be freed from restrictions on September 2 . The formal lifting of the sanctions came a day after world powers meeting in Paris freed up billions of dollars to help Libya 's new rulers rebuild the nation after 42 years of Gaddafi 's rule and six months of civil war . The port had been a focal point in the conflict , which has continued in the towns of Bani Walid and Sirte as interim government forces try to storm the final bastions held by fighters loyal to Gaddafi . In May , NATO sank eight Libyan warships and intercepted a fuel tanker it believed was heading for the military in the city in a marked escalation of its bombing campaign in Libya . After the strikes , Libyan officials took journalists to the city 's port where a small ship spewed smoke and flames . In late August , as anti-Gaddafi fighters overran the capital , they told a rescue ship not to dock at the port because it was too risky -- leaving thousands of foreigners stranded at their embassies waiting for the all clear to leave . -LRB- Editing by William Maclean and Sophie Hares -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Any advance on the town , which is still used as a military base , would be an important boost for government forces who are struggling to oust Gaddafi loyalists from the towns of Bani Walid and Sirte as well as to contain disunity in their ranks . Bani also denied an assertion by Gaddafi 's spokesman that his forces had captured 17 British and French nationals in the fight for Bani Walid . `` There are no British or French prisoners '' in the town , Bani said . The claim by Gaddafi 's spokesman Moussa Ibrahim that foreign security personnel had been captured could not be verified and no immediate proof was presented . `` A group was captured in Bani Walid consisting of 17 mercenaries . They are technical experts and they include consultative officers , '' Gaddafi spokesman Ibrahim said on Syria-based Arrai television , which has backed Gaddafi . `` Most of them are French , one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified , two English people and one Qatari . '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there were `` no French mercenaries in Libya , '' while the British foreign office said it had no information about whether the report was true . Qatar 's foreign ministry was not available for comment . NATO , which is staging air strikes on Gaddafi loyalist positions , says it has no troops on the ground in Libya . Western nations have sent special forces in the past , and media have reported that private security firms have aided anti-Gaddafi forces in training , target ting and with leadership . Gulf Arab states have also sent trainers and arms . Among the confirmed sightings of foreign security personnel in Libya during the conflict , the head of a French security firm was shot dead at a checkpoint in Benghazi in May , and British special forces troops were held for three days by rebels in March while escorting a spy trying to make contacts . The claim about the capture of foreign security personnel added to confusion about the situation in Libya nearly a month after Gaddafi was driven from power . The former leader 's loyalist holdouts have beaten back repeated assaults by National Transitional Council forces at Bani Walid and Gaddafi 's home city of Sirte . NTC fighters have been sent fleeing in disarray after failing to storm Gaddafi bastions . The NTC , still based in the eastern city of Benghazi , has faced questions about whether it can unify a country divided on tribal and local lines . A long-promised attempt to set up a more inclusive interim government fell apart overnight . On Monday , NTC forces were unable to approach the northern gate of Bani Walid , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli , to attack the town because of heavy gunfire from Gaddafi loyalists . `` There is a lack of organization so far . Infantrymen are running in all directions , '' said Zakaria Tuham , a senior fighter with a Tripoli-based unit . Many fighters spoke of tension between units drawn from Bani Walid itself and those from other parts of the country . Some fighters openly disobeyed orders . In one incident , an officer from Bani Walid was heckled by troops from Tripoli after he tried to order them to stop shooting in the air . NTC forces and NATO warplanes also attacked Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace , where assaults have been repelled . Hundreds of families were fleeing the city on Monday as NTC forces rolled up with huge rocket launchers and artillery . Humanitarian groups have voiced alarm at reported conditions in the besieged coastal city . `` There 's no electricity , no phone coverage . Nothing , '' resident Ibrahim Ramadan said , standing by a car packed with his family at a checkpoint . Interim government forces were handing out juice to civilians and rifling through their belongings to search for weapons . Residents said homes had been destroyed and cars smashed to pieces as disorder spread through the city . `` People are fed up . There are explosions going off everywhere and you do n't know where the bullets will come from next , '' said Abubakr , a resident making his way out of the city . `` Look at this , '' he said , pointing to a bullet hole in his windshield . `` Bullets are coming down from above . People are just firing randomly . '' In Benghazi , interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril failed to name a new cabinet on Sunday when his proposals did not receive full backing from all current members . `` We have agreed on a number of portfolios . We still have more portfolios to be discussed , '' Jibril told reporters at a news conference on Sunday . Sources familiar with the negotiations said Jibril 's own role had been a sticking point . There was also disagreement about whether it was right to form a transitional government before declaring Libya `` liberated , '' which NTC officials say can only happen when all Gaddafi loyalists are defeated . The political infighting reveals some of the fractures in an alliance that was united in civil war by hatred of Gaddafi but remains split among pro-Western liberals , underground Islamist guerrillas and defectors from Gaddafi 's government . The NTC has its roots in Libya 's east , but most of the militiamen who finally succeeded in driving Gaddafi out of Tripoli are from towns in the west . Fighters are organized by home town into units with little overall coordination . Nevertheless , many Libyans say they can tolerate confusion among the new rulers as the price of being rid of Gaddafi , who crushed all opposition during four decades of rule . `` The delay in the new government is n't important ... We need time to recover , '' engineer Mustafa Saab bin Ragheb told Reuters in Tripoli 's main Martyrs ' Square , where traffic police in crisply pressed which uniforms took up patrols on Monday for the first time since Gaddafi 's fall . `` Look , we finally got rid of that bloody monkey . We are better than before . We will hang him and his sons , and then we can breathe freely . It 's too early for politics . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . If you ca n't love your neighbors , and get their love , what 's the point . Nato countries have become the savages they claim to be attacking and killing in Libya . It 's all about oil and has little to do with saving lives and implementing European and American\\/Canadian style democracy . This discussion is now closed .

Before the conflict , Libya turned out 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of high quality crude and the loss of that oil has helped keep oil prices at historically high levels with Brent crude above $ 100 per barrel for most of this year . Libyan officials have said some oil output is likely to come back quickly and analysts say some fields will return to production much faster than expected . But Libya 's Sirte Basin , which holds about 80 percent of Libya 's proven oil reserves and accounted for the majority production before the war , could be more difficult to revive , according to John Hamilton , director at energy market consultancy Cross Border Information . Troops loyal to former leader Muammar Gaddafi controlled the Sirte Basin for much of the uprising and some areas could be hazardous , he said . `` It could take a lot of time to clear the mine fields and remove booby traps from installations in that area as Gaddafi held onto it for most of the war , '' he said . `` That 's where there could be nasty surprises . '' `` There will be a long , slow incremental process of building up to where they ought to be , and that could take much longer than people hope . It could be three years if it 's tough . '' Industry players are optimistic that the taps will be easy enough to turn back on in some oilfields . The chief executive of Austrian energy group OMV told Reuters it would take 12-18 months for oil production in Libya to get back to pre-war levels . Christopher Bellew , broker at Jefferies Bache said many in the market believed Libyan oil could come back on track even more quickly than this . `` In general , oil tends to come on stream quicker than people expect because there 's such a strong economic incentive to see the oil flowing , '' Bellew said . `` But there are the unknowns on whether civil war will continue and whether there will be attacks on instillations . '' While production has started at various oilfields , and tenders for sales of some oil have been submitted , there has been little significant volume of crude exported since the National Transitional Council took power . The way in which the first cargo was brought to market highlights the pitfalls for getting crude to world markets . Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- Agoco -RRB- filled a cargo which failed to attract buyers because of confusion over quality , traders said this week . Trading house Vitol re-offered the oil on Thursday . And a lack of experience leading to errors and slow progress in getting oilfields and refineries back up to scratch will likely be a theme that keeps a brake on progress as Libya struggles to attract back people with appropriate expertise . `` It will need tens of thousands of people to return , such as oil engineers from places like China and India , '' said Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy . `` Many will have left Libya in difficult circumstances , and may not want to go back . '' And while Libya post war -- at least so far -- looks to be in much better shape than Iraq , which was traumatised for years by sectarian violence , there are still plenty of obstacles in the way of a steady flow of oil . Oil companies that had significant operations have said they are unwilling to send staff back to fields that they operated before the hostilities erupted because they still see the situation as too unsafe and volatile . French oil major Total said on Monday that it was not planning to transport any Libyan crude oil for now . And even when companies are confident their staff will be safe , poor quality infrastructure will slow progress . `` There was not that much damage -LRB- caused by the fighting -RRB- , but the equipment was in a bad state before the war after decades of under-investment and mismanagement , '' Ciszuk said . -LRB- Editing by Christopher Johnson -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "40", "dct": "2011-09-22", "dates": ["2011-09-22", "2011-09-22", "2011-09-22", "2011-09-21", "2011-09-21", "2011-08-01", "2011-09-22", "2011-09-22", "2011-09-21", "2011-09-22", "2011-09-22", "2011-09-21"], "text": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . Full Article Gaddafi 's ex-premier jailed after fleeing Libya TRIPOLI | Thu Sep 22 , 2011 11:38 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's neighbor Tunisia jailed Muammar Gaddafi 's former prime minister on Thursday , and Libya 's new rulers said they were tightening their grip on the desert towns where Gaddafi himself may be hiding . In the highest profile detention of a Gaddafi associate to date , a Tunisian court sentenced ex-prime minister Al Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi to six months in jail on charges of illegally entering the country on Wednesday evening . `` Al-Mahmoudi was arrested yesterday evening , '' a Tunisian Interior Ministry official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . '' -LRB- He -RRB- was arrested because he entered Tunisian territory illegally ... He did not have an entry stamp in his passport . '' The justice minister in Libya 's new government said Tripoli would request that the former prime minister be extradited to stand trial in Libya . `` Baghdadi directly oversaw the operations which had to do with the killings of Libyans , '' the minister , Mohammed al-Alagi , said on Al Arabiya television station . The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , Libya 's de facto government since Gaddafi was swept from the capital last month , has been anxious to show that it can establish firm control over a country riven by tribal and regional rivalries . The new government said it was consolidating its grip on Sabha and other oasis towns in the far south of the country which had sided with Gaddafi . `` Our revolutionaries are controlling 100 percent of Sabha city , although there are some pockets of resistance by snipers , '' NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters in the capital , Tripoli . `` This resistance is hopeless ... They know very well that at the end of the day they will show the white flag or they will die . They are fighting for themselves , not for the tyrant , '' he said , referring to Gaddafi . Until now some parts of Sabha , the traditional base for Gaddafi 's own tribe about 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , had been occupied by fighters loyal to him . The council says its forces have now also taken control of Jufra , to the north-east of Sabha , and the nearby oasis towns of Sokna , Waddan , and Houn . The NTC official said the manhunt for Gaddafi , in hiding for weeks though he occasionally issues defiant audio messages , was drawing closer to its target . `` There is no whole tribe or city on Gaddafi 's side , '' said Bani . `` I 'm asking everyone in the south who has any news about the tyrant or his loyalists ... to notify the legal bodies about them . '' `` We are doing our best looking for the tyrant . There is some news here and there that he ran away from Sabha to another place but it can not be confirmed . '' In Tripoli on Thursday , the U.S. ambassador returned to work after a hiatus caused by the civil war , and predicted a quick end to the fighting . `` I think it is a matter of time -LRB- for -RRB- Gaddafi and his remaining loyalists . Their resistance is finished , '' Ambassador Gene Cretz told reporters at a ceremony to mark the re-opening of the U.S. mission . Libya 's interim government received a diplomatic boost when its neighbor Algeria recognized the NTC as the country 's legitimate representative , according to a report broadcast by Al Arabiya . Algeria was the last of Libya 's neighbors to grant recognition , and the two sides have for months been trading allegations . The NTC accused Algiers of abetting Gaddafi in the civil war , and Algeria said it was worried the new government was not firm enough on the threat from Islamist militants . Western security officials say good relations between Libya and Algeria are vital if they are to keep a lid on al Qaeda 's north African branch , which has kidnapped foreigners and attacked Western targets in the region . The country 's new rulers were faring less well on the battlefield , aside from advances in the far south . In the two biggest towns where Gaddafi loyalists are still holding out , Sirte and Bani Walid , the NTC 's offensive has been chaotic , raising fresh questions about the council 's ability to run the oil exporting country effectively . Despite support from NATO warplanes , government forces have struggled to capture Sirte , Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown and the biggest of the towns still outside their control . It is a thorny task because the sympathies of many residents lie with Gaddafi . The city typifies the challenges the NTC faces in reconciling the significant parts of the country that have tribal loyalties to Gaddafi or did not support the revolution . A spokesman for Gaddafi told Reuters on Thursday that NATO air strikes and interim government forces ' shelling of Sirte were killing civilians . `` Between yesterday and this morning , 151 civilians were killed inside their homes as the Grad rockets and other explosives fell upon their heads , '' Moussa Ibrahim said in a satellite phone call to Reuters from an undisclosed location . His claims could not be verified as journalists are unable to reach the city . NATO comment was not immediately available . There was a counter-claim from rebel fighters near Sirte , and from residents fleeting the city , who said that pro-Gaddafi forces had been executing people suspected of sympathising with the NTC forces . An NTC commander on the outskirts of Sirte , who gave his name as Saleh , showed Reuters a handwritten list of families whose members were said to have been executed in Sirte . `` One man , they cut him like this , '' the commander said , dragging his finger from the ends of his mouth across his cheeks . `` Another , they cut his lips . '' On the Western outskirts of Sirte on Thursday there was little fighting , and dozens of civilians poured out of the city through anti-Gaddafi checkpoints . Over on the eastern side of the city , NTC forces came under heavy artillery fire . One fighter there said pro-Gaddafi artillery batteries appeared to have found the range of the NTC tanks , positioned more than 50 km east of Sirte , and were targeting them . `` There has been heavy shelling from Gaddafi forces , '' said Adel Al-Tarhouni , an anti-Gaddafi fighter in the village of Sultana , which came under artillery attack . `` I was able to see palm trees cut from the top by the shrapnel . '' North of Bani Walid , NTC military forces brought forward tanks and Grad rocket launchers in preparation for a renewed attempt to take the town . It was not clear when that attack might begin . Later in the day , a Reuters reporter near the town said fighting had resumed after a lull , though it did not appear to be an all-out assault . Gaddafi loyalists were firing shells at NTC positions on the edge of the town , and plumes of smoke could be seen rising up from within Bani Walid . The offensive there has been frustrated by stiff resistance from well-drilled loyalist fighters , and also by a lack of organization among the NTC forces . They operate in disparate units based on their home towns , with little overall command . On Wednesday , one fighter shot his own head off and killed another fighter while handling a rocket-propelled grenade in full view of a Reuters team . In another incident , a fighter wounded himself and another fighter after losing control of his machinegun . The nascent NTC national army has tried to bring order . If the NTC is unable to swiftly assert its control over the country and its own forces , it could embarrass Western leaders , especially France 's Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain 's David Cameron , who took a gamble by backing the anti-Gaddafi leadership . `` We have set up a unified operations room to unite all brigades , '' said brigade commander Omar Kabout . `` The purpose is to increase coordination and end all this chaos because many rebels have arrived without commanders . We need to put them into brigades and stop all this random shooting . '' But the message was not getting through to all the fighters , many of whom go into battle wearing flip-flop sandals , T-shirts and jeans and have no military training . `` We do n't take orders from the NTC . We listen only to our own commander , '' said Ziyad Al Khemri , a fighter from the town of Zawiyah , just west of Tripoli . -LRB- Reporting by Tarek Amara in Tunis , Emma Farge in Tripoli , Maria Golovnian north of Bani Walid , Sherine El Madany east of Sirte , Alexander Dziadosz west of Sirte and Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers and Dina Zayed in Cairo ; Writing by Christian Lowe ; Editing by Roger Atwood -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "152", "dct": "2011-09-26", "dates": ["2011-09-26", "2011-09-26", "2011-09-26", "2012-02-01", "2010-01-01", "2011-07-01", "2013-01-01"], "text": "Mon Sep 26 , 2011 5:35 pm EDT CALGARY , Alberta -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Suncor Energy Inc said on Monday it is still unwilling to send its employees back to Libya even though its joint-venture partner there is getting ready to resume oil production in the strife-torn country . Kelli Stevens , a spokeswoman for Suncor , said the company has been in contact with partner Harouge Oil Operations `` and we 're aware of them taking steps to restart production '' . Stevens said Suncor is still concerned about the safety and security of its employees in Libya , and none of the expatriate employees it evacuated in February have yet returned . Oil production in Libya is resuming as forces of the National Transitional Council consolidate their control and sweep out Muammar Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists . Libya 's oil industry can restart without foreign firms , but analysts say a speedy return to prewar output of 1.6 million barrels per day will depend on their return . Suncor 's share of its exploration and production sharing agreements with Libya 's National Oil Co averaged about 35,000 bpd before civil war disrupted operations . It picked up the fields in the Sirte Basin of Libya in its 2010 acquisition of Petro-Canada . The company wrote down the value of the operations in July by C$ 514 million -LRB- $ 500 million -RRB- .

The oil and gas group said in a statement on Monday it had restarted production in 15 Libyan wells in the Abu Attifel field , some 300 kilometres south of Benghazi . Production at the field is around 31,900 barrels of oil per day , it said . That compares to pre-civil war daily output of around 70,000 barrels . `` The foreign operators already present are starting operations as fast as possible , proving their existing contracts are not at risk , '' a Milan-based oil industry specialist said . Eni was the largest foreign oil producer in Libya before the civil war and is keen to mend relations with interim government leaders , after hesitant Italian support for the uprising in its early stages . Some analysts have expressed concern Eni could lose assets or opportunities in the long run if Rome 's lukewarm early support for the rebels triggers a backlash . In Libya since 1959 , Eni produced about 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010 . Its oil production contracts are in force until 2042 and gas contracts until 2047 . Eni 's adjusted net profit in the second quarter of this year fell 14 percent , hit by oil and gas disruption in Libya . Eni shares closed up 1.37 percent at 12.54 euros . Eni said on Monday that other wells in Abu Attifel would be reactivated in coming days to reach the volume required to fill the pipeline connecting the field to the Zuetina terminal . `` Things are clearly going better and faster than the pessimists thought , '' said Davide Tabarelli , head of energy think-tank Nomisma Energie . In August , Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said it would take six to 18 months to resume its oil production in Libya depending on the fields . France 's Total said on Friday production at its Al-Jurf offshore field in Libya had restarted , earlier than expected . `` There 's a lot of potential in Libya and I believe we could be looking to go back not just to production levels before the war but to the levels of more than 3 million barrels per day we had before Gaddafi came to power , '' Tabarelli said . Libya was producing 1.6 million barrels of oil per day before the uprising against leader Muammar Gaddafi began in February . The civil war caused foreign workers to flee and some oilfields and export terminals were damaged . Last Thursday , a senior source in the National Oil Corporation told Reuters that Libya 's oil production is set to reach 500,000 barrels per day by early October . Italian oil refiner Saras welcomed the news of Eni 's production resumption , and said it hoped to restart crude shipment operations with Libya before the end of the year . Before the Libyan conflict began Saras sourced about 35 percent of its crude shipments from Libya . Light sweet crude , easier to refine than other types and so difficult to replace , accounted for around 25 percent of Saras ' Libyan shipments . Half of this came from the Abu Attifel field .

In a trip to Libya this month , just weeks after Muammar Qaddafi s fall , I found peace coming fast to Tripoli , despite continued resistance in several Libyan towns . Ten days ago , families with children mobbed Martyrs square , where Qaddafi once held forth , to commemorate the hanging 80 years ago of Libya s hero of resistance against the Italians , Omar Mukhtar . Elementary schools opened last week . The university will open next month . Water and electricity are flowing . Uniformed police are on the street . Trash collection is haphazard but functioning . This is the fastest post-war recovery I have witnessed : faster than Bosnia , Kosovo , Iraq or Afghanistan . Certainly faster than Somalia , Sierra Leone or Rwanda . Why this rapid recovery in a country marked by four decades of dictatorship ? Why does Libya seem on track while Egypt seems to have gone off the rails ? Libya has at least three important advantages : good leadership and clear goals at the national and local levels , careful planning and adequate resources . Libyans believe Mustafa Abdel Jalil , who leads the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , is uncorrupted and uninterested in continuing in power . He has pledged not to seek future office . He has visited the liberated cities to celebrate the single goal of freeing Libya from the Qaddafi regime . The NTC has replaced Qaddafi s green flag with the red , black and green banner emblazoned with the star and crescent that was Libya s flag at independence . The revolution in Libya was not interested in compromise or a managed transition . It wanted a clean break : Qaddafi out and a new , more democratic regime , in . The NTC and a clandestine Tripoli local council planned carefully for the military takeover of Tripoli and the restoration of services in the aftermath . With three hundred mosques playing CDs chanting Allahu akbar ! Qaddafi s forces on the evening of August 20 found themselves confused and then attacked from both inside and outside the city , which fell far more easily than anticipated . In the weeks since , the new , unpaid local administration has achieved a great deal . It sent technicians hundreds of kilometers to the south with support from local tribesmen to reactivate the wells that pump water into Qaddafi s Great Man-made River , which supplies Tripoli and other population centers . The national government is making the usual social welfare payments . Flour and oil subsidies have been maintained , so bread is cheap and available . Only partial withdrawal of salaries from banks is permitted , but Libyans are confident about the country s economic future , based on its oil and gas resources . Libyans know what to expect next . The NTC has promised elections for an interim assembly by April 2012 and presidential elections by April 2013 . It has published a constitutional framework that establishes Libya as both Islamic and democratic . The contrast with Egypt , where I spent a week earlier this month , is striking . Egypt is a much larger , more complicated and poorer country . There unity around the demand for President Hosni Mubarak s resignation deteriorated quickly once he resigned . Little planning had been done . The protesters asked the army to take over . Unprepared , it had to postpone elections even as the protest movement split , with secularists demanding a constitution , or at least constitutional principles , before elections and Islamists preferring it the other way around . Egyptians now do not know what to expect , though the first round of elections is now promised for November . Some of the protesters have now targeted Israel , diverting attention from Egypt s own problems and scaring off European and American tourists . The economy is in a nose dive . Resources are highly constrained . Things could go wrong in Libya . We are still in the early days . Qaddafi s forces could go underground and conduct the kind of insurgency that Saddam Hussein s secret services ignited in Iraq . Fighting could erupt among the many militias that constitute the NTC s military forces . Many of them came from outside Tripoli . They may refuse to go home or to disarm . Is the author of this article reporting from the Quatari sound stage where some of the Libyan press propaganda was filmed ? -LRB- events that never took place in Libya -RRB- There is no electricity , water is scarce , Tripoli is in ruins , people are dying . There is gunfire and daily skirmishes . When you carpet bomb a City it takes decades to rebuild it . When I went to Dresden in 1992 , scars from WWII were still visible even after 40 years of the Allied carpet bombing . I suspect that Mr Serwer has never been to Libya or even in Africa : `` Trash collection is haphazard but functioning . '' Without being facetious , there is no trash collecting in most African countries . People throw rubbish all over the place . As long it is not in the way , it stays there until decomposes . Dead donkeys , coke bottles , masonry . `` This is the fastest post-war recovery I have witnessed '' I am not sure if the author is aware that Libya is still at war . The rebels are blowing up houses belonging to Ghaddafi supporters . Civil war is brewing . Since you think all is well in Tripoli , why do n't you go there on a holiday with your family to collect landmines ? Another delusional article from Reuters ... This article is pure propaganda and fabricated reality . Tripoli is in absolute shambles . The TNC does not command the mob of rebels much less Libyan society . Reuters is busy fabricating a virtual reality instead of providing news on the ground . Now this is what I call propaganda , what a weak article . Really , do you really believe people buy in to this garbage ? why are we crazy about exporting democracy to people in stone age ? reuters sucks ... Weak article ... The idea is to make people believe that is everything ok in lybia when the reality is completly different . Comparison with Egypt is even worse . They will never mention that the western powers support the military junta and the delay of a real democracy there since most of the egyptians are against Israel . So sad ... I really expected more from Reuters . in reality Libya WAS ! one of the most advanced nations in Africa\\/Arab world , after NTC and NATO ? how many years has it been sent back ? how do you know if the NTC wants democracy ? they are full of ex members of the LIFG . and other Islamist groups . what do you really know about them ? The war in Libya did not start with the USA or NATO bombing , it started with Gaddafi bombing his own people and Libyan cities . I have been to Libya and am traveling to Tripoli again on Tuesday . The speed with which the country is coming together in the aftermath of the war is truly amazing . There are still pockets of resistance in a couple of towns , but overall , Libya will be entirely freed from the captive of Gaddafi and his regime . Libya will not submit to any foreign intervention and will create its own democratic state . The rebuilding of Libya will be quick and effective . The people of Libya are determined not to repeat the lessons they have learned from the 41 of Gaddafi rule . Those who believe Libya was one of the most advanced nations in Africa prior to 17 February revolution should get their heads out of the sand and visit the many deprived towns and cities in Libya where people are still living in shacks after 41 years of the Gaddafi rule and where the average Libyan salary was no more than $ 200 per month ! A very accurate assessment of Tripoli , which I can confirm 100 % personally as I am currently sitting in my bedroom in the middle of Tripoli . Electricity is connected , water is running , food is plentiful , although still slightly more expensive than usual . Rubbish is collected by neighborhood volunteers , and I must admit it is being collected far more frequently than before . There is still multiple checkpoints throughout Tripoli , mainly present because Gaddafi supporters still wont accept defeat and still go around shooting people randomly in drive-by shootings . However , there has been very very few incidences of revenge by the freedom fighters and the Pro-democracy Tripoli population in general . Most previous supporters where allowed to assimilate with the revolutionaries , especially if they have no blood on their hands . Gaddafi supporters that are armed have been requested to give up their arms voluntarily and most obliged . The Gaddafi supporters that refused to unarm had their weapons confiscated by force . Generally , the atmosphere is very positive in Tripoli . Every night families go out to Martyrs Square to celebrate the victory . In closing , I am surprised at the ill-informed comments , I thought reuters readers were more civilized and informed . Daniel Serwer is one of the very architects behind NATO intervention in Libya -- so do you think he 's going to admit it is a disaster unraveling into NATO sanctioned , even assisted genocide , with entire cities , Tawarga for example with a population of 10,000 being exterminated , imprisoned or exiled ? Nope -- shame on Reuters for serving as an outlet for these craven liars , then again , you should know that Reuters is a member of many of these unelected policy think tanks were atrocities like NATO 's Libya intervention are cooked up in the first place . `` Libya has at least three important advantages : good leadership and clear goals at the national and local levels , careful planning and adequate resources . '' You got to be kidding ! Good leadership -- a mixture of Islamists , former Kaddafi minsters and Esatern tribal leaders , that are already fighting each other and this will only continue . `` Careful planning '' ? NATO '' s bombing of Sirte ? Or summary executions of those who do not support the NTC ? `` Adequate resources '' ? Lybia does have oil and it is its main source of revenue . But now it was crippled by the war and will be taken over by the foreign oil producres , like TOTAL , Chevron and others . This article is a joke , insulting people 's intelligence . Not everyone is completely zombified by Al Jazeera , CNN and Fox . Cmon Serwer , some people here had also visited Lybia and have a very different picture . Daniel Serwer is a pathetic neo-colonialist short in morals & judgement . If Tripoli is safe , why has NTC not moved there ? Why contribute & condone the attack\\/murder of innocent people in Libya when that country has n't attacked any other ? The world is watching you people ! Unless you you descent from your towers of superiority & arrogance , we will bring you down by force ! Is that the way to use the world 's resources , to destroy other resources & pollute an already suffering environment , while ignoring cries of enpoverished masses living next door to your mansions ? The taciturnity of time will judge us all . A very accurate assessment of Tripoli , which I can confirm 100 % personally as I am currently sitting in my bedroom in the middle of Tripoli . '' It 's no good . They wo n't believe you . If it has done one thing , the Arab Revolution has dragged a lot of squalid apologists for dictatorship out of a range of closets . From the ` liberal ' wimps to the Spartist ` Left ' , to Fox News and the Tea Party . Not to mention the Born-again Islamophobes . All of them screaming in defense of the Imperialist puppet Gadaffi . And all destined for the dustbin of history , having completely failed to grasp that the world has changed . But Libya can take the risk of ignoring their ideological dilemma , and their monumental arrogance in demanding that they run their country one way or another . It is now theirs to run however they wish . It is clear that the individuals criticizing this article have not been to Libya . NTC and NATO have saved the Libyan people .

SIRTE , Libya | Tue Sep 27 , 2011 6:47 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Intense sniper and artillery fire from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi holed up in Sirte kept fighters with Libya 's new rulers at bay in the deposed leader 's hometown on Wednesday . Sirte , one of the last two bastions of support for Gaddafi , is encircled by forces with the interim National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- and under aerial attack from NATO . NTC fighters have been meeting stiff resistance from Gaddafi loyalists , who have managed to hang on to much of Sirte more than a month after the fall of the Libyan leader 's regime . Lack of coordination and divisions at the front have been hampering their attempts to capture Sirte and Bani Walid , which lies 180 km -LRB- 110 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli . A commander leading the attack on Sirte said on Tuesday he was in talks with elders inside the city about a truce , but the head of another anti-Gaddafi unit rejected negotiations . There were clashes at a roundabout 2 km -LRB- 1.5 miles -RRB- east of the center of Sirte , where anti-Gaddafi fighters were pinned down for a second day by sniper and artillery fire . Forces with the new government brought in two tanks and trucks carrying infantry to try to break through . Snipers , though , held up the advance , forcing the attackers to take cover behind metal shipping containers . Medical workers at a hospital in Ras Lanuf , which lies 220 km -LRB- 137 miles -RRB- east of Sirte , said they had received the bodies of six NTC fighters killed in fighting on the city 's eastern front . Some 45 fighters were wounded , many from sniper fire . While the fighting continues , humanitarian organizations have expressed alarm at the worsening situation in Sirte . `` Our main worry is the people being displaced because of the fighting , '' said Jafar Vishtawi , a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- , near Sirte . Taking Sirte , 450 km east of Tripoli , would bring Libya 's new rulers closer to gaining control of the whole country , something still eluding them more than a month after their fighters seized the capital . It is likely some members of Gaddafi 's family are in Sirte but there is no information about the location of the former ruler himself . He is the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant . A Syria-based television station that has been broadcasting audio speeches by Gaddafi , reported on Tuesday that the toppled leader had addressed his supporters and urged them to fight in a speech broadcast on a local radio station in Bani Walid . The report by Arrai television could not be independently verified . Arrai also broadcast footage of what it said was Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam , dated September 20 , rallying his forces at an unidentified location . `` This land is the land of your forefathers . Do n't hand it over , '' Saif al-Islam , shouted to a crowd of followers . In neighboring Algeria , the government ordered members of Gaddafi 's family in exile there to stay out of politics after Gaddafi 's daughter Aisha angered the NTC by telling the media her father was still fighting to hold on to power . Aisha Gaddafi , her brothers Hannibal and Mohammed , their mother Safia and several other family members fled in August . In a separate development , a Tunisian court of appeal freed Gaddafi 's former Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi , who was sentenced to six months in jail last week after he was arrested near the North African country 's border with Algeria . Shortly after the ruling , a source at the Justice Ministry told Reuters that Tunisia had not received any request from the NTC to extradite al-Mahmoudi . Libya 's new rulers received an important boost when exports of crude oil -- the country 's only major source of revenue -- resumed for the first time in months . The head of Libya 's port authority said a cargo of crude oil had sailed on September 25 from the port of Marsa el Hariga , bound for Italy . It was only the third cargo to leave Libya since the rebellion against Gaddafi 's rule began in February . `` We are working hard to make everything run normally at the ports , '' Capt. Ramadan Boumadyan said in an interview . `` I think everything will be back to normal in a month 's time . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Extending a truce will only prolong the conflict . And why would the rebels give a truce so the regime 's fighters so they can regroup . This discussion is now closed .

Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday attempted to wrest control of a central town from military forces that had gone over to the opposition , whilst in other towns there were also reports of fighters coming together . Details were far from clear and diplomats and other sources said defecting units appeared a `` hodgepodge '' who might struggle to mount a sustained fight against superior forces . Protesters have occasionally seized weapons to attack security forces , but witnesses say protests have been generally peaceful . The appearance of loosely organized groups of military deserters lends a new dimension to the uprising . `` The strategy of peaceful opposition is clearly losing ground in the face of Assad 's brutal counter response and the call to arms is gaining currency as the only way of dislodging the regime , '' said Julien Barnes-Dacey , Middle East analyst at London-based consultancy Control Risks . `` The key question is whether or not this will spread and result in a more decisive break right across the military . '' Most believe that is unlikely . Syria 's military has long been divided along sectarian lines and most expect that the units most dedicated to Assad -- made up largely of Alawites who are an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam -- will remain loyal . That could leave neither side with the strength to win and open the door to months or years of war . The risk , experts say , is that neither side feels they can back down with the opposition fearing they will be hunted down and killed if Assad can reassert control whilst Alawites and other allied groups fear reprisals if he goes . Whilst some in Syria 's somewhat unsupported opposition may have ambitions of repeating the success of their counterparts in Libya in ultimately marching on the capital and taking power , few analysts believe that a plausible imminent outcome . `` The regime will most likely use this to in order to justify and further intensify its bloody crackdown , '' says Anthony Skinner , Middle East and North Africa director at political risk consultancy Maplecroft . `` This increases the risk of Syria sliding into a civil war . '' Some worry about a further regionalization of the conflict . In Bahrain , largely Sunni Gulf states backed the monarchy as it crushed unrest from primarily Shi'ite demonstrators demanding equal rights in jobs and public services . That raised hackles on both sides of the Middle East 's sectarian divide that could worsen further if largely Shi'ite Iran ramps up support for its long-time ally Assad and Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia move closer to backing the opposition . `` This has a lot of worrying regional implications , particularly if it leads to Syria moving toward becoming a failed state , '' said Stephen Heydemann , a senior vice president and regional specialist at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington . `` There 's a risk it could exacerbate regional tensions that have already been made worse by Bahrain . '' Sectarian fighting in Syria could also raise tensions between assorted other smaller cross-border groupings in neighboring countries including Alawites and Kurds in Turkey and Shi'ites and Sunnis in Lebanon . For now , analysts say it is still too soon to say whether enough soldiers will defect to form a force that could be a significant military threat to the Damascus government . `` The rate of defections is increasing , '' says Alan Fraser , Middle East analyst for London-based risk consultancy AKE . `` However ... it is coming amid a fall in the number of protests throughout the country -- which are slowly losing momentum amid the ongoing crackdown . It will take significantly greater numbers of defectors to significantly threaten the regime . '' Nor is it yet clear to what extent the wider , somewhat disparate opposition movement wants to embrace a more violent approach . The Syrian National Council , a unified opposition formed this month to support the uprising , and the Local Coordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , the grassroots activist network that has powered the rolling demonstrations across Syria over the past six months , are explicitly against recourse to violence . `` It is not a countrywide trend , '' said Peter Harling of the International Crisis Group . `` In parts of the country people have been preparing themselves ... but continue showing restraint . In others , they simply can not afford weapons . '' In the longer run , some analysts say the opposition 's best hope is to try to hang on in the hope that ever tightening sanctions take their toll on Assad 's rule . Sanctions will likely starve his government of the oil sales that make up some 30 percent of government revenue , whilst much of the wider economy is also now effectively moribund or shut down . `` The Libya option is n't there , particularly because the Europeans and other regional powers are n't willing to play the role they played in Libya , '' said Jon Alterman , Middle East program director of the Center for Security and International Studies in Washington DC . `` There might be the option of some kind of covert operations support for the opposition but it 's hard to see what the point or strategy might be . '' Many outside groups working with Syria 's protesters have long tried to persuade them that taking up arms is the wrong way of pursuing their struggle , encouraging them instead to pursue non-violent methods such as boycotts and strikes . `` Any violence committed by opposition forces will harm the movement , '' said Srdja Popovic , a Serbian activist involved in the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic in 2001 and who now works with dissident groups worldwide including the Syrians . `` It will also diminish the possibility of achieving unity within the Syrian people and building a realistic alternative . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Just like in Egypt , Libya and Tunis , this uprising is to get rid of the brutal police state and implement a free democracy . This regime has a record of extreme brutality when dealing with anyone with an opinion , and people are sick of that and want change .

I have n't seen any action , '' the 29-year-old electronics dealer said as he sat near a mosque in the embattled city of Sirte , where scores of men , women and children who fled their home town of Tawargha have found a precarious refuge . The families could not go home , they said , out of fear of reprisal attacks by anti-Gaddafi fighters from nearby Misrata who have accused them of harbouring the ousted leader 's troops and committing atrocities during a brutal , months-long siege . Tawargha , once home to thousands of people , is now almost entirely deserted , its windows smashed , its stores looted and its walls speckled with gunfire . Its inhabitants have scattered across Libya , many to cities such as Benghazi and Tripoli . The fate of the town , about 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- from Misrata , has posed a disquieting challenge for Libya 's new leaders in the interim National Transitional Council NTC . L as they try to reunify the war-scarred country and impose the rule of law . Adding to the issue 's sensitivity , Tawargha 's residents are overwhelmingly black , a legacy of the town 's history as a transit point in the 19th-century slave trade , locals say . Many young fighters have treated dark-skinned people with suspicion during the revolt because of reports Gaddafi hired mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa , but the feud between Tawargha and Misrata appears to be about more than just race . The NTC 's handling of the crisis will test its ability to rein in Libya 's many largely independent militias and prevent reprisals that could fuel bloodshed and recrimination . `` Those who committed crimes should be brought to justice , but it 's important not to generalise , '' NTC spokesman Jalal al-Gallal said , adding that the council favored the return of Tawargha 's residents , but that this would take time . `` At the moment it 's a very , very sensitive topic , '' Gallal said . `` The Misratans are still simmering . '' The derogatory graffiti covering Tawargha 's walls makes it clear where many local fighters stand on the question of return . `` Tawargha , you dogs , 3,000 km this way , '' reads one message spray-painted on a road sign , beside an arrow pointing south into the Sahara desert . `` Formerly Tawargha , '' says another . Many of Tawargha 's erstwhile residents say they see little hope of returning home , partly because their dark skin makes them obvious targets for vengeful fighters in the area . `` It 's about the color of the skin . That 's why they have problems with Tawargha , '' Samia Taher , a light-skinned Libyan woman born in Illinois who married into a Tawargha family , said as she rested near the mosque where families sheltered , a couple of km -LRB- miles -RRB- from the heart of Sirte , besieged by NTC forces . She was interrupted by a burst of tank fire from a nearby hill . Women in brightly-coloured headscarves gasped and children flinched as the boom echoed through the lot , where mattresses and blankets were piled up and men rested in the shade . `` I just want to get the family out of here . We 're in the middle of a battle here in Sirte , '' Taher , speaking in American-accented English , said of the struggle for Gaddafi 's birthplace . Many NTC fighters deny their feud with Tawargha is about race . But they are openly hostile toward the town , which they say supported Gaddafi in return for money and services . Even before the war , Misrata residents disparaged Tawargha , calling its young people criminals and drug addicts , or accusing its menfolk of marrying often and working little . Scorn turned to outright hostility after Gaddafi 's forces assaulted Misrata with rockets , snipers and artillery to try to quash the uprising there in February , using Tawargha as a staging ground for a siege that killed more than 1,000 people . With the help of NATO air strikes , anti-Gaddafi rebels were able to break the siege and take control of Tawargha . The charred husks of tanks , unexploded rockets and bullet casings on the outskirts of the town testify to the battle 's ferocity . Many in Misrata accuse men from Tawargha of looting homes and raping women in Misrata during the siege , claims that are impossible to confirm , but display the depth of their enmity . As evidence , one resident offered a cell phone video he said was found on a slain Gaddafi soldier . It showed scores of black men in green military jackets with assault rifles marching down a tree-lined road he said led from Tawargha to Misrata . Tawarghy and other residents admit that support for Gaddafi ran strong in their town , but are quick to add that this does not justify demonising and punishing an entire community . Some of those who have taken refuge in cities along the Mediterranean coast say their homes in Tawargha have been burned and that relatives or neighbors have been abducted or attacked . The group of about 135 sheltering near Sirte ricocheted for months from town to town in search of a haven , only to end up in the crossfire of one of the civil war 's last battles . `` It 's all very tragic . We lack security and safety , and we have to worry about food , '' Tawarghy -- the name he gave meaning one from Tawargha -- said . `` All this and you 're calling for freedom ? What kind of freedom are you seeking ? '' Gallal , the NTC spokesman , said he expected residents who had not committed crimes to return to their homes eventually . `` The other solution would be mass relocation of people . That 's hardly an ideal solution . Things are tense at the moment , but I think in time they will fall into place , '' he said . Any such restitution is sure to be complicated . Much of Tawargha is in ruins . The charred skeletons of cars , busted electronics and garbage cover the streets between bullet-scarred apartment blocks . Goats and camels wander amid the wreckage . Green flags , a symbol of support for Gaddafi , still flutter over many buildings , more than a month after the deposed leader 's forces were pushed out of the capital , Tripoli . Despite NTC assurances , many in Misrata say it would only lead to more violence if Tawargha 's residents were allowed to return , even if some were innocent . The crimes against Misrata were just too many and too heinous , they say . `` To avoid the recurrence of any future problems , we should separate the two groups , '' said a Misrata man named Saleh as he stood near a Tawargha apartment block being used as temporary shelter for non-Tawargha families fleeing fighting in Sirte . `` They should be compensated for their land and houses , and they should find a new area to live elsewhere . '' A man standing nearby echoed that view . `` Even if someone did n't do anything , his nephew or his cousin might have . Maybe 95 percent of people in Tawargha supported Gaddafi , '' he said . `` It 's better if they find somewhere else , far from Misrata .

Trading sources told Reuters that tanker Hellas Warrior , which loaded 381,000 barrels of Sarir and Mesla crude , was bought by Conoco for delivery to France 's Mediterranean port of Fos\\/Lavera , and one source said it was destined for Germany 's MIRO refinery . Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- Agoco -RRB- gave the cargo to Vitol in payment for oil product deliveries , and Vitol then sold it to Conoco , the sources said . U.S. companies were among the most active buyers of light and low-sulphur Libyan crude before the civil war and were the first to stop purchases after Washington and the European Union slapped sanctions on the government of now-ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi . Sanctions against Libya have been removed or eased about a month ago , but sources at U.S. firms have said it will take a few weeks before they can resume purchases of Libyan crude . `` We have done most of the work and are close to sorting out our internal problems to be able to buy again , '' said a source at a major U.S. firm other than Conoco . A source at Libya 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- confirmed that the transaction had taken place and said it expected to start dealing with U.S. oil firms directly in the near future . `` That deal was done through Agoco . We have some contacts with the United States and they tell us they can start buying again , '' he said . Agoco , a subsidiary of NOC , has been handling marketing operations in recent months because of international sanctions on the umbrella firm . The NOC source said that it would start marketing crude again by mid-October . Oil is slowly starting to flow again from Libya after seven months of fighting and , if fresh projections prove correct , may beat the expectations of analysts , who think it could take three years to reach pre-war output levels . Libyan oil industry is dominated by European players , although U.S. companies such as Conoco , Marathon , Hess and Occidental are also involved in a number of exploration and production projects in the country , the holder of Africa 's largest oil reserves . -LRB- Reporting by Emma Farge and Dmitry Zhdannikov , editing by Jane Baird -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "297", "dct": "2011-10-01", "dates": ["2011-10-01", "2011-10-01"], "text": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . Full Article Analysis - Libya endgame carries new risks for NATO BRUSSELS | Sat Oct 1 , 2011 12:29 am IST BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - NATO commanders face a tough balancing act during the bloody battle for Muammar Gaddafi 's last strongholds , Sirte and Bani Walid . NATO allies would like to let the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- claim victory in these battles and war for itself . That would enhance the council 's legitimacy as the new ruler of Libya after Gaddafi 's four decades in power , and bolster the chances of a stable democracy taking root in the country . But the European governments that led NATO 's air campaign in Libya also need to remain long enough and engaged enough to make sure the success so far is not diminished by a messy withdrawal . If NATO quietly stepped aside but fighting restarted , that would diminish Europe 's standing in Libya and tarnish a campaign that has been seen as a success for Europeans . To achieve this , experts say , NATO forces are keen to cut back the bombing campaign that was instrumental in giving the NTC a military edge . Instead , NATO will likely step up other operations such as surveillance and air support to eliminate any remaining weaponry that could threaten peaceful transition . NATO declines to comment on its immediate operations . `` As we approach the endgame , it is very clear NATO 's role will become very much the eyes and ears of the NTC , rather than the hammer , '' said Tim Ripley , a London-based military expert at Jane 's Defense Weekly . `` The next phase in Libya will amount to a more deliberate mopping up of the country as the NTC moves to establish their control and presence . '' One problem is that Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists are in Bani Walid and Sirte , which are densely populated . That makes it risky to try to bomb them because of the danger of civilian casualties . NATO , argues Shashank Joshi , an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London , lacks sufficient intelligence to allow it to pinpoint targets in Sirte and Bani Walid without endangering civilians . `` We are in a fortress situation where the city is under siege . If you do n't know that a particular building is being used as a school or a mosque , even the best intelligence wo n't give you the details , '' he said . `` In Tripoli , you had rebels , you had -LRB- Western -RRB- special forces , networks of resistance . We do n't have that kind of information in Sirte or Bani Walid . So targeting is inherently difficult . '' To a degree , battle conditions with Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists necessitate a change of operational approach because of the limitations of NATO jets ' firepower which is to dangerous to use , said Ripley of Jane 's Defense Weekly . `` Gaddafi forces are no longer using tanks and artillery that were easier to hit and identify . The NTC is using infantry to drive Gaddafi 's forces from building to building , '' Ripley said . `` Both sides are operating in such close proximity that differentiating between the sides is difficult . That makes it very difficult to use air-drop weapons -LRB- bombs -RRB- . '' Experts say other constraints also complicate NATO 's operations in Sirte and Bani Walid as its military commanders plan how to fulfill the alliance 's United Nations mandate in Libya to protect civilians during the civil war . So far , NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said , there are no confirmed cases of civilians being killed by NATO power , although alliance officials say some can not be ruled out . Human rights organizations have called on the alliance to lean on NTC fighters to do more to protect civilians as worries mount for people trapped in Sirte . Desperation is growing in the besieged city as civilians try to flee the battle , both sides are accusing each other of endangering civilians , and aid agencies say a humanitarian disaster is looming because of shrinking supplies of water , electricity and food . `` NATO has significant influence over the actions of -LRB- NTC -RRB- forces , '' said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch . `` And needs to use it to ensure that the NTC meet their legal obligation under international law -LRB- to avoid civilian casualties -RRB- , '' he said . Another challenge for NATO , Bouckaert added , was preventing NTC forces from taking action against civilians they suspect of siding with Gaddafi loyalists . `` It is essential that those civilian populations , even if they are pro-Gaddafi , do not suffer from vengeance , '' he said . NATO officials acknowledge difficulties they are facing in Gaddafi 's last strongholds but have given little indication of how much firepower the deposed leader has at his disposal , other than `` small logistical and mobility capabilities '' . `` Their actions are limited to tactical initiatives in isolated pockets , representing a fraction of Libya 's territory and population , '' said NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie . `` They do n't control many access routes within Libya . The mission is not yet over but the end is near , '' Focusing on Gaddafi loyalists ' access routes to supplies or way out of their strongholds might be an important part of NATO tactics in the near future , military experts said . `` A very big role NATO can play is to dominate the terrain , the roads outside of town , '' said Ripley . `` They can enforce the siege but they can not finish off Gaddafi forces . They can prevent them from rebuilding , replenishing or escaping . '' Already , NATO figures from recent days show the alliance 's targeting has focused on storage and command facilities and less on tanks and artillery assets . Outside of Sirte and Bani Walid , NATO forces will likely concentrate on hunting down any weaponry left behind by the Gaddafi regime , experts said . `` There is a lot of kit left in the country , '' said Douglas Barrie , a military aviation specialist at London 's International Institute of Strategic Studies . `` The bombing campaign did n't destroy all of the regime 's military capacity by any stretch of imagination . We did n't have enough aircraft , we did n't have enough time . `` I suppose the -LRB- NATO -RRB- thinking is they do n't want to leave any credible rump of military capabilities that could cause problems for the transitional council .

The birthplace of deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is one of two towns still holding out against the country 's new rulers . The fighting has entered its third week and civilians are caught up in a worsening humanitarian crisis . The interim government , the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , declared a two-day truce to allow civilians to escape , but people emerging from the city said they knew nothing of the ceasefire , and that the shooting had not stopped . `` Doctors start operating , then the power goes . They have a few litres of fuel for the generators , then the lights go out when they operate , '' said a man who gave his name as Al-Sadiq , who said he ran the dialysis unit at Sirte 's main hospital . `` I saw a child of 14 die on the operating table because the power went out during the operation , '' he told Reuters on the western outskirts of the city . Aid workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- who brought medical supplies into Sirte Saturday could not reach the hospital because of shooting . That hospital has now become the focus of concerns about the humanitarian crisis in the city . `` It 's a catastrophe . Patients are dying every day for need of oxygen , '' said Mohammed Shnaq , a biochemist at the hospital who fled early Sunday during a lull in the shooting . He said private pharmacies in Sirte had handed over their supplies to the hospital after its own stocks ran out a week ago , but these were now running out too . The ICRC said that it planned to go back into Sirte and hoped to reach the hospital , security permitting . `` We want to deliver oxygen , which is lacking at the hospital , '' ICRC spokesman Marcal Izard told Reuters in Geneva . `` But it has to be done carefully , oxygen is very delicate . A stray bullet would be a disaster . '' Colonel Hamed Al-Hasi , commander of the anti-Gaddafi Qatar brigade east of Sirte , said the truce had expired Sunday , but a full assault was still out of the question . `` There are still more than 15,000 persons inside . We can not sacrifice them , '' he said . He said NTC forces would for now instead be targeting the district of Bouhadi , just to the south of Sirte . He said a captured Gaddafi loyalist had told them that Mo'atassem , one of the deposed Libyan leader 's sons and his former national security adviser , was in the district . `` We 've been concentrating since last night on Bouhadi , '' he said . `` If we catch Mo'atassem , things will calm down . '' NATO warplanes were more in evidence than in previous days , with aircraft flying unusually low over the city . In one 10-minute period there was a steady rumble from bombs dropping on an area south of the city , a Reuters reporter said . Libyans ended Gaddafi 's 42-year rule in August when rebel fighters stormed the capital . Gaddafi and several of his sons are still at large , and his supporters hold Sirte and the town of Bani Walid , south of Tripoli . Gaddafi 's supporters are too weak to regain power , but their resistance is frustrating the new rulers ' efforts to start building the post-Gaddafi Libya . While it needs to stamp out the last resistance swiftly , the NTC does not want to use indiscriminate shelling , which could hurt its standing and make it even harder to govern Libya 's fractious tribes and regions . Gaddafi loyalists and some civilians have blamed NATO air strikes and shelling by anti-Gaddafi forces for the deaths of civilians in Sirte . Both NATO and the NTC deny that and say it is the Gaddafi loyalists who are endangering civilians by using them as human shields . Khalid Ahmed , who fled the city early Sunday , said the residential area where he lives in the center of Sirte had come under heavy artillery fire Saturday . `` The reason there is shooting in the city center is that the pro-Gaddafi militia has positioned artillery in the buildings where civilians live . The children are terrified and they are screaming all the time . '' He said he had been able to get out by borrowing money to buy black-market fuel . He said the rate in Sirte now was 600 dinars , or about $ 450 , for 20 litres of fuel . Doctors at a field hospital east of Sirte said four NTC fighters had been killed Sunday in `` friendly fire '' incidents -- testament to the often-chaotic conduct of the anti-Gaddafi forces . The focus on the battle for the last pro-Gaddafi strongholds -- and on tracking down Gaddafi himself -- has left a power vacuum in Tripoli . With no process in motion for electing a new leadership , power on the ground is wielded by anti-Gaddafi militias who are jockeying with each other for influence in the new Libya . Some analysts warn that this rivalry could turn violent . One commander in Tripoli said he was setting up an armed group to keep order in the city , even though that function is already carried out by a body led by Abdulhakim Belhadj , a former militant Islamist . `` Who is he ? Who appointed him ? '' said Abdullah Ahmed Naker , the head of the new group , when asked about Belhadj . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The quotes in the title might make someone take this the wrong way . Nato does n't seem to mind killing civilians who belong to tribes who wo n't succumb to it . The fall of Sirte was first reported 28\\/08\\/2011 by Haaretz . After that date a stream of reports stating that surrender of the Libyan Armes Forces -LRB- LAF -RRB- was imminent and giving totally contradictory distances of the `` advancing '' rebel forces which according to BBC 29\\/08\\/2011 were 18 miles from the city center -- this figure actually increased as the days went by . Over a month later the same reports of an imminenet rebel victory in Sirte from the media . Further , the repeated myth of only two cities still under Libyan Govt . control just does n't fit the facts . 80 % of the country remains under LAF control and the town of Ghadames has just been retaken by them . A counter offensive has been anounced by the LAF . Khamis Gaddafi has been reported dead at on at least 5 different occasions only to miraculously reappear sever days later idem Ibrahim Moussa . From the beginning of the civil war and intervention of Nato the rebels have been killing each other starting with the summary execution of the rebel General Younes . It is clear that : 1 -RRB- The majority of Libyans are against the CNT rebels and oppose the British , French and Qattari presence . 2 -RRB- Without Nato air support the civil war would have been over months ago and the rebels in prison . 3 -RRB- The CNT , even with the miliary support of NATO , is a disparate puppet group representing corporate and western interests and will be incapable of governing the country -- their leaders are already resigning or grasping for power . 4 -RRB- The inaccurate and selective reporting by the media of this civil war has directly contributed to British and French citizens accepting that their respective governments order the bombing of tens of thousands of ordinary Libyan citizens .

Waha Oil is owned by Libya 's National Oil Corporation in a joint venture with American firms ConocoPhillips , Marathon and Amerada Hess . Before the conflict , it pumped nearly half a million barrels of oil per day -LRB- 380,000 bpd -RRB- but it is now producing no crude . `` They -LRB- company managers -RRB- sent a group of engineers and they have gone around to see the damage , although they were not able to make it to all locations as some are still dangerous because Gaddafi 's troops are still there , '' said Abdullatif Hetwash , an engineer who has worked for Waha Oil for 36 years . Waha operates four main oil fields , including Waha , Dahra , Samah and has its main base at the Es-sider terminal on Libya 's Mediterranean coast . `` Waha is not safe yet , Samah is not safe yet , but they managed to visit Gialo and reported that everything , the warehouse , facilities , accommodation , has all been destroyed by Gaddafi 's troops . They went in and they destroyed the equipment and have taken most of the spare parts , '' he said . `` In one raid they took 127 trucks from Es-sider terminal and one of our transport managers gave up to Gaddafi 's troops 60 new Land Rovers . We have the report . He was pro-Gaddafi . '' Most of Libya is nominally under the control of the new interim government , but security provision is patchy and fighting is still going on at Sirte , on the Mediterranean coast , and at Bani Walid , south-east of Tripoli . Just weeks ago , 17 people were killed in a raid by militia at Ras Lanuf , Libya 's largest refinery . `` There 's no security , no electricity , no food and looting at the warehouses , '' said Hetwash . `` In some areas 90 percent of spare parts and motors have been destroyed , and we can not start production until they are replaced because it is dangerous , '' he added . It could take six months to restore the facilities at the fields seen by the Waha Oil team , Hetwash said , and the restart is being held up by key workers who say they will not return to the fields until managers , seen as remnants of Gaddafi 's regime , agree to step down . He said if the internal dispute is resolved , engineers and other workers are ready to start the work of getting Waha Oil 's fields back on stream . `` Most of the people that produce the oil are here . We can do without them , the managers . We can start from tomorrow if we can have enough transport , equipment , tools and materials , '' Hetwash said . Along with hundreds of Waha Oil employees , Hetwash was at a rally on Sunday outside the company 's headquarters to demand a change of management . The protest reflected the freedom that Libyans are now enjoying after Gaddafi 's autocratic rule came to an end , and the grievances that built up for decades . Before , security forces would stop any public show of dissent . `` The chairman and members must go immediately , and not wait another minute , '' said Widad El Said , a secretary at the company for four years . `` Everything has stopped for eight months and this is not good for Libya . But all the employees in the fields have refused to go back because they will never trust the management again '' she said . In August , Marathon Oil said it has had preliminary discussions with the interim government , the National Transitional Council , on restarting output at the Waha field . But the firm said it would n't send staff back to Libya until it could ensure their safety . -LRB- Editing by Christian Lowe and Jane Merriman -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "225", "dct": "2011-10-05", "dates": ["2011-10-05", "2011-10-04", "2011-10-05", "2011-10-04", "2011-10-04", "2011-10-01", "2011-10-04"], "text": "TRIPOLI Oct 5 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's National Oil Company -LRB- NOC -RRB- denied that any new deal involving Libyan oil has been struck with Britain 's Heritage Oil , highlighting the risks of doing business at a time when fighting continues in parts of the country . Heritage said on Tuesday it bought 51 percent of Benghazi-based Sahara Oil Services Holdings for $ 19.5 million . But NOC 's director of international cooperation , Ahmed Al-Taghdi , told Reuters on Wednesday it was too early to consider any new deals involving Libyan oil companies . `` I have been instructed to deny these reports , '' Al-Taghdi said in an interview . The British company insisted a deal had been agreed upon and said approval from the Libyan state oil company was not required . `` Heritage is reiterating what it said yesterday , which is that it has not signed a deal with the NOC , it has merely acquired a stake in a support services firm , '' a spokesman for Heritage said . `` It is not something the NOC has to go through a subsequent approval process on . '' Al-Taghdi said Tuesday 's reports were incorrect and that no new deal involving services or production had been authorised . The following statement later appeared on NOC 's website : `` The National Oil Corporation denies the existence of any talks with British firm Heritage to reach an agreement on re-upgrading some oilfields , starting production and awarding privileges . '' Libya 's oil sector is in flux as the country begins to emerge from more than six months of civil war . Fighting continues to sever Tripoli from the east of the country , and the oil sector faces an imminent reshuffle under the new government . NOC subsidiaries have called for independence from the state oil body , with Total 's Libyan venture calling for the all-powerful NOC to be dismantled and assume the role of regulator and Benghazi-based Agoco tendering cargoes for delivery later this month . Britain has moved fast to win the favor of Libya 's new government in the hope it will help its firms gain access to the North African country 's oil reserves . Cash-rich Heritage has a long history in Africa and a reputation for being a first-mover into political hotspots . The relatively small outlay for the British company dwarfs the potential returns from securing new deals . Others eyeing a quick return to Libya 's oil business may be deterred by the development , in a country where the political landscape is still highly fluid and the organization of the oil sector itself is uncertain . The NOC said at the start of the week it would resume full control over the oil business in Libya within the month , but there have been calls from its oil producing subsidiaries for more autonomy . There are signs Agoco is enjoying its independence after playing a crucial role in supporting the NTC during the height of the conflict . Heritage said on Tuesday it had discussed its deal with members of the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- which has yet to appoint a separate oil minister and plans to fully hand back responsibility for the oil sector to the all-powerful NOC .

Much will depend on the damage done to infrastructure and equipment in the last stages of the fighting between forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his 41 years of rule . Analysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition is riven by internal division , which could prompt new fighting after Gaddafi has been removed from power , jeopardizing both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . War and other traumas in oil producing nations have typically had a lasting impact on output . The speed of recovery in oil output depends crucially on how quickly international companies with highly evolved skills can be brought in . Following are details of Libya 's oil industry , production and assessments of how long it may take to restore output . \\* Until the beginning of this year , OPEC member Libya was the world 's 17th-largest oil producer and Africa 's third-largest . It holds the continent 's largest crude oil reserves . It sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe . \\* Oil production was equivalent to about 2 percent of global consumption , but fighting and social disruption have cut this to less than 100,000 bpd . Many oilfields are dependent on foreign workers , who have almost all left the country . \\* Most of Libya 's oilfields are around the Sirte Basin , which contains around 80 percent of its proven reserves and spans the front line between rebel and government forces . \\* Libya has six major oil export terminals , listed with loading volumes for January from the IEA . Further details are emerging about the condition of these facilities : - Es Sider -LRB- 447,000 bpd -RRB- : Libya 's biggest oil terminal may take more than a year to be fully repaired , according to the head of National Oil Corp Nouri Berouin . - Marsa El Brega -LRB- 51,000 bpd -RRB- : Rebels said in August the only damage at Brega was an oil storage tank on fire . - Ras Lanuf -LRB- 195,000 bpd -RRB- - The refinery remained out of service by October 3 and would not restart until oil output had climbed to 500,000 bpd within two months , Berouin said . Rebels said in August the oil facilities at the port had not suffered any damages . - Tobruk -LRB- 51,000 bpd -RRB- : Fully operational currently , according to Berouin . - Zueitina -LRB- 214,000 bpd -RRB- : Fully operational currently , according to Berouin . - Zawiyah -LRB- 199,000 bpd -RRB- : Operations at the refinery are resuming and are at half output , according to Berouin . - other unspecified terminals -LRB- 333,000 bpd -RRB- \\* Libya has five domestic refineries with a total crude distillation capacity of 378,000 bpd : Azzawiya Oil Refining Co -LRB- 120,000 bpd -RRB- , Sarir Refining -LRB- 10,000 bpd -RRB- , Sirte Oil Co -LRB- 8,000 bpd -RRB- , Tobruk Refining -LRB- 20,000 bpd -RRB- and Ras Lanuf Oil & Gas Processing Co -LRB- 220,000 bpd -RRB- . \\* Reuters calculations show that 130,000 barrels per day of refining capacity is now onstream - a figure that will likely rise to 230,000 bpd once the Zawiyah refinery reaches full output and could rise to 300,000 bpd by year-end if the Ras Lanuf plant restarts . \\* Al Jurf : the offshore Total-run 45,000 bpd field was in the process of restarting in September , according to Berouin . \\* El Sharara : Berouin said the larger 200,000 bpd Repsol-operated field , deep in the western desert , would begin pumping soon . \\* ENI fears that its part-owned 130,000 barrels-per-day Elephant field , its largest in the country , may be in ruins with its airport destroyed along with key electronic structures . \\* A source puts the combined output of Sharara and Elephant fields at 450,000 bpd , but the NOC 's Berouin said current production stood at 350,000 bpd . \\* Production on ENI 's Abu Attifel field restarted in September , with production reaching 70,000 barrels per day in early October ; production at Wafa is also restarted . \\* The Bouri field will restart production of both oil and gas by the end of the month . \\* AGOCO 's eastern fields of Sarir and Mesla are currently pumping , with traders noting that the first cargo of crude to ship to Asia from Libya was probably Sarir . \\* Hamada : Smaller fields like the 15,000 bpd Hamada field will resume production within days , Berouin said , while Nafoora was due to restart on October 5 and Beda on the 15 . \\* Waha Oil 's Waha and Samah fields are currently not safe , while Gialo suffered a great degree of damage , according to company officials . \\* No information has yet emerged on the state of fields such as Dahra , Nasser or Raguba , Beida or Intisar among others . \\* In September , two cargoes of crude oil were exported for Tesoro and Conoco refineries and a third one was sent to Zawiyah refinery for domestic needs , easing the cost of purchasing fuel on the spot market . \\* `` Some of the oil is going to internal refiners so it will still be a while before we see a real push on exports , '' said Olivier Jakob , analyst at Petromatrix . \\* A third cargo of condensate , sold to Austrian oil and gas company OMV in early October , was deliveried to the Italian port of Trieste loaded from storage tanks filled prior to the war , Berouin said . \\* The same month , European trading company Gunvor booked oil tanker Wilmina to load 950,000 barrels of Libyan crude , according to shipping fixtures . The destination was given as east of Suez , which traders said meant it was likely heading to China . \\* A Reuters poll of 20 analysts and industry officials in July forecast it would take up to one year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd but up to two years to get back to pre-civil war levels of 1.6 million bpd . \\* The chairman of the NOC Nouir Berouin reiterated that it could take up to 15 months for output to return to pre-war levels , although many analysts have been surprised by the speed with which operations have resumed . \\* Consultants Petroleum Policy Intelligence estimated that output could reach 1 million bpd by the end of November . \\* FACTS Energy analysts expects Libyan crude production to rise to 800,000 bpd by the end of this year and to return to the pre-crisis level of 1.6 million bpd by end-2012 . \\* Oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it would take around 36 months for the country to recover its full production capacity , from whenever the crisis is resolved . It estimates that substantial oil volumes could be back in the market by late 2012 if a resolution is achieved by the end of 2011 . But the recovery period will extend if production remains shut-in for longer , as infrastructure continues to deteriorate . \\* Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East & North Africa energy analyst with IHS Energy , said oil output could theoretically be restored in 18 months but that this would be the most optimistic scenario . \\* `` The ramp-up stage -LRB- of oil production -RRB- is where quick decision-making will be needed most and where the recovery could be derailed from the very good pace at which is has initially picked up , '' said Ciszuk . `` We said from the beginning the main challenge might be the ramp-up , rather than the re-start so most of that is still to be seen . '' \\* In August , the longest forecast for a full recovery of oil output came from David Wech , head of research at Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy . He said a return to full output capacity could take three to four years because significant investment in infrastructure would be necessary . \\* Libya 's oil industry was formerly run by the state National Oil Co , which accounted for around 50 percent of the country 's output . \\* The NOC plans to resume marketing within the next month , although some subsidiaries have expressed resistance to the idea of an all-powerful NOC . The future division of responsibilities between the NOC and the oil and finance ministry , headed by Ali Tarhouni , is unclear . Earlier plans to form a separate oil ministry for shaping policy appear to be floundering . \\* Foreign oil firms , essential for the quick resumption of production , have spoken to rebels at length , but the future of existing contracts with Gaddafi 's government is uncertain . \\* Italian producer ENI , present in Libya since the 1950s , is the biggest foreign oil company there , producing 270,000 boed -LRB- barrels of oil equivalent per day -RRB- in 2010 . Its contracts are in force to 2042 for oil production , but it is not yet clear if they would be honored by any future government . \\* The total equity share of the following foreign companies -- many of which operated fields on behalf of Libya 's National Oil Co -- amounted to almost 500,000 bpd before the conflict began . The legal status of contracts after the civil war will need to be clarified .

SIRTE , Libya | Sun Oct 9 , 2011 12:41 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan transitional government forces said on Sunday they had captured landmark buildings in a thrust towards the center of Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown Sirte , but were holding off an assault on its main square to allow civilians to escape the chaotic fighting . Taking Sirte would bring Libya 's new rulers a big step closer to establishing control of the entire , sprawling North African country almost two months after they seized the capital Tripoli , but pro-Gaddafi snipers have slowed their advance . `` We have made good progress , '' said Mahmoud Bayu , commander of the Shohada Al-Manatair brigade , to the south of Sirte . `` We have entered the Ouagadougou -LRB- conference -RRB- center , there is some fighting going on , but it 's under our control . '' National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- forces also wrested control of the main hospital , a Reuters witness said , capturing more than a dozen pro-Gaddafi fighters who had used the complex to fire mortars and rocket-propelled grenades . `` We are trying to evacuate the sick and wounded , '' said Salah Mustafa , a commander of the government forces . `` Most of the Gaddafi militia fled , some of them have disguised themselves as doctors . We have to investigate . '' Some 15 Gaddafi loyalists were marched out of the hospital premises and one was punched in the back of the head when NTC forces found a picture of the deposed leader in his pocket . Bayu said NTC forces had reached the main square of the Mediterranean coastal city of 75,000 people , but could not move in yet as they were waiting for civilians to leave the area . A further important target for the new advance on Sirte , the university , had been seized overnight , NTC forces in the east of the city said , but they came under heavy fire there on Sunday morning and some fighters had fallen back . `` Last night , we were sleeping in the university and this morning we came under random strikes there , '' said a fighter who had withdrawn from the position . `` We have martyrs -LRB- dead -RRB- inside and we are trying to get them out . '' Two bodies lay in a nearby field hospital , one with his face blown off . They had been hit by fire from an anti-aircraft gun while trying to evacuate patients from a frontline hospital , their comrades said . Lines of pick-up trucks mounted with heavy weaponry waited to move up to take on a sniper who was slowing their advance . The prolonged struggle to vanquish Sirte and the other few remaining bastions of pro-Gaddafi loyalists has sidetracked NTC efforts to set up effective government over the sprawling North African country and rebuild oil production vital to its economy . Sirte holds symbolic significance because Gaddafi , who ruled for 42 years , turned it from a fishing village into a second capital . He built opulent villas , hotels and conference halls to house the international summits he liked to stage there . But taking Sirte carries risks for Libya 's new rulers . A drawn-out battle with many civilian casualties will breed hostility that will make it very difficult for the NTC to unite the country once the fighting is over . Thousands of civilians have fled Sirte as fighting has intensified , describing increasingly desperate conditions for those still inside the seafront city . There is no electricity while drinking water and food are running out , and there is the stench of rotting corpses at the city 's hospital . But Britain 's defense secretary told Reuters that NATO , which has carried out air strikes effectively on behalf of anti-Gaddafi forces over much of Libya 's civil war , had stayed within its U.N. mandate to protect civilians during the siege of Sirte . `` NATO has been extraordinarily careful in target selection .

The protracted battle for Sirte has raised concerns that civilian casualties could breed long-term hostility and make it hard for the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- to unite the vast North African state once the fighting is over . `` Gaddafi 's forces are cornered in two neighborhoods near the sea , an area of about 2-km square , but there is still resistance , '' Abdul Salam Javallah , commander of NTC units from eastern Libya , told Reuters on the front line of their attack . `` We are dealing with them now with light weapons because there are still families inside , '' he said . Shortly after he spoke , a group of three women , three small children and two male civilians emerged from a house on the front line . They were searched by the rebels and hurriedly got into a car and drove off waving the V-for-victory sign . Another family of three women and one man , stopping at a checkpoint as they fled Sirte , said they had been trapped in their house by the fighting . `` We did n't know where the strikes were coming from . Everyone is being hit all day and all night . There is no electricity and no water . There is not one neighborhood that has n't been hit , '' said one of the women who gave her name as Umm Ismail . NTC commanders say they are using only light weapons , but government tanks have also moved into road intersections and pounded Gaddafi positions , while pick-up trucks mounted with heavy weapons as well as foot soldiers darted out of cover to fire wildly up ahead . At times , NTC units came under fire from their own side , a hazard becoming more acute as the poorly coordinated groups of government volunteers attacking from the east and west close in on one another . Most of the NTC forces attacking Sirte are from other towns and do not have much help from the inside as they did they when they captured the capital Tripoli on August 23 and ended 42 years of one-man rule by Gaddafi after six months of civil war . GADDAFI 'S MEN FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES Many civilians from Sirte are also fighting alongside the remnants of Gaddafi 's army in the belief the outsiders will commit atrocities once they capture the city of 75,000 people , which Gaddafi built into a lavish second capital . `` Gaddafi 's troops know their way around , '' said one government fighter in a brief lull in the fighting . `` We do n't know the city . We do n't even know what 's in the next street . '' Gaddafi is believed to be hiding in the desert to the south . NTC forces have struggled to take Sirte and a few other bastions of Gaddafi loyalists , which has impeded efforts to set up effective government nationwide and restart oil production , the lifeblood of the Libyan economy . Several Libyan analysts also say they are worried fault lines are opening up between the Islamist-run Tripoli Military Council , which has nominal control over the capital and is also believed to be backed by Qatar , and groups loyal to interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril , a Western-trained technocrat . The interim government sent out text messages on Monday urging their fighters to report to military bases and join the national army . Concern is rising in the capital about potential conflict among armed groups that converged on Tripoli in August and have stayed on to demand stakes in a future government . NTC forces in Sirte took three important landmark buildings on Sunday -- the main hospital , the university and the opulent Ouagadougou conference center , built to host the summits of foreign dignitaries that Gaddafi was fond of staging . `` Eighty percent of Sirte is now under our control , '' said Omar Abu Lifa , a commander of government forces attacking Sirte from the west . NTC forces have repeatedly claimed to be on the point of victory in Sirte , only to suffer sudden reversals at the hands of tenacious enemies fighting for their lives , surrounded on three sides and with their backs to the sea . In just one field hospital to the east of the city , doctors said they had received 20 dead and 87 wounded over the last two days from fighting . There were many more casualties elsewhere . One man , a student , who had escaped from the center of the city , said he had watched from a rooftop on Sunday as Gaddafi soldiers destroyed 10 government pick-up trucks . `` Their morale is very high , '' said Salam Awad . `` They are prepared to fight to the death . '' NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil said his men had reached Sirte city center , while the only other major town in the hands of Gaddafi loyalists , Bani Walid in the interior desert to the south , was also under siege from no fewer than five sides . `` I think and I hope , with the help of God , the liberation of these two towns will be completed by the end of this week . God willing , '' he told a news conference in Tripoli on Sunday . Sirte holds symbolic significance because Gaddafi turned it from a fishing village into a second capital . He built opulent villas , hotels and conference halls to house the international summits he liked to stage there . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It would serve you well if that was made more clear in your headlines . You tend to do the same thing with the Syrian conflict . Reuters should be above being the mouthpiece for the U.S. State Dept. . The reports by the Mass Media , as someone rightly said , is largely based on reports from the NTC . We hear reports like , the last bastions of Gadhafi Loyalists . So many reports that made it to press have turned out to be false . One would think , after being fed with outright lies , many times , in the past , the Media will employ due diligence before running to their blogs to post lies . I guess the Media , NATO and the NTC are fingers of the same hand . They complement one another . For those that do n't know , Jamahiriyas , the tribal Councils , and not the NTC , control 80 % of Libyan cities . They were fast to hoist the banner of ` mission accomplished ' on taking Tripoli . The Media , in their culpability , reported to readers as if the war in Libya had been won by the Rebels . To-day , NATO is still bombing ferociously . I guess their mission is far from been accomplished . To anonymot : Reuters is a fantastic news outlet . They are not a `` mouthpiece '' for anyone . And to comment on Reuters when the FORMER regime has n't sputtered a word of truth in 42 years ! You appear to be a troll but we can spot you a mile away .

The coastal country has all the makings for a vibrant tourism business , they say : warm weather , beaches , antiquities and proximity to Europe -- all factors that helped the industry thrive in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia . If developed , tourism could eventually help dent Libya 's high jobless rate by creating work for tour guides , drivers , restaurant workers and hotel staff , as well as help it diversify its economy away from dependency on oil and gas . The fact that operators are thinking about resuming business at all -- some predicted tourists would start arriving again within a year -- testifies to the relative peace that has prevailed in Tripoli and other parts of Libya since the former rebels ousted Muammar Gaddafi 's forces from the capital in August . One company , Sherwes Travel , already advertises a three-day , 295-euro tour of `` post-war Libya '' on its website , featuring visits to sites in Tripoli and to the Roman ruins of Leptis Magna . Employees admit it may be a bit optimistic . `` The tour was very popular , actually . But not now , not yet , '' said Ibrahim Usta , the company 's self-described international customer assistant . He said while some potential visitors had been in touch , it was not yet possible to bring them to Libya . `` We have many inquiries right now , but the problem is mainly security and visas , '' he said . `` There 's no -LRB- visa -RRB- system in place and many embassies are not functioning . '' Usta and others said tourism was languishing before the revolt because of apathy , incompetence , complex visa requirements , draconian police oversight and mercurial regulations under Gaddafi 's government . Sabri Ellotai , manager of Sabri Tours and Travel , described bringing a group of Germans in 2009 only to have them turned away at the airport because they did not have an Arabic translation for their passports -- a requirement he had never heard of before . `` I heard about it -LRB- the law -RRB- at the airport , '' Ellotai said , shaking his head . He and others said they hoped the country 's new rulers -- currently represented by the interim National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- -- would be able to do more with the industry when the war is over . NTC forces are still fighting to take over Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte and a few other bastions of Gaddafi loyalists , which has impeded efforts to set up effective government nationwide and restart oil production . Libya 's lucrative oil and gas industry made tourism less of a priority than in Egypt and Tunisia , where it was a major contributor of jobs and foreign revenues before the uprisings in those countries . Libyan central bank official Ali Shnebesh estimated tourism could account for between 3 and 4 percent of the economy within five to ten years , depending on how much effort the country 's new government puts into it . `` It would decrease unemployment , since we have a lot of areas that are good for tourism , '' he said . `` It would put thousands of our people to work in these places in many sectors -- telecommunications , transportation , hotels -- everywhere . '' It is difficult to tell how much tourism contributed to Libya 's economy before the revolt because it was not tracked as a separate industry in central bank records , but Shnebesh estimated it was below half a percent of gross domestic product . That compares to Egypt , for instance , where officials said it accounted for over 11 percent before the revolt . There is plenty of evidence of the lax oversight at the ancient Greek colony of Cyrene , which was featured in the chronicler Herodotus 's `` The Histories '' and is now a UNESCO world heritage site , in the eastern Jebel al-Akhdar region . The site is overgrown with weeds and graffiti etched onto one of its old columns . A renovation crew of Italians , Americans and French fled after the uprising started , guards there said . Jamal Salem , 50 , sitting in the afternoon sun outside a souvenir shop filled with woven baskets , photographs and ceramic statues still on display , said there were n't many visitors even before the revolt . `` A lot of people think Libyans are terrorists , and so they 're afraid of coming here , '' he said . `` We hope the picture will become clearer now , and that things will get better . '' Others lingering in the area of Cyrene said they also hoped the revolt would help stamp out what they saw as widespread corruption and regional favouritism in the industry . `` Before , companies had their headquarters in Tripoli . They brought the cars from Tripoli , they brought the translators from Tripoli , everything . Nobody here benefited from it at all , '' Hussein Saleh , who volunteered to help guard Cyrene , said . Others near Cyrene and other sites said they also hoped a new government would show more interest in preserving relics . `` We 're expecting a better future , and maybe more interest in renovating the antiquities , '' said Muftah Mabrook , a 35-year-old researcher at the ancient Greek port of Apollonia , a picturesque collection of columns and other ruins set against the sea . While such ambitions are running high , it 's too soon to say how the situation will turn out . Tripoli 's atmospheric old city is slowly coming back to life as jewelry shops and cafes reopen up in its winding streets , for instance , but many alleys are still littered with bullet casings . In some areas , young men with Kalashnikov assault rifles sit smoking and chatting on stoops or around street corners . They are friendly , for the most part , as they smile and wave at foreign passersby , but their presence is not likely to encourage most holidaymakers . The relative lack of English and French language speakers , as well as the ban on alcohol , may also make it hard for Libya to compete on a large scale with Egypt and Tunisia even after the war is finished , some operators say . But Usta , like many others , was confident the industry would eventually thrive . `` We have everything . We have the desert , we have the sea , we have mountains . We just need the right people in the right place .

NATO has been extraordinarily careful in target selection . NATO has been very careful to minimize civilian casualties . NATO has stayed within its mandate throughout . It s a mantra that NATO , and the countries that have contributed to its Libyan adventure , have had to learn well . They ve been accused of stretching the legality of the mission to protect civilians by all necessary measures before . But the problem with sticking to a script , is that the Libyan conflict hasn t really progressed with any sort of predictable narrative since the fall of Tripoli on the night of August 23rd . If the then rebels of the now ruling National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- expected that internal insurrections would help them and they d race into Gaddafi s hometown of Sirte and the other remaining holdout , Bani Walid , to a hero s welcome , they were mistaken . Sirte and Bani Walid were not Tripoli . They resisted -- and resisted ferociously . Taken aback , fighters loyal to the NTC began drawn-out sieges of both towns , battering them with rockets , mortars and tanks as Gaddafi loyalists hit them with intense sniper and rocket fire . And all the while , the NTC men were backed by NATO warplanes . Now it s not only the usual critics saying that NATO has overstepped the mark . It s terrified Libyans fleeing Sirte with tales of dead relatives , weeks of little food and houses demolished by rockets . `` What did America and NATO bring to us ? Did they bring apricots ? '' one man shouted at a Reuters journalist in Sirte last week . `` No , they brought us the shelling and the strikes . They terrorised our kids . It s war , some officials say privately . It s always messy towards the end . But civilian deaths have been kept to a minimum and the country s infrastructure has been left largely intact , giving the economy a chance to get moving quickly . They could have surrendered , NTC commanders point out . NATO says that remnants of the Gaddafi regime pose a threat to civilians and it will support NTC operations for as long as that threat remains . They say Gaddafi loyalists in Sirte had kept people there as human shields and executed anti-Gaddafi residents stories echoed by some fleeing the city . For NATO s detractors , it s hard to see how launching airstrikes on a city already under heavy shelling from the NTC and with no power and little food amounted to protecting the people who lived in it . Liam Fox was sure where the blame for the suffering lay . There wouldn t be any NATO strikes if it had not been for the fact that Gaddafi was threatening his own population and threatening a civilian , humanitarian catastrophe in Benghazi , '' he told me , adding that the people of Sirte may need to be given some information on why the siege played out as it did . The risk now is that a people embittered by weeks of misery and the deaths of their friends may turn on the young government , making it difficult to stabilise the country and get it properly running again . Also , it seems true that many of them are sorry to see Gaddafi go some because of tribal allegiances , some because their city benefitted from his position and some simply because they admired him . One loyalist captured at the hospital in Sirte kept a photo of the ousted leader in his pocket . For NATO , the worst-case scenario risks turning an operation it heralds a success , into an embarrassment . It was more than I expected , I heard Fox say to his NTC hosts over lunch in Misrata , referring to the wreckage wrought by Gaddafi s merciless bombardment of that city after it was taken by the NTC . The pictures emerging from Sirte as it enters endgame suggest its devastation will be similar . What that will mean is the question . No , NATO 's strikes were not justified . NATO violated its own mission to protect civilians when it took sides : some civilians were worth protecting , others such as Gaddafi supporters were bombed . There are plenty of anecdotal reports from Sirte about the adverse consequences of NATO 's bombing for civilians . Moreover , NATO should have remained impartial rather than taken sides . It 's support for the rebels translates into support for the rebels ' documented war crimes against black Africans , including fellow Libyans , and suspected `` loyalists '' . Europe and the US have betrayed all principle in their greed for oil . My heart goes out to those who have had to pay the price , like the 3 year old in the bombed and shelled Sirte hospital with two broken legs and a damaged eye . I had thought that Europeans had given up war as a means to solve conflicts ; looks like they have not given up war when it is waged against the countries of the South . NATO should be prosecuted for the war crimes it has committed as should the so called rebels it used as on the ground proxies for European soldiers . This is not an `` embarrassment '' ; it is carnage and destruction of infrastructure , people 's houses , hospitals , schools ; NATO should foot the bill for reconstruction and pay reparations to those families affected . Right now its priority should be getting black Africans out of jail and making sure that prisoners are not being tortured , raped , abused , dehumanized . The NATO mission in Libya makes a mockery of the `` civilization '' that the heirs of the Enlightenment claim to represent . The civilized do not maim , hurt , kill small children . Dear Mr. Malone : thanks for posting this story . There is little in the press on this topic . I am sure that Mr Liam Fox would love to see his own house pulverised as long `` it is justified . '' Equally , smart media fabrications have also concluded that the Bombing of London , Desden , Nagasaki and Hiroshima `` had been justified ' because `` it had saved lives '' . NATO 's intervention in Libya is without a doubt a fiasco . No one understands how this military alliance meant to defend Europe against Soviets came to mingle into Libyan internal affairs . Hey , why do n't we send NATO forces to to Mexico to fight the war on drugs -- a trade we defend in Afghanistan ? Has NATO has stayed within its mandate ? NATO has no mandate . NATO was n't mentioned in UNSC R 1970 or 1973 . The entire war has been fashioned out of thin air , with considerable assistance from mainstream media including Reuters . It 's illegal , murderous and utterly evil . Participation in this unprovoked act of aggression against a sovereign nation is a war crime if the term has any meaning any more . Whats going on there is completely a mockery of NATO 's mandate shelling a city indiscriminately like we are seeing NTC & NATO do is immoral and borders on crimes against humanity ... looking at sirte the city is ruin for a month now the siege has yet to bear any fruits the humanitarian crisis is at its peak how is NATO protecting civilian if they are contributing to the mass killing of Gaddafi supporters . someone said when hunting for a beast be very careful not to turn into one . . I think in this case its too late . the NATO bombings were absolutely justified . Yes it is a tragedy for the people whose houses are being bombed because they harbor pro-gaddafi fighters but that is the nature of war . Does n't anyone recall when gaddafi shot and killed hundreds of protesters just because they were protesting ? i bet the people who were getting shot at then are pretty damn glad that NATO intervened . NATO has been hitting military targets . there are no huge dumb bombs being dropped all over cities , just precision airstrikes . in my opinion its better to get this whole ugly war business over as quickly as possible . without NATO assistance , there would be a long drawn out civil war . Remember the American civil war ? i bet if France or England or someone had helped out one side then thousands and thousands of lives could have been saved . I guess the main point is that people is a necessary evil of war , its a dirty business , all that can be done is to minimize the carnage . The Libyan people do n't want to kill civilians as much if not more than we -LRB- NATO -RRB- does . Eventually everyone has to be reintegrated under whatever regime pops us at the end of this mess . Obviously we 're sitting on the wrong side of the fence . NATO is a pawn of U.S. and west , consequently U.N. was useless in trying to tie their hands . With over 50,000 casualties and total devastation of some cities , did NATO really `` protect '' civilians or protect NTC rebels who were a ` rag-tag '' army that could n't stand vs Gaddaffi 's troops . Oil is the name of the game an d Western allies will be lining up for reconstruction projects paid for in `` black gold . '' Neat world we live in , eh ? Posted by tod | Report as abusive I just do n't understand how these rebels have some of the updated weapons in their hands when these political leaders are crying out loud that they are fighting the terrorism . Just like in Irak , this end will be very sad ... NATO is always looking for a fight , and Libya episode is a shame to the western uncivilized attitude . This will hunt them for generation to come . Must have been an incredibly slow news day . Ask the same questions for months . Get the same answers . Try and make that a story . Nato in Libya equals oil for Nato countries and their war planes . No oil in Zimbawia so Mugabee you are safe . Nice one Nato this means I can still fuel my gas guzzling SUV brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrum . What country can we topple nest for oil as Libyas wont last for ever . Im serious , at least I speak the truth ! Lets cut all the nonsense of NATO mission to protect civilians . This was NATO 's mission to assassinate Gadaffi and thats exactly what they did plain and simple . Muammar al-Qaddhafi was a murderer and a pillager . As such , he -- and all who helped him -LRB- actively and passively -RRB- -- were fair game . Al-Qaddhafi viewed other Libyans as his `` property '' , with whom he could do as he pleased . Al-Qaddhafi chose to `` hole up '' in Sirte , rather than to surrender . He could have taken refuge at a military base , where civilians would not be at risk from the inevitable shoot-out . While some in Sirte likely did not back al-Qaddhafi , the destruction they suffered will be a long-lasting lesson . Those , who do not stand up to a dictator , may be swept away with him . The horrendous destruction inflicted on Germany during World War II , to this moves Germans to reject political extremists . Indeed , a specific unit of the German government -- the Bundesamtes f r Verfassungsschutz -LRB- Federal Office for Protection of the Constitution -RRB- -- watches all extremists carefully . Those , who defend al-Qaddhafi -- or criticise NATO for having helped Libyans to oust him -- embrace al-Qaddhafi 's approach : murder and pillage . Libyans will benefit from his decision to fight to the end . That fight thinned the ranks of democracy-haters . Had al-Qaddhafi surrendered quietly , thousands of his henchmen would have survived , to poison Libya for many more years . Further , during their months-long fight for freedom , many Libyans acquired skills with firearms , e.g. , battle rifles , pistols , shotguns , etc. . I pray they 'll be smart enough not to surrender these to anyone . While explosives -LRB- artillery shells , grenades , missiles , etc. -RRB- are dangerous , especially if stored badly , firearms -- if securely stored -- are quite safe . Because Libyans lacked weapons and the skills to use them , they had to have help to oust al-Qaddhafi and his accomplices . If Libyans are to remain free , they must remain armed . Those , who urge Libyans to disarm , simply can not grasp that dictators flourish , when their victims are disarmed . As to Mugabe , South Africa should deal with him . It bespeaks South Africa 's insensitivity to Zimbabweans ' sufferings , that they have not ousted Mugabe . It is ironic , that South Africans , who got much foreign help to free themselves from Apartheid tyrants , will not reach out to help neighbors , who groan under Mugabe 's pillaging . Those , who provide that , deserve our praise , for they liberate the oppressed . `` Were NATO strikes on Gaddafi s home town justified ? '' Unless Sirte was prepared to be starved into submission to protect Gadaffi 's miserable skin , and the moralisers willing to watch . The revolutionary forces pleaded on behalf of the residents of Sirte with Gadaffi 's frontmen for months , but they made almost no concessions to the general welfare . Gadaffi 's neck was more valuable . After that , the sooner it ended the more lives were saved . As for the bombing itself , the details are far from clear . Much o9f the so-called ` residential ' areas struck were in fact either evacuated or not even finished . And the attack on Sima hospital is a legal minefield for Gadaffi aplogists , since his forces were installed within , making it a military target .

National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- commanders moved up tanks to fire at buildings from close range to try to dislodge the remaining Gaddafi snipers who are now surrounded on all sides in one small part of the city . `` We have control of the whole of the city except neighborhood ` Number Two ' where the Gaddafi forces are surrounded , '' said Khaled Alteir , a field commander in Sirte . `` This operation is on its dying breath , '' said another commander , Colonel Mohammad Aghfeer .

Efforts to extinguish resistance in Sirte received a big boost on Wednesday when , NTC officials said , government forces captured Gaddafi 's son Mo ` tassim , a former national security adviser , as he tried to escape the battle-torn city . `` He was arrested today in Sirte , '' the head of the Tripoli Revolutionary Council , Colonel Abdullah Naker , told Reuters . Other NTC officials in Benghazi confirmed Mo ` tassim had been captured and said he was taken to a military base in the eastern city , but the council has yet to make an official confirmation , or denial of the reports . Mo ` tassim would be the first member of the Gaddafi family to fall into the hands of the new government that emerged after six months of civil war . Gaddafi himself is believed to be hiding somewhere in Libya 's vast desert in the south of the country . Die-hard loyalists to the deposed leader have not given up the fight , answering NTC attacks in Sirte with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades . An NTC commander said Gaddafi 's besieged forces were no longer using heavier weapons . Green flags , the banner of Gaddafi 's 42-year rule , still fly above many of the buildings in Sirte , but the commander said , the defending forces appeared to have lost their cohesion . `` We 've noticed now they are fighting every man for himself , '' said Baloun Al Sharie , a field commander . `` We tried to tell them it 's enough and to give themselves up , but they would not . '' NTC officers say Gaddafi loyalists fear reprisals if they give themselves up . Some captured fighters have been roughed up by NTC forces and Amnesty International issued a report on Wednesday saying Libya 's new rulers were in danger of repeating human rights abuses commonplace during Muammar Gaddafi 's rule . The NTC said it would look into the report . Close to the center of the fighting in Sirte , government forces found 25 corpses wrapped in plastic sheets . They accused Gaddafi militias of carrying out execution-style killings . Five corpses shown to a Reuters team wore civilian clothes , had their hands tied behind their backs and gunshot wounds to the head . As the tanks pounded the apartment blocks where Gaddafi 's men are holed up , pick-up trucks mounted with heavy machine guns moved in behind , then infantry armed with AK-47s began their assault . One field hospital received two NTC dead and 23 wounded on Thursday . One of the dead men had been hit while taking food up to the fighters on the front line , doctors said . In the skies , NATO aircraft have been carrying out reconnaissance missions and Britain said its jets had bombed and destroyed two pick-up trucks belonging to Gaddafi 's forces in Sirte on Wednesday . But as the battle for Libya draws toward what the NTC and NATO hope will be a close , both the new government and the Western alliance which helped topple Gaddafi are looking toward a return to normality . The provisional Libyan government and NATO signed an agreement on Thursday to immediately open air corridors for international civilian flights from Benghazi , and domestic flights between the second city and Tripoli and Misrata . This is one of the first step toward NATO lifting its no-fly zone over Libya imposed after Gaddafi began a military assault on civilians protesting his one-man rule . German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said 150 wounded Libyans would be treated in Germany . Berlin plans to support Libya with medical supplies and aid and help in training and educating young Libyans , he said `` We are here because we see the most important raw material of Libya , it is not oil and gas ... -LRB- it is -RRB- the younger people who started the revolution here . They need future and perspective after their victory , '' Roesler told a news conference in Tripoli . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . other media outlets are saying a different story , maybe maybe not . it has not been confirmed as 100 % fact . so why does your headlines read as such ? because you and the rest of the MSM believe whatever the NTC and NATO tells you . and the other side that is now the new rebels dont get any voice .

Libya was Italy 's third-biggest supplier of gas after Algeria and Russia and covered about 12.5 percent of its gas needs before flows via Greenstream were suspended in February because of civil war . The volumes of gas shipped during the testing period mark the preliminary restart of pipeline operations after nearly eight months , Eni said in a statement . The first tests will entail a flow of 3 million cubic metres of gas per day . `` The restart of Greenstream pipeline will allow us to face the coming winter with a greater level of supply security and also offset other possible risks with foreign -LRB- energy -RRB- supplies , '' Italian Industry Ministry Undersecretary Stefano Saglia said in a statement . Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni has said he hopes to begin gas exports through Greenstream in October . `` We will be able to increase production towards the end of November , '' Eni Exploration & Production Director General Claudio De Scalzi told Sky TV . The 520 km Greenstream pipeline runs from Mellitah to Gela on the Italian island of Sicily and has a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres . The mere fact that test flows have resumed should reverse the prevailing sentiment that European gas markets are undersupplied , Societe Generale analyst Thierry Bros said in a research note . He said the prospect of material Libyan supplies reaching Italy this year could create a supply glut domestically , forcing Eni to cancel some deliveries from Gazprom under take-or-pay obligations . This would require Eni to pay for gas it did not use , a situation it has largely avoided during the Greenstream outage . `` If material volumes of Libyan gas were to arrive in Italy during winter 2011\\/12 , other suppliers -LRB- Russia , Norway and\\/or Qatar -RRB- would need to curb supply to avoid flooding the European market , '' Bros said . Moreover , a quick return of Libyan supplies could drive European gas prices lower across the board , reversing prevailing views of a looming shortage caused by cutoffs in Middle Eastern supply and greater demand in Asia . Rapid stockpiling during summer months and diminished demand across Europe makes the region more susceptible to a downside shock , he added . Test flows of Libyan gas to Italy may also ease supply shortages caused by the closure of the Switzerland-Italy Transitgas pipeline on Tuesday , after heavy rainfall and snow melt exposed sections of the link 's southern leg . Italy has boosted imports of gas from Russia and northern Europe and has drawn more on its gas stocks to offset shortfalls in imports from Libya , Saglia said . Since spring , Italy has managed to replenish its gas reserves to about 87 percent of capacity , despite the lack of Libyan gas and aims to completely rebuild the stocks by the end of October , Saglia said . The first tests have run with 3 million cubic meters of gas per day , produced by the Wafa field , located about 500 km southwest of Tripoli in the Libyan desert , Eni said . The Wafa field , which largely supplies the Libyan domestic market for power generation , has been producing gas throughout the conflict to provide power to the local population , it said . NOC and Eni , which are equal partners in Greenstream BV , the company that operates the pipeline , as well as in the Mellitah Oil & Gas Company , operator of production fields in Libya , have been working together to restore production at all their joint fields in Libya , Eni said . Eni also said it was working with NOC and Mellitah Oil & Gas to restart gas output in November at the offshore platform of Sabratah , about 110 km off Libya 's coast in the Bahr Essalam gas field . They also aim to restart the associated treatment and processing facilities at the Mellitah terminal on the western part of the Libyan coast , from where Greenstream transports gas to Italy . Bahr Essalam field is an important source of gas supply for Greenstream , and resuming production there will trigger a gradual increase of the volumes available , Eni said .

The fund was set up in a Qatari account to circumvent sanctions in order to help the erstwhile rebels during the war against Muammar Gaddafi . It has swollen to more than half a billion U.S. dollars , but only a fraction of the money donated , unfrozen or on loan has been spent . The fund says it is no longer responsible for providing emergency cash and its current mandate is to invest in long-term projects , its manager Mazin Ramadan told Reuters . International aid organizations should tackle the humanitarian crisis , he said . `` We want to fund civil society in Libya , we need to do a better job of communicating that , '' Ramadan said . He said confusion had arisen because of the fund 's early involvement in emergency activities , but it was now focusing on designing a program to fund future non-governmental organizations based in Libya . When Qatar set up the fund in April , the aim was to provide Libya with a lifeline down which other countries could channel funds without violating sanctions . Qatar was the first Arab state to recognize the then opposition and donated the first $ 100 million . Many Libyans are still desperate for money and it is no longer clear where they can hope to obtain cash , or who will help the swelling numbers of internally displaced people . `` Unfrozen money has been put in the Temporary Financing Mechanism , but it takes a long time for them to use it , '' secretary of finance Emraja Gaith told Reuters in an interview . Cash freed up by foreign governments should be transferred directly to the central bank , he said , because it could process urgent payments more effectively . -LRB- ID : nL5E7LA3NX -RRB- But local authorities say they have only received a fraction of the money they need to cope with the flood of families escaping the fighting in the last two places where Gaddafi loyalists are still holding out ; Sirte and Bani Walid . Some have even journeyed to the capital , cap in hand , to ask new government head Mustafa Abdel Jalil directly for funds . As Jalil met the Canadian ambassador , Hakim Badran from Mizdah council waited to see him and ask for money he said was urgently needed to cope with the thousands taking shelter in schools and homes in his village , just west of Bani Walid . `` Jalil told me if I came here I could speak to him , '' Badran said . In Tripoli , officials said the capital 's resources were also being tested by the arrival of thousands of internally displaced people and more money was needed to provide services in the capital . `` In Tripoli we have only received a small amount of the money we asked for . We have 15 million dinar -LRB- $ 12.2 million -RRB- ... this is not enough , '' said Ahmed Al Tarhouni , an aide to the council 's head , Abderrazzaq Buhagiar . Officially the Temporary Financing Mechanism now tops $ 500 million , after $ 400 million was released from frozen Libyan assets in the United States , further donations were made from Bahrain and Kuwait and Germany made a loan in August . About $ 130 million has been spent so far ; on fuel , hospital bills and salaries delivered to a remote mountain region that had been struggling without cash for months . Fund officials say further projects will go to non-governmental organizations able to meet the needs of Libyans who have lost their homes , incomes or family in the war , and decentralise some spending power to local government . But many of the councillors interviewed were unaware of the fund , or did not know whether they qualified for money . Most of Libya 's estimated $ 170 billion in frozen assets are still out of reach , and despite pledges by global powers to make money available , just one third of a promised $ 15 billion has been unfrozen . The National Transitional Council has spent $ 1.6 billion so far , the bulk of which has been handed to local councils to provide salaries in many areas which had not seen a pay packet since the uprising began in February . -LRB- # 1 = 1.23 Libyan dinars -RRB- -LRB- Editing by Jon Hemming -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "32", "dct": "2011-10-17", "dates": ["2011-10-17", "2011-10-17", "2011-10-14", "2010-12-01", "2011-09-01", "2012-09-01"], "text": "LONDON | Mon Oct 17 , 2011 9:08 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Pro-Gaddafi fighters may resort to hit-and-run guerilla attacks against Libyan politicians , foreign workers and oil installations in the remote southwestern Fezzan district if they are driven from their last bastions , risk consultants say . A full-scale insurgency like the one that erupted in Iraq following the ouster of Saddam Hussein by U.S.-led forces is unlikely , but a determined guerrilla campaign could make life difficult for Libya 's new rulers and foreign oil companies considering a return . `` Gaddafi supporters will not be able to conduct an insurgency because they do not have the popular support , but they have the technical ability to launch a bombing and assassination campaign against foreigners and NTC leaders , '' said Firas Abi Ali , deputy head of Middle East and North Africa forecasting for Exclusive Analysis . Forces loyal to Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council are now moving more tanks into the center of Sirte to try to crush the last pocket of resistance by loyalists of ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi in his home town . Other loyalists are still holding out in Bani Walid . But guerrilla tactics , used throughout Libyan history against colonial rulers , could stall efforts to rebuild the country after eight months of fighting and ward off foreign oil workers , who are seen as key to restoring output to pre-war levels of 1.6 million barrels per day . Such a strategy would also complicate decisions for foreign airlines and oil companies torn between returning to business and protecting their staff in the heavily-armed and heavily-mined country . Many are for now settling for quick meet-and-greet encounters with Libya 's new leaders in Tripoli until they get further assurances on safety . Control Risks last week dropped its assessment of the travel risk to Tripoli to `` high '' but the classification remains `` extreme '' in many other parts of the country . But that was before a gunbattle erupted in the Libyan capital on Friday between NTC forces and up to 50 armed supporters of the deposed Gaddafi . Even for those who think the gains justify the risks , insurance premiums are high for doing business in a country where NATO has vowed to extend an air-and-sea campaign until at least December . Analysts said that the highest-risk area for attacks was in the oil-rich southwestern Saharan desert region , Fezzan , which was held by pro-Gaddafi fighters until late September . Fezzan , where many Libyans believe their former leader is in hiding , is home to Eni 's Elephant and Repsol 's Sharara fields . Their combined capacity of around 330,000 bpd is about a fifth of Libya 's total pre-war output . While the impact on the oil industry in this region would be less than in the Sirte Basin , now deemed to be relatively secure , attacks could still slow or even halt the ramp-up in oil production keenly awaited by cash-strapped Libyan leaders and consumer countries alike . Control Risk 's Henry Smith said installations in the remote Fezzan region were an easy target for roaming militia who could strike , then swiftly disappear back into the desert . `` The most significant security threats to oil assets are in the Ubari sand sea , broadly between Ghadames , Sabha and Ghat . It is not secure and anyone who has been there will tell you it will remain difficult to police , particularly given the lack of a central security force , '' he said . Oil facilities have already been attacked by pro-Gaddafi forces this summer , and in September the Ras Lanuf refinery and export terminal in eastern Libya was ambushed and 17 killed despite being behind NTC lines and supposedly protected by the eastern brigades . `` There 's a high risk of hit-and-run attacks on oil workers , blowing up pumping stations or shooting down aircraft that carry people and equipment to fields in the Ubari and Murzuq basins , '' said Firas Abi Ali , referring to parts of southwest Libya . Both consultants warned that the risk was higher because of the number of unsecured weapons in the country left over from the conflict , including anti-aircraft missiles . Turkish Airlines has resumed commercial flights to Libya despite the no-fly zone but other carriers have been more cautious . British Airways , for instance saying it would not resume operations before a NATO no-fly zone was lifted . Even some Libyan oil workers are apprehensive about returning to desert oilfields after some of the facilities were sabotaged by militia . `` If they find out people are here they might come back , '' said an oilfield manager in the region . -LRB- Reporting by Emma Farge ; Additional reporting by Jessica Donati and Dmitry Zhdannikov ; Editing by Jon Boyle -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

BENGHAZI , Libya | Mon Oct 17 , 2011 3:25 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - After weeks on the run , thousands of black Libyans driven from their homes during the revolt against Muammar Gaddafi have resurfaced across the country , finding refuge in a squalid camp they hope is only temporary . Once residents of Gaddafi 's stronghold of Tawergha , the families now wander a dusty compound ringed with garbage and staffed by a handful of volunteers from the city of Benghazi struggling to prevent the spread of disease as numbers swell . The group 's eastward flight began last summer , when anti-Gaddafi forces overran Tawergha and vengeance-seeking crowds ransacked it , leaving a ghost town behind . `` They chased us with guns and knives , '' said Ibrahim Med Khaled , a 24-year-old taxi driver recently arrived at the former construction site after spending weeks dodging hostile crowds across the country 's west before being captured by armed men . `` They brought me to a house and beat me with electrical cable to make me confess I worked for Gaddafi , even though I told them I never carried a gun , '' he said , lifting his shirt to reveal shoulders criss-crossed with fresh wounds from flogging . Throughout the uprising against Gaddafi 's 42-year rule , his opponents have accused him of hiring fighters from neighboring African countries which led to reports of mistreatment of blacks , including Libyans . The camp has grown since opening from 400 to nearly 3,000 people in just two weeks , despite disrepair and lack of sufficient sanitation and electricity evidenced by raw sewage pooling behind some of the housing blocks . Aid workers say overcrowding is forcing hundreds to set up makeshift settlements near by . Some of the men at the camp , guarded by troops loyal to the interim government which ousted Gaddafi , still wear camouflage trousers they may have donned last summer in support of Gaddafi . One little girl could be seen eating spilled food off the ground . `` We have a big heath problem here , '' said Randa Muftah Salem-Oun , a 23-year-old medical student now head doctor at the site , where her day begins at dawn and ends after midnight . `` We need many supplies , wound dressings and medicine , '' she said , adding that many at the camp suffered from gastroenteritis - a telltale sign of contaminated food or water - and that hepatitis was also discovered among the sick . However dire the conditions may be , the camp 's residents say they are torn between desire to return , and fear of reprisals from heavily armed locals still bitter from one of the bloodiest episodes in Libya 's civil war . Many accuse men from Tawergha of committing atrocities in the siege of the city of Misrata , and tales of raping sprees by sub-Saharan African mercenaries - fueled in one version by Viagra doled out by Gaddafi - abound in Libya , leaving dark-skinned people suspect to some of their countrymen . Another former Tawergha resident , a 38-year-old mother of four named Rabha Mouftah , said there was no doubt as to the intentions of the mob that stormed into her town last summer . `` They came to kill black people , '' she said in a room with no lighting she now shares with her family off an alley strewn with debris . `` We were scared to go outside , so we hid in different houses for seven weeks , then came here . '' The Tawergha displaced add yet another delicate task to the growing workload of Libya 's interim rulers , the National Transitional Council , -LRB- NTC -RRB- as they try to reunify the country and impose the rule of law amid renewed opposition from Gaddafi loyalists , who launched attacks in the capital Tripoli last week for the first time since it fell in August . It also highlights a potential future division in the post-Gaddafi era as leaders strive to integrate a legion of factions , such as the Tuarag , a black tribe of nomads some of whom still support the ousted leader . Some groups have reported arbitrary arrests across the country on suspicion of collusion with the former leader , believed to be somewhere in Libya 's vast southern desert . While the NTC favors the return of Tawargha 's residents , it admits this will take time . But resolving the issue remains a test of its leadership to come . Much of the city lays in ruins and people in neighboring Misrata say tensions are still too high to allow a return that could spark more violence . `` In the end it 's another ghost of Gaddafi -- he paid many of the tribes to fight for him , so now people see black people and immediately assume they support him , even if they do n't , '' said Imad Eddin , an anesthesiologist volunteering at the camp .

TRIPOLI | Tue Oct 18 , 2011 7:39 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an unannounced visit to Libya on Tuesday to cement relations with the new leaders Washington helped install , offer aid and encourage them to follow through on a promise of swift elections . Clinton arrived in Tripoli aboard a U.S. military aircraft to begin the one-day visit during which she was scheduled to meet leaders from the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , civil society activists and staff of the newly re-opened U.S. embassy . She will announce a set of new programs designed to foster closer U.S.-Libyan ties including U.S. help for treating fighters wounded in Libya 's insurrection , resuming student exchange programs and more help for Libya 's effort to track down and destroy dangerous Gaddafi-era weaponry . Clinton is the most senior U.S. official to visit Tripoli since rebel forces battling longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi seized the capital in August with the help of NATO warplanes . U.S. officials said her visit underscored Washington 's hope to work with Libya 's new leaders as they guide the country toward elections and begin to reform its economy . The United States took part in the NATO bombing campaign that helped install the NTC in power , although it was mostly in a support role with France and Britain in the lead . The French and British leaders visited Tripoli together last month . Clinton 's visit was secret prior to her arrival in Tripoli and marked by tight security . U.S. officials said Clinton would discuss Libya 's plans for political transition with NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , de facto prime minister Mahmoud Jibril and Ali Tarhouni , who holds both the finance and oil portfolios . NTC forces are still fighting against remaining Gaddafi loyalists in his hometown Sirte and other pockets of resistance , while they are also seeking to bring under centralized control the plethora of rebel militias which sprang up in the revolt . A senior U.S. official traveling with Clinton told reporters Clinton would discuss security while stressing the importance of the NTC sticking to its plan for an eight-month timeline toward elections once the country is fully under its control . `` The important thing is to be able to show the Libyan people that there is momentum , '' the official said . `` We 're pushing the -LRB- NTC -RRB- to be able to show the Libyan people that they 're serious in their commitments to transition , that they 're serious in their commitments to rule of law , that they 're serious about getting to those elections . '' The United States has contributed a total of about $ 140 million in aid to Libya since the start of the uprising . Clinton was expected to unveil funding for several more initiatives . She will increase to about $ 40 million the U.S. contribution toward Libya 's effort to track down and destroy weapons including shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that western officials fear could fall into militant hands . Libya was thought to have had about 20,000 such missiles when the war against Gaddafi began in February . While large numbers were destroyed in NATO air strikes , experts believe many are still unaccounted for and NATO countries have said there is an urgent need to track them down . Clinton will also announce new U.S. programs to help the NTC care for fighters wounded in the war , including working with the private sector to re-equip Libya 's hospitals and clinics , set up a patient tracking system and possibly bring some of the most severely wounded to the United States for treatment . The United Nations has estimated that about 15,000 fighters were wounded in Libya 's war including about 1,500 amputees . U.S. officials say helping the NTC care for these casualties could help cement political support for the interim council . `` This has humanitarian aspects , but it also has political ramifications : that the people who fought for Libya 's future , fought for the new Libya , can be cared for by Libya 's governing institutions , '' the senior U.S. official said . -LRB- Reporting By Andrew Quinn ; Editing by Christian Lowe -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

SIRTE , Libya | Wed Oct 19 , 2011 11:59 pm BST SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan interim government fighters have renewed their offensive on the besieged town of Sirte after being pushed back by die-hard Muammar Gaddafi loyalists holed up in the deposed leader 's home town . Hundreds of National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- troops have surrounded the Mediterranean coastal town for weeks in a chaotic struggle to snuff out the last pocket of resistance against the revolution that ended Gaddafi 's 42-year rule . Grad rockets , artillery and tank fire rained down on pro-Gaddafi positions in the center of the town on Wednesday . Asked about the government forces ' slow progress in taking Sirte , one NTC fighter at the front said : `` All we can think of is catching the rat Gaddafi . We are taking it slowly , step by step . We have been patient for 42 years . '' NTC fighters have deployed an arsenal of homemade weapons . On Wednesday a bulldozer arrived at the front fitted with armor and resembling a small ship , with a pointed prow and port holes . On its front was mounted a tank turret and the sides were made from concrete sandwiched between steel plate . A man wearing a black ship 's captain 's hat with gold braid sat atop the contraption as it manoeuvred into place , ploughing into a lamp-post in the process . Government fighters shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' -LRB- God is greatest -RRB- as it made its lumbering progress towards make-shift barricades of vehicles and shipping containers put up by Gaddafi loyalists . The NTC 's failure to seize Sirte , nearly two months since the fall of Tripoli , has raised questions about its ability to exert its authority over the entire country and has postponed the launch of its promised democracy program . On Monday , NTC forces captured the other main Gaddafi stronghold , the desert town of Bani Walid , where the ousted leader 's loyalists had put up resistance for two months . NTC forces were poised a few days ago to declare victory in Sirte , but on Tuesday they were forced to retreat in some places under intense fire . But a day later , NTC fighters had taken back the lost ground and made further gains so that for the first time government forces attacking from the east and west could see each other 's positions through the Gaddafi-held enclave . Fighters reported Gaddafi soldiers had been firing at them wearing civilian clothes so had stepped up security and were closely checking the identities of everyone at the front , including reporters . But faced with a disciplined and determined force , many NTC fighters theorised the defenders may be guarding a high-value target , perhaps even Gaddafi himself . `` Why else would a sniper try to take on a tank ? '' asked Jafar Al Sharif who commands some eight tanks positioned in the streets of Sirte pounding the low-rise apartment blocks housing Gaddafi remaining loyalists . The NTC offensive , by mostly amateur fighters , has been hampered by a lack of coordination . Units which converged on Sirte from Benghazi in eastern Libya and Misrata to the west have lost men when they fired at each other by mistake . Gaddafi , wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of ordering the killing of civilians , is in hiding , possibly deep in Libya 's Sahara desert . Inspired by protests in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt that ended in the overthrow of long-standing autocratic leaders , Libyans rose up against Gaddafi in February , but it took six months of civil war to end his one-man rule . The NTC lent its backing to another regional revolt on Wednesday , officially recognizing as Syria 's legitimate authority an umbrella opposition council struggling to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad . While Gaddafi himself is still at large , his wife , two sons and a daughter fled to neighbouring Algeria shortly after Tripoli was captured by the NTC in August . Algeria 's foreign minister said his country let them in for `` humanitarian reasons . '' The NTC at the time called it an `` act of aggression , '' but has since moved to patch up ties with Algeria . `` Algeria has systematically honored all its obligations as a member of the international community , '' Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told a news conference in Algiers alongside British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Wednesday . Hague , on a tour of the region , said he respected Algeria 's position but had requested all countries in the region honor obligations to turn over any indicted war crimes suspects .

The exact circumstances of his demise are still unclear with conflicting accounts of his death . But the footage of the last chaotic moments of Gaddafi 's life offered some clues into what happened . Gaddafi was still alive when he was captured near Sirte . In the video , filmed by a bystander in the crowd and later aired on television , Gaddafi is shown dazed and wounded being dragged off a vehicle 's bonnet and pulled to the ground by his hair . `` Keep him alive , keep him alive ! '' Gaddafi then goes out of view and gunshots ring out . `` They captured him alive and while he was being taken away , they beat him and then they killed him , '' one senior source in the NTC told Reuters . `` He might have been resisting . '' In what appeared to contradict the events depicted in the video , Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council said Gaddafi was killed when a gunfight broke out after his capture between his supporters and government fighters . He died from a bullet wound to the head , the prime minister said . The NTC said no order had been given to kill him . Gaddafi called the rebels who rose up against his 42 years of one-man rule `` rats , '' but in the end it appeared that it was he who was captured cowering in a drainage pipe full of rubbish and filth . `` He called us rats , but look where we found him , '' said Ahmed Al Sahati , a 27-year-old government fighter , standing next to two stinking drainage pipes under a six-lane highway near Sirte . On the ground , government fighters described scenes of carnage as they told stories of Gaddafi 's final hours . Shortly before dawn prayers , Gaddafi , surrounded by a few dozen loyal bodyguards and accompanied by the head of his now non-existent army Abu Bakr Younis Jabr , broke out of the two-month siege of Sirte and made a break for the west . They did not get far . France said its aircraft struck military vehicles belonging to Gaddafi forces near Sirte at about 8:30 a.m. -LRB- 0630 GMT -RRB- , but said it was unsure whether the strikes had killed Gaddafi . A NATO official said the convoy was hit either by a French plane or a U.S. Predator drone . Two miles west of Sirte , 15 pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns lay burned out , smashed and smoldering next to an electricity substation 20 meters from the main road . They had clearly been hit by a force far beyond anything the motley army the former rebels has assembled during eight months of revolt to overthrow the once feared leader . There was no bomb crater , indicating the strike may have been carried out by a jet fighter . Inside the trucks still in their seats sat the charred skeletal remains of drivers and passengers killed instantly by the strike . Other bodies lay mutilated and contorted strewn across the grass . Some 50 bodies in all . Mansour Daou , leader of Gaddafi 's personal bodyguards , was with the former strongman shortly before his end . He told al Arabiya television that after the air strike the survivors had `` split into groups and each group went its own way . '' `` I was with Gaddafi and Abu Bakr Younis Jabr and about four volunteer soldiers . '' Daou said he had not witnessed his leader 's death because he had fallen unconscious after being wounded in the back by a shell explosion . Fighters on the ground said Gaddafi and a handful of his men appeared to have run through a stand of trees and taken refuge in the two drainage pipes . `` At first we fired at them with anti-aircraft guns , but it was no use , '' said Salem Bakeer , while being feted by his comrades near the road . `` Then we went in on foot . `` One of Gaddafi 's men came out waving his rifle in the air and shouting surrender , but as soon as he saw my face he started shooting at me , '' he told Reuters . `` Then I think Gaddafi must have told them to stop . ` My master is here , my master is here ' , he said , ` Muammar Gaddafi is here and he is wounded ' , '' said Bakeer . `` We went in and brought Gaddafi out . He was saying ` what 's wrong ? What 's going on ? ' . Then we took him and put him in the car , '' Bakeer said . At the time of his capture , Gaddafi was already wounded with gunshots to his leg and to his back , Bakeer said . Other government fighters who said they took part in Gaddafi 's capture , separately confirmed Bakeer 's version of events , though one said the man who ruled Libya for 42 years was shot and wounded at the last minute by one of his own men . `` One of Muammar Gaddafi 's guards shot him in the chest , '' said Omran Jouma Shawan . There were also other versions of events . NTC official Abdel Majid Mlegta told Reuters Gaddafi had been finally cornered in a compound in Sirte after hours of fighting , and wounded in a gun battle with NTC forces . He said Gaddafi kept repeating `` What is the matter ? What 's going on ? What do you want ? '' and resisted as NTC fighters seized him . He added that Gaddafi died of his wounds as he was being transported in an ambulance . `` He was bleeding from his stomach . It took a long time to transport him . He bled to death -LRB- in the ambulance -RRB- , '' he said . Another NTC official , speaking to Reuters anonymously , gave a violent account of Gaddafi 's death : `` They -LRB- NTC fighters -RRB- beat him very harshly and then they killed him . This is a war . '' Some video footage showed what appeared to be Gaddafi 's lifeless body being loaded into an ambulance in Sirte . One of the fighters who said he took part in the capture brandished a heavily engraved golden pistol he said he had taken from Gaddafi . Fallen electricity cables partially covered the entrance to the pipes and the bodies of three men , apparently Gaddafi bodyguards lay at the entrance to one end , one in shorts probably due to a bandaged wound on his leg . Four more bodies lay at the other end of the pipes . All black men , one had his brains blown out , another man had been decapitated , his dreadlocked head lying beside his torso . Army chief Jabr was also captured alive , Bakeer said . NTC officials later announced he was dead . Joyous government fighters fired their weapons in the air , shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' and posed for pictures . Others wrote graffiti on the concrete parapets of the highway . One said simply : `` Gaddafi was captured here . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Could n't have happened to a more repugnant piece of scum .

Leaders of European nations that rallied support for a NATO campaign launched in March hailed the news Gaddafi had been killed in his hometown of Sirte on Thursday , capping months of bloody conflict between Gaddafi loyalists and Western-backed rebels . That contrasted with the circumspect tone in Washington , where military leaders from the start voiced skepticism about a third war in a Muslim country and where budget woes fueled ambivalence toward involvement in a nation with scant U.S. interests . President Barack Obama congratulated Libyans on the end to over 40 years of autocracy , but appeared to distance the United States as he placed the responsibility for Libya 's future squarely on its people 's shoulders . `` The American people wish the people of Libya the very best in what will be a challenging , but hopeful days , weeks , months and years ahead , '' Obama told reporters . Yet after months of seeking a supporting role , Washington may be forced into the foreground if European nations do not provide robust support for what is likely to be a shaky political transition or if Libya descends into civil war . `` Ideally for the Obama administration , the Europeans should take the lead in developing a new regime , just as they did in bringing down the old one , '' said Kamran Bokhari , a security expert with the STRATFOR global intelligence firm . `` But there is a difference between what one wants and what one can actually get , '' he said . `` Again , everyone 's going to be looking at Washington . '' Looming large in U.S. officials ' minds is the violence that spiraled out of control in Iraq following Saddam Hussein 's capture , trial and execution , which kept the United States in Iraq for years at great financial and human cost . The Gaddafi government 's downfall in August and now his death will go some way to validating what became known as the `` Obama doctrine , '' in which Washington , unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan , played a more modest role rather than acting as de facto leader of an anemic coalition . Following initial criticism for failing to act quickly in Libya , U.S. officials went to great lengths after the early weeks of the air campaign to make NATO the face of international military assistance for the ragtag rebel force . Despite the Pentagon 's heavy lifting on refueling , logistics and surveillance , nations like France and Britain embraced more forward-leaning military and diplomatic roles . Still , given its military might , Washington may find itself playing an important role even after the NATO mission ends in providing training and other assistance to the new Libyan military or making use of its unique air assets . Perhaps the biggest question mark in determining the future U.S. role in Libya is the ability of its new leadership to stave off prolonged civil strife in an ethnically and tribally fractured country reeling after months of bloody conflict . After Gaddafi 's death , it remains unclear whether Libya 's motley array of new leaders , with their diverse ideologies , can forge a unified path in a country new to democracy or whether remaining Gaddafi supporters will keep putting up a fight . `` Now more than ever , the risk of them not succeeding has increased as the one thing that hung everyone together is gone , '' Bokhari said . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton articulated during a visit to Libya this week the widespread U.S. concerns about how well a host of militias can be streamlined into a single national army and about quickly establishing law and order . Another obstacle for Libya , where Gaddafi commanded almost absolute power for decades , is its lack of strong government institutions that could smooth the path ahead . `` The success achieved thus far is very , very limited compared to the challenges that lie ahead , '' Les Gelb , an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations , told reporters . Equally unclear is the precise nature of future U.S. nonmilitary involvement in the new Libya . Since the conflict began , the United States has spent at least $ 135 million on humanitarian and other aid to Libya , a paltry sum next to the billions of dollars it has poured into rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan . The administration will likely aim to keep its financial support modest to an oil-rich country that already has billions of dollars in assets from the Gaddafi government at its disposal . While Clinton promised to expand support for a nascent democracy , she vowed to find public-private funding for other initiatives like treating war victims in the United States . As the Obama administration scrambles to stave off a budget crisis , the State Department also announced this week it had not sought new congressional funding for aid to Libya . That could change if robust aid fails to materialize from Europe -- where political leaders are staring down their own fiscal crisis -- and if Washington feels aid could fend off a risky destabilization for a region already gripped by change . There could be also be big U.S. commercial interest in a country where recent years of expanded foreign investment halted in February with the start of the uprising . U.S. companies with operations in Libya include ConocoPhillips , Occidental and other firms involved in construction and oil field services . `` What U.S. business needs in any market is security and transparency and stability , '' said Chuck Dittrich , executive director of the U.S.-Libya Business Association . `` I think this enables Libya to close the book on 40 years of a nightmare .

The interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro-Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilize the north African OPEC member and its oil industry . One of Gaddafi 's most politically influential sons , Saif al-Islam , and his security chief Abdullah Sanussi are apparently still at large and may still be able to recruit armed followers . But perhaps the most important test for the interim National Transitional Council will be to manage the enormous expectations of Libya 's 6 million people , now freed definitively from the fear that Gaddafi could ever reimpose his long strongman rule . `` There is now this massive expectation . Up to now they 've had an excuse that they are running a war . They do n't have that now ... Everything now has got to happen , '' John Hamilton , a Libya expert at Cross Border Information , told Reuters . `` That 's a hard task . They have to deliver for the people ... On the other hand , this may renew the honeymoon they enjoyed when Tripoli fell , if they can put a decent government together in a short time . '' The news of Gaddafi 's capture and killing came minutes after reports that his hometown Sirte had fallen amid raids by NATO warplanes , extinguishing the last significant resistance by loyalist forces . The capture of Sirte and the death of Gaddafi means Libya 's ruling NTC should now begin the task of forging a new democratic system which it had said it would get under way after the city , built as a showpiece for Gaddafi 's rule , had fallen . Some fear instability may linger and unsettle that process . `` Gaddafi is now a martyr and thus can become the rallying point for irredentist or tribal violence -- perhaps not in the immediate future but in the medium-to-long term , '' said George Joffe , a north Africa expert at Cambridge University . `` The fact that NATO can be blamed for his death is worrying , in terms of regional support , and may undermine the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council . '' But the interim NTC authorities are also faced with a possibly more critical task , namely getting under control a clutch of anti-Gaddafi armed militias competing , so far peacefully , for ample share of funding and political representation in a post-Gaddafi Libya . Libya expert Alex Warren , of Frontier MEA , a Middle East and north Africa research and advisory firm , said the death of Gaddafi `` is clearly a momentous event and far more than just a symbolic one . '' But he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' Under rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . On declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . A 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . The national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . Some worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . Now he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . Warren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . `` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . In recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . U.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . `` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . `` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores .

The likely decision to end the alliance 's patrols over the skies of Libya at the end of the month marks another milestone in what the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- has pledged will be a road toward democracy and free and fair elections in 2013 . But the deaths of Gaddafi and his son Mo ` tassim after both were captured wounded but alive on Thursday and the grisly public display of their decomposing bodies in a Misrata meat locker have made the NTC 's Western backers uneasy about Libya 's prospects for stable government and respect for the rule of law . Gaddafi and Mo ` tassim were buried in a secret desert location on Tuesday to prevent their graves becoming a shrine for any remaining followers in the oil-rich North African state . Under pressure from Western allies , the NTC promised on Monday to investigate how Gaddafi and his son were killed . Mobile phone footage shows both alive after their capture . The former leader was seen being mocked , beaten and abused before he died , in what NTC officials say was crossfire . The treatment of others who supported Gaddafi and fought alongside him was now an issue , said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman . `` This is a test . The NTC has repeatedly said that they will distinguish themselves from the Gaddafi regime in terms of the respect of human rights and the rule of law , '' he told a news conference in Morocco . `` Now is the time for them to begin actions that will help them reinforce these words . '' Emerging from 42 years of often brutal one-man rule , many Libyans are savoring the end of eight months of bitter civil war won with NATO 's backing and are unconcerned about how Gaddafi met his end and how his body was treated afterwards . `` Throw him in a hole , in the sea , in garbage . He is lower than a donkey or a dog and only foreigners say they care about how we killed him . And they are lying , '' said engineer Ali Azzarog , 47 . Hatred of Gaddafi unified his disparate opponents , who will likely now tussle for power during a planned transition to democracy in a nation riven with regional and tribal rivalries . With economic problems at home , NATO countries are expected to endorse an end to their U.N.-mandated mission in Libya when their ambassadors meet in Brussels on Wednesday after a preliminary decision last week to end it on October 31 . `` We said that we would consult closely with the United Nations and the NTC and that process of consultations is ongoing , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said . Libyan interim Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said he wanted NATO to maintain its mission for another month , but hoped for a swift end to United Nations sanctions to free up funds for the interim government to pay salaries and help reconstruction . NATO spokeswoman Lungescu declined to say whether NATO might extend the mission . `` I do n't know whether there is a formal request . All these things remain to be sorted out . But in the end this is a political decision , '' she said . NATO 's Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs and Security Policy , James Appathurai , said he expected the alliance to confirm its decision to end the mission . `` I do n't expect that there will be a change to that decision , because it is quite clear that the pro-Gaddafi elements no longer have the command and control or other capabilities to pose an organized threat to civilians . That is now finished , and as a result our operation will end , '' he said . Western military powers have already begun winding down the Libyan mission , and diplomats have said the majority of NATO equipment , including fighter jets , has already been withdrawn . A NATO statement on Tuesday said operations in the interim would involve intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions , although NATO would retain the capability to conduct air strikes if they were needed . The one remaining element from the old order is Gaddafi 's sons , the enigmatic Saif al-Islam , who remains on the run . Once viewed as a moderate reformer , he vowed to help his father crush his enemies once the revolt began . An NTC official said Saif al-Islam was in the southern desert near Niger and Algeria and was set to flee Libya using a false passport . -LRB- Reporting by Taha Zargoun in Sirte , Barry Malone and Jessica Donati in Tripoli , Rania El Gamal and Tim Gaynor in Misrata , Christian Lowe , Jon Hemming and Andrew Hammond in Tunis , Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers , Samia Nakhoul in Dubai , Abdoulaye Massalaatchi in Niamey , Matt Falloon in London , Souhail Karam in Rabat ; Writing by Jon Hemming ; Editing by David Stamp and Ralph Gowling -RRB- "}, {"uid": "304", "dct": "2011-10-20", "dates": ["2011-10-20", "2011-10-20", "2011-10-20", "2011-10-22"], "text": "Thu Oct 20 , 2011 3:54 pm EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed when a gunfight broke out after his capture between his supporters and government fighters , and no order was given to kill him , officials with the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- said on Thursday .

The interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro-Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilize the north African OPEC member and its oil industry . Gaddafi 's death is expected to allow Libya to start earning money again by selling its oil on world markets as a more benign security environment allows oilfield staff to get back to work . But perhaps the most important test for the interim National Transitional Council will be to manage the enormous expectations of Libya 's 6 million people , now freed definitively from the fear that Gaddafi could ever reimpose his long strongman rule . `` There is now this massive expectation . Up to now they 've had an excuse that they are running a war . They do n't have that now ... Everything now has got to happen , '' John Hamilton , a Libya expert at Cross Border Information , told Reuters . `` That 's a hard task . They have to deliver for the people ... On the other hand , this may renew the honeymoon they enjoyed when Tripoli fell , if they can put a decent government together in a short time . '' The news of Gaddafi 's capture and killing came minutes after reports that his home town Sirte had fallen amid raids by NATO warplanes , extinguishing the last significant resistance by loyalist forces . The capture of Sirte and the death of Gaddafi means Libya 's ruling NTC should now begin the task of forging a new democratic system which it had said it would get under way after the city , built as a showpiece for Gaddafi 's rule , had fallen . An announcement that the country has achieved `` liberation '' is expected on Saturday , setting in motion a transition to democratic elections . Some fear instability may linger and unsettle that process . `` Gaddafi is now a martyr and thus can become the rallying point for irredentist or tribal violence -- perhaps not in the immediate future but in the medium-to-long term , '' said George Joffe , a north Africa expert at Cambridge University . `` The fact that NATO can be blamed for his death is worrying , in terms of regional support , and may undermine the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council . '' But the interim NTC authorities are also faced with a possibly more critical task , namely getting under control a clutch of anti-Gaddafi armed militias competing , so far peacefully , for ample share of funding and political representation in a post-Gaddafi Libya . Libya expert Alex Warren , of Frontier MEA , a Middle East and north Africa research and advisory firm , said the death of Gaddafi `` is clearly a momentous event and far more than just a symbolic one . '' But he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' Under rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . On declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . A 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . The national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . Some worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . Now he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . Warren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . `` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . In recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . U.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . `` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . `` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores . That may be a dangerous road .

The likely decision to end the alliance 's patrols over the skies of Libya at the end of the month marks another milestone in what the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- has pledged will be a road toward democracy and free and fair elections in 2013 . But the deaths of Gaddafi and his son Mo ` tassim after both were captured wounded but alive on Thursday and the grisly public display of their decomposing bodies in a Misrata meat locker have made the NTC 's Western backers uneasy about Libya 's prospects for stable government and respect for the rule of law . Gaddafi and Mo ` tassim were buried in a secret desert location on Tuesday to prevent their graves becoming a shrine for any remaining followers in the oil-rich North African state . Under pressure from Western allies , the NTC promised on Monday to investigate how Gaddafi and his son were killed . Mobile phone footage shows both alive after their capture . The former leader was seen being mocked , beaten and abused before he died , in what NTC officials say was crossfire . The treatment of others who supported Gaddafi and fought alongside him was now an issue , said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman . `` This is a test . The NTC has repeatedly said that they will distinguish themselves from the Gaddafi regime in terms of the respect of human rights and the rule of law , '' he told a news conference in Morocco . `` Now is the time for them to begin actions that will help them reinforce these words . '' Emerging from 42 years of often brutal one-man rule , many Libyans are savoring the end of eight months of bitter civil war won with NATO 's backing and are unconcerned about how Gaddafi met his end and how his body was treated afterwards . `` Throw him in a hole , in the sea , in garbage . He is lower than a donkey or a dog and only foreigners say they care about how we killed him . And they are lying , '' said engineer Ali Azzarog , 47 . Hatred of Gaddafi unified his disparate opponents , who will likely now tussle for power during a planned transition to democracy in a nation riven with regional and tribal rivalries . With economic problems at home , NATO countries are expected to endorse an end to their U.N.-mandated mission in Libya when their ambassadors meet in Brussels on Wednesday after a preliminary decision last week to end it on October 31 . `` We said that we would consult closely with the United Nations and the NTC and that process of consultations is ongoing , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said . Libyan interim Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said he wanted NATO to maintain its mission for another month , but hoped for a swift end to United Nations sanctions to free up funds for the interim government to pay salaries and help reconstruction . NATO spokeswoman Lungescu declined to say whether NATO might extend the mission . `` I do n't know whether there is a formal request . All these things remain to be sorted out . But in the end this is a political decision , '' she said . NATO 's Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs and Security Policy , James Appathurai , said he expected the alliance to confirm its decision to end the mission . `` I do n't expect that there will be a change to that decision , because it is quite clear that the pro-Gaddafi elements no longer have the command and control or other capabilities to pose an organized threat to civilians . That is now finished , and as a result our operation will end , '' he said . Western military powers have already begun winding down the Libyan mission , and diplomats have said the majority of NATO equipment , including fighter jets , has already been withdrawn . A NATO statement on Tuesday said operations in the interim would involve intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions , although NATO would retain the capability to conduct air strikes if they were needed . The one remaining element from the old order is Gaddafi 's sons , the enigmatic Saif al-Islam , who remains on the run . Once viewed as a moderate reformer , he vowed to help his father crush his enemies once the revolt began . An NTC official said Saif al-Islam was in the southern desert near Niger and Algeria and was set to flee Libya using a false passport . -LRB- Reporting by Taha Zargoun in Sirte , Barry Malone and Jessica Donati in Tripoli , Rania El Gamal and Tim Gaynor in Misrata , Christian Lowe , Jon Hemming and Andrew Hammond in Tunis , Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers , Samia Nakhoul in Dubai , Abdoulaye Massalaatchi in Niamey , Matt Falloon in London , Souhail Karam in Rabat ; Writing by Jon Hemming ; Editing by David Stamp and Ralph Gowling -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Now , of course , since NATO s humanitarian intervention the infrastructure of their country has been bombed back to the Stone Age . They will not have the same quality of life . Women probably will not have the same degree of emancipation under any new transitional government . The national wealth is probably going to be siphoned off by Western corporations . Perhaps the standard of living in Libya might have been slightly higher than it perhaps is now in America and the UK with the recession , she said . What really was the UN&NATO trying to achieve ? so in order to protect civiians they have overturned Gaddafi in favor of thr MUslim Brotherhood . So Libya = Egypt . It is about time . Now , will the NTC show that they are more of a nation or a bunch of outlaws . Try this person in the courts . If found guilty , punish him as a man . Let him die a humiliated dictaor .
