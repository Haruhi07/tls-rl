People around the world continue to pay tribute to the star . On Friday night thousands of fans came together in London 's Trafalgar Square to light candles and sing some of his biggest hits . Often called the King of Pop , Jackson will be remembered as one of the greatest entertainers of all time , having sold more than 250 million albums around the world . One of those , Thriller , is still the biggest-selling album ever , selling 61 million copies . That 's almost one copy for every single person living in the UK .

Police also want to speak to Jackson 's doctor who witnessed his collapse . Jackson 's body has been released to his family but no funeral details have been made public . Michael Jackson 's body moved to an `` undisclosed location '' Seven hours after the post-mortem examination was completed , Jackson 's family was allowed to claim his body , seemingly managing to elude the media crowd outside the coroner 's office . The body has been taken to an undisclosed location . Announcing the results of a three-hour autopsy , Los Angeles County Coroners spokesman Craig Harvey said there had been no indication of any external trauma or foul play , but he said the cause of death had been deferred . `` It means that the medical examiner ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies , '' Mr Harvey said . These would take between four to six weeks , he said . `` We know he was taking some prescription medication , '' Mr Harvey said , without specifying which .

He just did n't like to feel such discomfort . He started taking pain medication . It became part of his life , '' he said . A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said investigators had briefly spoken to Jackson 's personal doctor , named by US media as Dr Conrad Murray , but they wanted to speak to him again . Police also said a car owned by a doctor had been towed away from Jackson 's home . A spokeswoman said the doctor was not under criminal investigation , but that the car could contain `` medications or other evidence that may assist the coroner in determining the cause of death '' . The star had been due to stage 50 concerts at the O2 arena in London , beginning on 13 July . Entertainers , world leaders and fans have continued to pay tribute to the star . Across the world , people have been voicing shock and disbelief at the news of his death . In Hollywood , thousands of people filed past his star on the Walk of Fame . Dr Murray witnessed Jackson 's collapse A White House spokesman said US President Barack Obama considered Jackson a spectacular performer , but said he felt parts of his life were `` sad and tragic '' . Former Beatle Paul McCartney described Jackson as a `` massively talented boy-man with a gentle soul '' . Jackson began his career as a child in family group The Jackson 5 . He went on to achieve global fame as a solo artist with smash hits such as Billie Jean and Bad . Thriller , released in 1982 , is the biggest-selling album of all time , shifting 65m copies , according to the Guinness Book of World Records . He scored seven UK number ones as a solo artist and won a total of 13 Grammy awards . `` For Michael to be taken away from us so suddenly at such a young age , I just do n't have the words , '' said Quincy Jones , who produced Thriller , Bad and Off The Wall . `` He was the consummate entertainer and his contributions and legacy will be felt upon the world forever . I 've lost my little brother today , and part of my soul has gone with him . '' The singer had been dogged by controversy and money trouble in recent years , becoming a virtual recluse . He was arrested in 2003 on charges of molesting a 14-year-old boy , but was found not guilty following a five-month trial . The star had three children , Michael Joseph Jackson Jr , Paris Michael Katherine Jackson and Prince Michael Jackson II . Jackson 's former wife Debbie Rowe is the mother of two of the children , and there is already speculation about who will gain custody of them . He is survived by his mother , Katherine , father , Joseph and eight siblings - including Janet , Randy , Jermaine and La Toya Jackson .

Following the singer 's death , coroner spokesman Craig Harvey said preliminary results showed there was no indication of any external trauma or foul play , but said the cause of death had been deferred . He confirmed Jackson had been taking some prescription medication , but did not give any further details . Reports suggest the investigation around the star 's death is focusing on his use of powerful painkilling drugs . On Tuesday , police searched the Las Vegas home and offices of Jackson 's doctor , Conrad Murray , as part of a manslaughter investigation into the singer 's death . Dr Murray 's lawyer said officials , who were looking for Jackson 's medical records , seized mobile phones and a computer hard drive .

Sarah Jane and Dominic join Bob for his After Midnight acoustic session this week . Purcell And Dryden -- A Professional Friendship Alyn Shipton 's exploration of Dryden and Purcell 's collaboration on semi-opera King Arthur brings to life the world of Restoration theater . People came in and out for single acts of an opera , jostled in the stalls , and swapped seats in boxes . More privileged members of society claimed seats on the stage , where they could indulge in repartee with the cast -- a far cry from the hallowed atmosphere in which many modern performances of this opera take place . Contributor and Purcell biographer Jonathan Keates brings to life the `` olfactory cocktail '' that would assail the nostrils in a 17th-century playhouse . Meanwhile , Alyn taps into the latest scholarship about the genesis of this opera , often regarded as the first professional collaboration between librettist and composer . Dryden 's biographer , James Wynn , traces the origins of the collaboration between the two men in the preface to Dioclesian , which was signed by Purcell but written by Dryden , and explains that 17th-century authorship was a bit like the teams of writers on a present-day sitcom . In passing , the program considers the origin of the Knights of the Garter , the redecoration of Windsor Castle and the messy politics of Jacobites supporting the ousted James II versus William III 's Orange and Protestant sympathies . This provides the background to such remarkable musical treats as Purcell and Dryden 's Chorus Of Cold People , the paeon of praise to St George , and the best-known setting in the opera , `` Fairest Isle '' . With naked sylphs , ancient British battles and a drinking song worthy of the terraces at an England game , the program sheds new light on this most fascinating of operas . Andrew Carwood , regular guest conductor with the BBC Singers , presents an Early Music Show on the life and works of Eustache du Caurroy . Little is known about du Caurroy 's life , although it is thought that he served the French Royal court , under the reign of Charles IX , as a singer in the Royal Chapel . Once King Heny III came to the throne , du Caurroy was already a firm fixture in the royal music service , and he stayed there for the remainder of his career . By the end of the 16th century , he had gained wide recognition and esteem as a composer and teacher , and -- towards the end of his life -- accumulated several honors and benefices , including canonships in Dijon , Orleans , Bourg and Passy . The philosopher Marin Mersenne wrote of him : `` Du Caurroy reigns supreme for the great harmoniousness of his composition and his rich counterpoint ... all the composers of France hold him to be their master . '' Fine words for a composer who , it seems , is largely neglected today . BBC Radio 3 's New Generation Artists scheme exists to provide concert and recording opportunities for some of the finest young talent on the international music scene . This year , it celebrates 10 years of helping to establish and support the careers of stars such as Paul Lewis , the Belcea Quartet , Alison Balsom and Alice Coote . Throughout this summer 's BBC Proms season , BBC Radio 3 is broadcasting studio and concert performances by current members of the scheme , continuing tonight with the Pavel Haas Quartet , who perform the first quartet of their composer namesake . Also , Austrian mezzo-soprano Daniela Lehner performs Schumann 's Maria Stuart Songs -- settings of poetry supposedly written by the ill-fated Mary Queen of Scots during her incarceration . The treatment of love and death reflected Schumann 's own depression and illness at the time of writing this , his final song cycle . Argentinian pianist Ingrid Fliter performs Chopin 's Sonata No. 3 in B minor to round off this evening 's selection . Janek 's opera , The Cunning Little Vixen , was based on a newspaper comic-strip adventure , a story of forest-dwellers , both animal and human , and nature 's ever-turning circle of life and death . Some of Janek 's most engaging and luminous music was selected by Czech conductor Vaclav Talich and re-orchestrated to form this suite performed at the Royal Albert Hall by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales . Composer John McCabe celebrates his 70th birthday this year , and the Proms mark it with a performance of his Horn Concerto , commissioned by the BBC two years ago and performed by David Pyatt . Dvo k wrote his Ninth Symphony during a three-year stay in New York during the 1890s . He wrote the title , From The New World , himself , on the front page of his score . And , though Dvo k stopped short of using any actual American melodies , it is often said that spiritual song Swing Low , Sweet Chariot appears tantalisingly close to the flute in the first movement . Rainer Hersch , stand-up comedian and classical music specialist , remembers the brilliant and eccentric Gerard Hoffnung 's contribution to the comic side of classical music . Hoffnung , who died 50 years ago this month , was a cartoonist and wit whose mocking of the solemn rituals of classical music created a sensation in the Fifties . At a time when the symphony concert was , for the most part , a matter of great seriousness for music lovers , Gerard Hoffnung adored to see the funny side of those formalities . His famous cartoons took the instruments of the orchestra -- and the eccentricities of the people who played them -- and sent them up mercilessly . In 1956 , Hoffnung had the idea of translating the cartoons into real life . With a combination of realisations of his weird cartoon instruments and suitably eccentric compositions to showcase them , the first Hoffnung Music Festival took place at the Royal Festival Hall in London . Two further concerts followed -- around the time of Hoffnung 's untimely death at the age of 34 in 1959 . Later , the concerts were repeated for audiences around the world . For this program , Rainer Hersch delves into the BBC archives to discover Hoffnung and those who were part of those first concerts . On London 's South Bank , he encounters two musicians who had to grapple with these memorable , yet oddball , orchestral occasions . In Search Of The Holy Quail Three , like-minded , erudite men of the music world take a trip to Shetland , occasional home of the quail . The intrepid quail explorers are : Guy Garvey of Elbow ; BBC 6 Music presenter Martin Noble ; and BBC 6 Music presenter and ex-Fall member Marc Riley . The trio explore the rugged Shetland terrain and go in search of all manner of ornithological wonderment . The program follows the three rock-star twitchers on a journey from the city smoke all the way to Sumburgh Head on the southern tip of Shetland Mainland , to a traditional Shetland music session in a Lerwick pub and to Mousa Broch , one of the world 's largest Storm Petrel breeding colonies . Guillemots , arctic skuas and puffins are abundant , but can they find the elusive quail ? As there are no more than four seen in the Shetlands during a typical season , the chances of spotting one are slim . Presenters\\/Guy Garvey , Martin Noble and Marc Riley , Producer\\/John Leonard Peter Jukes 's play is a contemporary and offbeat thriller that takes listeners deep into the underworld of West London -- and beyond . Eliot is stuck in a rut . He 's a pizza delivery boy who is out of his depth with local loan sharks . When his friend Ron , a father figure and local drug don , is hospitalised with a critical heart condition , his parting gift to Eliot is his old mobile phone . `` Just wait for it to ring , '' he tells Eliot . And so it begins . Roy 's phone is a route to the big time . It thrusts Eliot into an underworld which is sometimes glamorous , often dangerous and always unexpected . The phone leads Eliot to an old flame , a new girlfriend , and eventually to a drop-off in Southern Spain . But the phone has also been bugged by the police and the drop-off is a set up . Only time will tell whether Eliot will walk away with the money , his freedom -- or even his life . The cast stars Freddy White as Eliot , Jemima Rooper as undercover cop Kathleen , Jimmy Akingbola as dodgy cabby Sparky and Richard Ridings as Roy . Peter Jukes is an established television writer , having penned such successful crime series as Sea Of Souls , In Deep , The Inspector Linley Mysteries and Waking The Dead . His recent BBC Radio 4 credits include Slavery , The Making Of , Soul Motel and Bad Faith . Presenter Robert Giddings explores the confrontation between creativity and fascism through the decisions made by five conductors . A famous photograph of a celebratory banquet at the Berlin Festival in the summer of 1929 shows a group of internationally distinguished conductors -- Bruno Walter , Arturo Toscanini , Otto Klemperer , Erich Kleiber and Wilhelm Furtwangler . Berlin in the Twenties had been a vibrant cultural and scientific European center and attracted world-class conductors who premired some of the most avant garde productions in Europe . However , as reactionary forces began more organised protests , particularly against opera and theater , tensions around artistic freedom of expression became heightened . The Berlin Festival of 1929 was a dazzling demonstration of the end of an epoch : not only did it feature German maestros Klemperer , Walter , Kleiber and Furtwangler , but it also attracted the entire company of La Scala from Milan under Toscanini . All five conductors were headstrong and often at loggerheads with administrators and fellow musicians . They all reacted strongly against totalitarianism and , in the Thirties , they found themselves in conflict with European fascism . Four of them looked elsewhere for the artistic freedom denied them by totalitarianism . However , Furtwangler stayed on in Nazi Germany , prompting questions about his political loyalties that still divide musicians , critics and fans today . Robert Giddings tells the stories of these five conductors through BBC archive recordings , including interviews with : Lotte Lehman ; Wagner 's daughter , Friedland ; Sir Adrian Boult ; George Solti ; and other significant figures in the European post-war music world .

John Dryden , director of The Day That Lehman Died On 15 September 2008 , Lehman Brothers , one of the oldest and largest investment banks in the world , with its headquarters in New York , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . It was the largest bankruptcy filed in US history and sent the already unstable global financial markets into an uncontrollable tailspin . This radio drama is a fictionalised account of events over the weekend prior to the bank 's demise . On Friday evening , Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , summoned 30 of the most powerful bankers on Wall Street to discuss the future of Lehman . It was put to the bankers that there would be no bail out from the US Treasury for the bank and that they themselves would need to devise a rescue plan , before the stock exchange opened on Monday morning . Under extreme pressure , the bankers argued and negotiated , all too aware that Lehman was not the only bank of its kind in trouble . This drama looks at how the critical decision was made to let Lehman die . Written by award-winning writer Matthew Solon , the play is directed by John Dryden . The drama was recorded , on location , in and around Wall Street . The Day That Lehman Died is part of Aftershock -- a new season of programs broadcast in September on the BBC 's International News Services -- BBC World Service , BBC World News and BBC.com -- investigating the impact of the global recession .

The Northern Sinfonia is joined by more than 200 young voices from across the UK and a distinguished cast of soloists , including Dominique Labelle and John Mark Ainsley . Presenter\\/Penny Gore , Producer\\/Juan Carlos Jaramillo George Mackay Brown is one of the most important Scottish poets of the 20th century . He believed that a poet was born , not made , and his gifts might either flourish or wither depending on circumstance . In his case he suspected that , had he grown up in a city , he might never have written a word . Instead , he lived in Orkney , and the islands for him became a `` place of order , a place of remembrance , a place of vision '' , which sustained him for the rest of his life . Poet Kenneth Steven travels to Stromness , where George Mackay Brown remained for almost his entire life , to speak to those who remember him and his influence in the community . Mackay Brown was not always in keeping with local sensibilities and felt at times an outsider in Orkney life . Yet it was the islands which sustained him , and this BBC Radio 3 Sunday Feature examines that complex relationship between writer and place . The program includes contributions from Sir Peter Maxwell Davies , who met George Mackay Brown on his first visit to Orkney and collaborated regularly with him in the following years . Sue MacGregor reunites people caught up in the siege at the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 , as BBC Radio 4 's The Reunion continues . The siege ended after six days when the Special Air Service dramatically stormed the building . The storming of the Embassy established both the SAS 's lethal reputation and that of Margaret Thatcher as a Prime Minister who refused to give in to terrorists . The siege began on 30 April 1980 when six men , armed with automatic weapons and grenades , overran the Embassy of the Islamic Republic Of Iran at Princes Gate , South Kensington , taking 26 people hostage . Within hours of the attack , the SAS counter-terrorism team was assembled close by . They built a replica of the five floor , 50-room building and began practicing their assault . `` As the days unfolded it was pure drama , a terrifying soap opera with all eyes glued to the Embassy 's front door , '' recalls the BBC 's Kate Adie , then a relatively unknown junior reporter who was camped out over the road opposite the Embassy . Joining Kate and Sue around the table are former hostages Sim Harris , who was seen crawling out the front window of the Embassy after the SAS went in ; Mustapha Kharkouti , who was thrown into the role of translator for the terrorists ; Max Vernon , one of the three specially trained police negotiators responsible for maintaining a dialogue with the terrorists ; and Robin Horsfall , an SAS commando , who took part in the rescue . Millions of people watched the rescue live on television , as bank holiday entertainment on all three channels was interrupted to show the real-life drama unfolding . This two-part drama , marking 300 years since the birth of Samuel Johnson , portrays the relationship between the poet , wit , pioneering lexicographer and king of Grub Street and his devoted fan , James Boswell . Starring Kenneth Cranham as Johnson , part one sees Boswell , played by Paul Higgins , traveling to London especially to seek out the great man . Boswell , 30 years Johnson 's junior , is in awe of the man : `` I can not help worshipping him ; he is so superior to other men . '' He determines to write a biography of Johnson and , encouraged by his hero , keeps journals of his conversations . Johnson is surrounded by leading artists and thinkers of the day such as Reynolds , Goldsmith , Burke , Garrick , Gibbon and Sheridan . When he paves the way for Boswell to join the `` club '' , the young man can not believe his luck . In part two , Boswell 's visits become more intermittent and Johnson meets Hester Thrale , wife of a wealthy brewer and MP . She becomes his devoted friend and confidante . When Hester 's husband dies , Johnson thinks she will turn to him , but she has fallen in love with an Italian opera singer and marries him instead . Johnson eventually sinks into a depression and dies ; and Boswell chides himself for not being a better friend . Barry MacSweeney wrote his first poem at the age of seven , endured a lifelong struggle with solitary hard drinking from 16 , and was nominated for the Oxford Poetry Chair at 18 . A protge of Northumbrian poet Basil Bunting , he was a regular at the legendary Morden Tower in Newcastle , along with Ted Hughes , Seamus Heaney , Allen Ginsberg and Ed Dorn . MacSweeney was a man of contradictions -- a romantic poet , a political journalist and an avid Newcastle United supporter ; vulnerable to harm , but raging against the world ; and an avant-garde writer , but also a naturalist whose writing was rooted in the Northumbrian landscape . His refusal to engage with the establishment was incompatible with commercial or mainstream success , and he died an alcoholic 's death on the poetry fringes . His work has inspired and galvanised a new generation of poets , who view MacSweeney as the lost icon of the counter-culture . To Tom Chivers , he is a hero of the avant-garde , and the man who inspired him to become a poet . A 16-year-old Tom encountered MacSweeney at a poetry reading . To his young fan , MacSweeney was terrifying , like a fictional villain , in a long black leather coat and tiny round glasses , and his performance was electric . It would be his last public reading . A week later he was dead . This is Tom 's personal journey to explore the man and the poet . Travelling to the Northumbrian landscape , the young poet and MacSweeney fanatic rediscovers his lost hero and investigates why his radical style was never palatable to the mainstream . He explores his appeal to a new generation of poets who are rediscovering MacSweeney , drawing from his idiosyncratic style and charismatic performances . He also finds out why , in a poetry scene that is once again revived with unusual use of language and an emphasis on the spoken word , MacSweeney is , for many young writers , the lost rebel who never sold out .

They are joined by guests and musicians along the way , including indie folk band Noah And The Whale , folk quartet The Unthanks , British Sea Power and singer-songwriter Richard Hawley plus other special guests . Presenters\\/Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie , Producer\\/Viv Atkinson Composer Of The Week -- Bernard Herrmann Ep 1\\/5 Monday 7 to Friday 11 September Bernard Herrmann referred to himself simply as a `` composer '' rather than a `` film composer '' . As far as he was concerned the distinction was an important one . He is best remembered for the brilliant film scores he produced , among them Citizen Kane ; the classic Hitchcock thrillers Psycho , North By Northwest , Marnie and Vertigo ; Truffaut 's fantastical Fahrenheit 451 ; and Martin Scorsese 's nightmarish Taxi Driver . He also wrote a cache of chamber , choral and symphonic music , as well as a full-length opera based on Emily Bront 's Wuthering Heights . By all accounts Herrmann was as complex as any of the characters his music illustrated on the silver screen . He could be paranoid , irascible , abrasive and volatile , yet he remained a romantic at heart . He could also be generous and compassionate but , as a perfectionist , perhaps his lot in life was never to be satisfied . Many of his professional disappointments resulted from his inability to compromise . Wuthering Heights was n't produced on stage in his lifetime because he would n't adjust the score . In the end , Herrmann paid for a recording of the complete work . It was the same story when it came to his symphony : written for the concert hall , the conductor Eugene Ormandy offered to program it for the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra with the proviso that Herrmann would agree to some cuts , one might guess Herrman 's answer . In this week 's Composer Of The Week , Donald Macleod explores a life full of contradictions and tensions that were never fully resolved . Suzy Klein introduces the final Chamber Prom this year from London 's Cadogan Hall , a tribute to Purcell in his 350th anniversary year , including a delightful sequence of his solo songs and keyboard pieces , concluding with his powerful Evening Hymn . In addition , John Blow 's Ode On The Death Of Mr Henry Purcell is a moving response to Purcell 's genius . Counter-tenor Iestyn Davies and tenor Simon Wall are joined by members of the Academy of Ancient Music , directed by Richard Egarr . This Prom will be repeated on Saturday 12 September at 2pm . Palestinian-Israeli pianist Saleem Abboud Ashkar is soloist in Mendelssohn 's youthful First Concerto , which the composer completed in just three days at the age of 22 . Mahler 's 10th Symphony was left unfinished at his death but was triumphantly premired at the 1964 Proms in a `` performing version '' prepared by musicologist Deryck Cooke and Berthold Goldschmidt . Written in the shadows of failing health and a collapsing marriage to his young wife , Alma , Mahler scribbled notes in the margins of the manuscript -- at one point he writes `` to live for you , to die for you '' and over the tender , peaceful ending , when he seems to have come to some resolution , he writes just one word `` Almschi '' -- his nickname for his wife . Sherlock Holmes is the subject of tonight 's Proms Literary Festival . Why are we still so fascinated by a pipe-smoking detective with a fondness for deductive reasoning ? He first appeared in 1887 , he 's thought to have been born around 1854 and those in the know believe he went to Cambridge , rather than to Oxford , before sharing a room in Baker Street with a certain Doctor Watson . He also had a famous love of the music of Mendelssohn . Presenter Matthew Sweet is joined at the Royal College of Music by the author of The Victorians , AN Wilson and Steven Moffatt , co-creator of the BBC 's forthcoming modern-day TV Sherlock . Book Of The Week -- William Golding : The Man Who Wrote The Lord Of The Flies Ep 1\\/5 Monday 7 to Friday 11 September This latest edition of Book Of The Week presents the first biography of the publicity shy author whose debut novel was rejected by many publishers before going on to sell more than 20 million copies in the UK alone . Drawing on a vast wealth of previously unpublished material in the Golding family archive , the writer and critic John Carey explores the life and career of the self-critical novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature . Carey 's biography examines Golding 's life and literary output in extensive detail , and draws heavily on a great deal of previously unpublished letters and journals . Listeners can learn about Golding 's early childhood ; his return to life as a provincial school teacher after being demobbed in 1945 ; the initial failure and subsequent success of his first novel , The Lord Of The Flies ; his frenetic and wildly successful tour of America in 1961 ; Golding 's largely fruitless attempts to research his Booker Prize-winning novel , Rites Of Passage ; and the controversy surrounding his award of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983 . Written and abridged by John Carey , Emeritus Merton Professor of English Literature at Oxford University and Chief Book Reviewer for The Sunday Times , William Golding -- The Man Who Wrote The Lord Of The Flies is read by Christian Rodska , one of radio 's most accomplished and distinctive voices . Monday 7 to Friday 11 September Anna Maxwell Martin and Sharon Gavin star in this week 's new Woman 's Hour Drama offering , written by David and Caroline Stafford . Alvy from Ireland and Dorika from Hungary -- both of whom speak excellent English -- are au pairs who meet every day at the One O'Clock Club : a drop-in mother-and-child center . They bond over their mutual condemnation of modern parenting and their feelings of injustice , and each gradually becomes entangled in both the intricacies of the other 's life and in the delusions , hypocrisies and moral turpitude of their employers . Gradually the lives of the girls and their employers are turned upside down . Dorika , in her initial wide-eyed innocent phase , wants comfort and security for her family back home on the farm , while Alvy wants money , sex and power -- and will probably get all three if she can stay out of jail . Alvy steers Dorika ruinously off the rails , but it is Dorika 's dark secret -- the existence of a handsome illegal-immigrant brother living secretly in her employers ' shed -- that ultimately leads to the breakdown of marriages , livelihoods , law , order and mental health . Alvy is played by Sharon Gavin and Dorika by Anna Maxwell Martin . Best Friends , today 's Afternoon Play offering , is written by Clara Glynn and stars Shonagh Price , Louise Ludgate and Robin Laing . When her best friend , Charlotte , is convicted of murder , Sam is determined to turn round what she believes is a miscarriage of justice -- after all , her friend is not the first mother to be wrongly imprisoned for killing her baby . When Charlotte 's new baby , Emily , dies suddenly at home everyone assumes it is a case of cot death . But , a few days later , Sam gets an early morning call from Charlotte to say she has been arrested and is being charged with murder . Sam is shocked but totally convinced that it is a terrible mistake and her friend is innocent . However , the case goes to trial and Charlotte is found guilty of Emily 's murder . Sam is determined to get her friend out of prison and to right this terrible miscarriage of justice . Sam works in PR and , with the approval of Charlotte 's husband , David , she mounts a campaign to free Charlotte . A new forensic report from a paediatric pathologist is commissioned in the hope it will uncover new evidence , possibly missed by the expert witnesses at the trial . But the new forensic report removes any doubts from the original police forensics . Sam wonders if Charlotte or her husband might be guilty of the crime , or if there is another explanation . As the truth unfolds Sam faces dilemmas which push her friendship with Charlotte to the limit . Sam is played by Shonagh Price , Charlotte by Louise Ludgate and David by Robin Laing . Five scientists look back to their ancient forebears and examine how much of that early knowledge still stands the test of time , in a new five-part series . In the first program , facial surgeon Iain Hutchison examines the earliest beginnings of nasal surgery . He discovers that the origins lie in a Sanskrit text attributed to Sushruta -- a physician or school of physicians -- working in third or fourth century BC on the banks of the river Ganges . At that time , cutting off the tip of the nose was a form of punishment and a clear badge of shame . Iain meets Sanskrit expert Dominik Wujastyk at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine to examine one of the early copies of the original text . He finds out that techniques used today using skin flaps from the cheek to reconstruct the nose were devised by Sushruta . However , it took centuries for this technique to reach Europe where methods were primitive by comparison . Other programs in the series explore early Egyptian systems of cooling and temperature control ; Aristotle 's writings on meteorology ; wound healing in Mesopotamian times ; and counting and early equations in Babylonian society . 11.00-11 .30 pm BBC RADIO 4 -LRB- Schedule update 28 August -RRB- In 1954 , an extraordinary erotic novel was published in Paris . The Story Of O told the tale of female submission and a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer , O , who is blindfolded , chained , whipped , branded , pierced , made to wear a mask and taught to be constantly available for intercourse . Written with an almost hallucinatory erotic intensity , in spare elegant prose , the purity of the writing took the literary world in France by storm and caused a sensation . The author , Pauline Reage , was a pseudonym and many people believed that because of the sexual intensity of the novel , the author could only have been a man . Rumours circulated for years as to the true identity of the writer , and the secret of exactly who Reage was only came to light in 1994 when British journalist John St Jorre went to interview the author . In this program , writer and former editor of the Erotic Review , Rowan Pelling , goes in search of Reage to find out exactly who she was and why she wrote such a deeply erotic -- and often disturbing -- novel . Rowan talks to people who knew her and discovers that Reage was , in fact , an impeccably dressed , demure intellectual called Dominique Aury and that she had written the novel as a love letter for her lover .

The series tests whether the spread of democracy and modern communications tools will really stop the endemic corruption , which continues to make too many people there among the poorest on Earth .

The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra 's permanent guest conductor , Garry Walker A long-time resident of the Orkney Islands , the master of The Queen 's Music , Sir Peter Maxwell Davies , celebrates his 75th birthday today by conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in Mendelssohn 's sea-sprayed Hebridean overture and the UK premire of his own new Violin Concerto -- inspired by traditional Orkney folk and fiddle music -- in tonight 's BBC Prom , live from London 's Royal Albert Hall . It was written for tonight 's soloist , Daniel Hope , and commissioned by Mendelssohn 's own orchestra , the Leipzig Gewandhaus , who recently gave the work 's premire .

Celebrating his 75th Birthday year , Sir Peter Maxwell Davies reflects on his career as a composer and conductor in an edited version of tonight 's Proms Plus conversation , hosted by Martin Handley . Completing the celebrations on the day of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies 's 75th birthday , David Hill directs the BBC Singers in a performance of two Davies 's most important choral works , in tonight 's late-night BBC Prom , live from London 's Royal Albert Hall . Westerlings imagines the early Norse settlers colonising Orkney in the 8th century . In one of the most virtuosic works in the entire choral repertoire , George Mackay Brown 's poems are set alongside wordless `` seascapes '' , creating an enormously atmospheric piece which vividly conjures up the cold and wet and other hardships endured by the settlers , rowing their longboats across the waters from Scandinavia . Sightings of whales and fish , waves and birds , culminate -- at landfall -- in a haunting setting of the Lord 's Prayer , sung in the Old Norse of ancient Orkney . Alongside this , listeners can hear another piece with powerfully Orcadian roots : Solstice Of Light , for chorus , organ and solo tenor , sung by Ed Lyon , which sets more words by Brown charting the whole history of the Orkney archipelago . It begins as the islands first emerge from seas and ice , then describes the prehistoric builders of cairns and stone circles , the Celtic men and women who bring a religion of dance and light , Viking marauders who murder the islands ' own saint -- Magnus -- and , finally , brings the story into our own times of those who would rape and despoil the Orkneys in search of the treasures of today -- oil , minerals and uranium .

Samuel Johnson , better known as Dr Johnson , was born in Lichfield in September 1709 . Half-blind , shambolic and poverty-stricken , he became the most admired and quoted man in the 18th century . In these three programs , specially commissioned to celebrate the tri-centenary of Johnson 's birth , David Nokes , Professor of English at King 's College London and author of a new biography of Johnson , introduces a series of extracts from the great man 's work .

Trevor Nelson features Stevie Wonder on his Soul Show this week Trevor Nelson 's Album Of The Week is Stevie Wonder 's 1976 masterpiece , Songs In The Key Of Life . Having showered Berry Gordy 's Motown label with chart gold dust throughout the Sixties , Wonder became influenced by the civil rights-related empowerment of black people in the USA and decided to make a stand through his music . His beliefs led to his creation of legendary songs such as Is n't She Lovely , I Wish , Sir Duke and As -- tracks that have inspired a generation of musicians . Critical discourse often labels the album `` experimental '' and this collection of funk , soul , fusion and pop requires an element of contextualization for this to be explored . Songs In The Key Of Life won four Grammys in 1978 , including Album Of The Year , and featured a wealth of talent , including George Benson , Herbie Hancock , Deniece Williams and Minnie Ripperton . The BBC Proms bicentenary salute to Mendelssohn ends with the BBC Symphony Orchestra , under Ji Blohlvek , performing the magical overture that Mendelssohn wrote at the age of just 17 , coupled with extracts from his later incidental music to Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream , live from London 's Royal Albert Hall .

Jenny Cuffe reports on the UK 's first family , drug and alcohol court -- a ground-breaking experiment designed to keep children of addicts from going into care .

Halfway through a three-year trial period for the court , Jenny hears from families , their lawyers , judges and the specialist team of counsellors . The system has proved successful in the US but Jenny explores whether it can work in the UK .

Each iconoclast will be tested by a panel of three expert witnesses and the audience is invited to join in the debate , as it 's happening , via texts and emails . This week , Ed and his guests ask whether the UK should stop trying to control immigration . Philippe Legrain has been a special adviser to the World Trade Organisation and an economics correspondent for The Economist . He 's a visiting fellow at the LSE and has published several books as well as many newspaper and magazine articles . He argues that no government , except perhaps North Korea 's , would dream of banning cross-border trade in goods and services , yet it is seen as perfectly reasonable for governments to try to ban the movement across borders of most people who produce goods and services . `` Immigrants are not an invading army , '' says Legrain , `` they are mostly people seeking a better life who are drawn to Europe by the huge demand for workers to fill the low-end jobs that our ageing and increasingly wealthy societies rely on , but which our increasingly well-educated and comfortable citizens are unwilling to take . '' Legrain 's views are challenged by Sir Andrew Green , Chairman Of Migrationwatch UK ; Ann Cryer , Labor MP for Keighley And Ilkeley ; and Tony Saint , former immigration officer-turned-writer . Also in this series , Ed and his panel of experts ask whether foreign aid does more harm than good and whether the age of consent should be lowered to 13 years old .

Mark Radcliffe explores the life of Violet Carson , the actress who played Ena Sharples , the Victorian relic who dominated Coronation Street in its golden age . A talented classical pianist and established BBC radio star , Carson was branching out into Shakespearian roles when she got the call from Granada to play the harridan in a hairnet . The genteel Carson became overshadowed by her character and claimed that Ena ultimately destroyed her . But she left a rich legacy -- Ena Sharples was television 's prototype battleaxe and became a touchstone for northern exiles like Melvyn Bragg , Roy Hattersley and Victoria Wood . Mark came across women like Ena in the brick mill terraces of Bolton where his grandparents lived . She epitomised a particular kind of woman , who dominated life in northern working-class communities . Contributors include Tony Warren , who not only devised Coronation Street but the character that shaped the series , and Geoffrey Wheeler , who worked with Carson at the BBC . He traces the quickfire delivery of Ena back to the northern music hall tradition . Melvyn Bragg talks about how Ena Sharples reflected life in the black and white world of the north in the Fifties , and scriptwriter Adele Rose discusses the pivotal relationship between Ena and her bete noir , Elsie Tanner . Listeners can also hear an archive recording of Carson reflecting on the mixed blessing that Ena Sharples became in her career and her life , as well as clips from early episodes of Coronation Street which demonstrate the quality of the writing and Carson 's talent as one of the best actresses of her generation . Paul Reynolds , Michael Fenton Stevens and Alex Tregear star in this Afternoon Play offering about the common cold , class warfare and Cliff Richard . Tony Bagley 's comedy is set in 1959 at the Common Cold Unit where , for almost 40 years , volunteers were `` given '' a cold by the staff , then had its effects studied in an attempt to find a cure . There was no shortage of applicants and people came back year after year . For some it was a free holiday ; they were unpaid but given `` pocket money '' . The heyday of the Common Cold Unit was in the post-war period . Despite the holiday atmosphere , volunteers got a stern lecture and were expelled if rules were broken or they lied about their medical history or age . Barry , a union official who likes the sound of his own voice , has been coming to the unit for years . When his room mate , John , is accused of breaking the 30ft rule , where volunteers are not allowed to get within that distance of anyone other than medical staff and room mates to avoid infection , he is asked to leave by his doctor . But Barry knows that John is innocent and goes into battle for him . It is soon obvious that Barry 's fight with the establishment may be as much to do with his own feelings of insignificance . Even if he does n't quite manage a revolution , he does get an apology out of the doctor , and he manages to attract the attentions of Lillian , another outsider at odds with the staff and her own room mate . Before long Barry breaks the 30ft rule himself , but with more pleasurable consequences .

In this edition of Assignment , Ed Butler examines the growing demand for reform of the world 's leading business schools . Some people , even within the major schools themselves , argue that they played a key role in providing the philosophical legitimacy and the education that led to the global financial crisis . Some of the complex financial instruments that are blamed for the credit crunch were devised by business school professors and until the last few years few , if any , of the major institutions made ethics a required part of their curriculum . One recent graduate from Harvard Business School describes a `` culture of arrogance and denial '' within its halls . While the schools themselves debate what changes they should make to their education system , the students themselves have launched an international student oath , aimed at promoting ethics among MBAs . But Assignment asks if anything will really change ? Aftershock is a new season of programs broadcast in September on the BBC 's International News Services -- BBC World Service , BBC World News and BBC.com -- investigating the impact of the global recession . Desmond Carrington -- After Seven English singer and entertainer Matt Munro From the table-top stage in an intimate nightclub to a full house at the London Palladium , Desmond Carrington looks at the careers of entertainers who wrote the rule book and created their own unique style . Under the spotlight this week is Matt Monro . Born in 1930 , Matt left school at 14 and began singing in public soon after . After completing his National Service in Hong Kong , Matt tried to make his way as a professional singer , taking a job as a bus driver to make ends meet . His break came when pianist Winifred Atwell heard him and introduced him to her record producer at Decca . That was the beginning of Matt 's rapid rise to stardom , and when EMI producer George Martin came into the picture in 1960 , Matt was swiftly guided to his first chart hit , Portrait Of My Love . This week 's Friday Night Is Music Night features a unique interpretation of Gustav Holst 's famous Planets Suite . Recorded at the Play The Field music festival in Somerset , the concert is presented and conducted by Charles Hazlewood and features his orchestra Excellent Device ! . Their performance of Holst 's stellar masterpiece will be interspersed with improvised electronic musical responses from the All Star band , which features Will Gregory from Goldfrapp and Adrian Utley from Portishead . Charles explains : `` In the gaps between the orchestra 's performance of each of the seven planets , my posse of sonic adventurers , the All Stars , will improvise spontaneous electronic responses using material sampled from what the orchestra have just played . It 's a highly original way of giving the audience a chance to revisit Holst 's material , but through a refracted lens , and with a contemporary twist . No one has ever attempted this before and I believe it will offer the audience a wonderful opportunity to climb even further inside the music . `` The extreme virtuosity of my symphony orchestra , Excellent Device ! coupled with the fact that the All Stars feature some of the most adventurous musicians around today , promises that this will be an unforgettable musical journey to the stars .

Presenter\\/Verity Sharp , Producer\\/Juan Carlos Jaramillo What Became Of The Bank Manager ? Clive Anderson , son of a bank manager Clive Anderson , the son of a bank manager , investigates the demise of the traditional face of our high street banks . For decades these reliable Captain Mainwarings kept everyone 's money safe ; were prominent in the Rotary Club ; and made it their business to know every detail of the local economy . Yet over the years , they were gradually phased out as cash machines and credit cards changed banking forever , and their risk-averse DNA stood at odds with the desire to `` sell , sell , sell '' . Clive goes in search of the reasons why his father 's profession no longer exists . He asks how this change reflects on consumer society today and the banking industry 's rush to lend money . In this program , Clive speaks to Duncan Bannatyne , multi-millionaire BBC TV Dragon whose branch bank manager set him on the road to a fortune ; Sid Brittin , a former old-style Lloyds bank manager who describes how he had a nervous breakdown under the pressure to meet new targets ; and John Hackett , HSBC 's Chief Operating Officer of Retail , who says banks are now far more responsive to their customers ' needs .

According to the affidavit , the LA chief coroner `` had reviewed the preliminary toxicology results and his preliminary assessment of Jackson 's cause of death was due to lethal levels of propofol '' . The documents go on to say that Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia . But , he said he had been concerned Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and had been trying to wean him off , using alternative drugs .

David Willis , BBC News , Los Angeles Michael Jackson had apparently been finding it difficult to sleep in the run-up to a series of comeback concerts in London . It was Michael Jackson himself who persuaded the company that was promoting his comeback tour to hire Dr Murray , a cardiologist by training , on a salary of more than a $ 150,000 a month . Dr Murray has acknowledged administering Propofol and Lorazepam on the day the singer died in an attempt to get him to sleep . Dr Murray has denied any wrongdoing but it will now be up to the District Attorney to decide whether to lay charges in this case . Dr Murray 's lawyer said the latest information `` contains nothing new '' and demanded that the coroner 's office release the full autopsy report . Edward Chernoff said he needed to know the exact levels of the various drugs in Jackson 's system and said the refusal to release the report suggested `` gamesmanship '' . `` One has to wonder why the coroner felt compelled to release anything at all if the police investigation is not yet complete , '' he said . Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia , according to an affidavit made public on Monday . The affidavit said Dr Murray had been giving Jackson propofol daily for six weeks but he was concerned that the singer was becoming addicted to the drug and had been trying to wean him off , using alternative drugs . Dr Murray told investigators he was not the first doctor to administer propofol to the star .

Conrad Murray insists he has done nothing wrong The last time Dr Murray administered the medication was 1040 on 25 June , just hours before Jackson 's heart stopped . Dr Murray is known to have performed CPR on his patient while paramedics were called , but Jackson was declared dead when he arrived at hospital . Police and federal agents have raided Dr Murray 's offices in Las Vegas , Nevada , and Houston , Texas , and a Las Vegas pharmacy that provided the drugs .

His weight was in the acceptable range for a man of his height , according to the Associated Press . But the singer , who died of a heart attack in June , had punctured arms , tattooed lips and eyebrows and suffered from lung damage and some arthritis . Jackson 's death was ruled as homicide caused by a powerful anesthetic . The Los Angeles coroner disclosed in August that Propofol and the sedative Lorazepam were the `` primary drugs responsible for Mr Jackson 's death '' . The drugs were administered by Jackson 's physician Dr Conrad Murray , and the verdict has been considered likely to increase the chances of criminal charges being brought against his doctors . According to the document , Jackson 's most serious health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs , but this was not serious enough to be a contributing factor to his death . The post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may have limited Jackson 's ability to perform . `` His overall health was fine , '' said Dr Zeev Kain of the University of California , who reviewed the report for AP but was not involved in the post-mortem examination . `` The results are in normal limits , '' he added . The report also revealed that Jackson had a number of scars on his body , including behind his ears and beside each of his nostrils . Dr Kain concluded they were likely to have been caused by cosmetic surgery , while others , including on the knee , were likely to have been created by medical procedures . The document also states that the singer was bald at the front of his head and had what appeared to be a dark tattoo stretching across his head . His remaining hair was described as short and tightly-curled , it added . The coroner reported that Jackson had depigmentation of the skin around his face , chest , abdomen and arms . The full autopsy report has yet to be officially released to the public , but the conclusion that Jackson 's death was homicide has been disclosed .

World Routes -- An Appalachian Road Trip Fifty years after Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins traveled through the American south , documenting its unique personalities and music , writer and musician Banning Eyre embarks on his own Appalachian road trip to discover the American folk music that was born there in the 18th and 19th centuries . He visits the small town of Mount Airy in Surry County , North Carolina , where he meets the extraordinary players and singers keeping this music alive , and finds out how `` old time '' music is the direct precursor of what is now called country and bluegrass . In an interview with musician and field recordist Mike Seeger , recorded just a few months before he died , Banning discovers the roots of the music in the parallel histories of the European settlers and African slaves . He finds out how , post-emancipation , a distinctly American music was forged from the interplay of the African banjo and the European fiddle . Banning then embarks on a cross-state journey to hear the music and the stories of some of the older players and singers who can trace a direct line back to before the age of the radio and gramophone , to when this music was a strictly oral tradition . Banning meets 90-year-old fiddler Jo Thomson -- perhaps the only known surviving old time , African-American stringband player . His playing and stories capture a period of time before the music was delineated on race grounds . Banning also meets eighth-generation ballad singer Sheila Kay Adams .

He compares programs , over a series of anniversary dates , to see what changes and what remains the same . The Second World War provides a vivid example .

In this two-part documentary Tim Gardam , Principal of St Anne 's College , Oxford , confronts the response to death in 21st-century Britain . He reflects on how people deal with death as a society and considers the relationship between those who have gone and those who are left behind . Most people can remember their first funeral . Everyone can remember the first time they saw someone who had died . But how we respond to death and our own mortality varies greatly in multi-cultural Britain . In the first program , Tim meets two teenagers who created their own ritual for their friend Dan , who died suddenly in a road accident . He hears from a 70-year-old Hindu who is challenging British law in order to secure the right to have an open funeral pyre in the UK when he dies . And Tim encounters death first-hand when he joins with a Muslim family at their ritual washing and burial of their father\\/grandfather which traditionally takes place within 24 hours of death . In the second program he finds out that people often go far beyond a lock of hair or piece of jewellery as a keepsake of a loved one . Tim attends the National Funeral Exhibition and encounters an industry where physical immortality is now marketed as a desirable commodity to those who have lost their belief in life after death , but who are terrified of oblivion .

The recording captures the moment when he was found by his colleagues , miraculously unscathed . John Hurt narrates this two-part adaptation of EM Forster 's classic , Howards End .

The short-lived romance comes to an end but Helen 's elder sister Margaret forms an uncomfortable but genuine bond with Mrs Wilcox , who is ill and dies . The late Mrs Wilcox had scribbled a last request that her beloved house , Howards End , be left to Margaret Wilcox . The family , however , has disregarded and destroyed this note . Howards End is a timeless story concerned with relationships and the possibility of reconciliation between pairs of opposites : the prose and the passion , the practical mind and the intellect , the outer life and the inner .

Benny Goodman performing with the Pro Arte Orchestra in 1964 American singer\\/songwriter and musician Curtis Stigers celebrates the centenary of clarinet virtuoso and band-leader Benny Goodman , born on 30 May 1909 , in a new , six-part series , written by Russell Davies . For generations , Goodman was known to the world as The King Of Swing -- a title awarded to him in the Thirties -- but he was much more than that . Goodman was one of the finest clarinet players in the world and practiced his art at the highest levels in both jazz and classical music . He was a band-leader who strove for , and achieved , perfection through tireless rehearsals of the various jazz ensembles he created over the decades . He was also a driven and complex man . Despite the fact that he died more than two decades ago , in 1986 , stories of his unpredictable behavior are legendary . This series features new interviews with jazz critic Gary Giddins ; Professor Dan Morgenstern of the Institute for Jazz Studies at Rutgers University ; clarinettist and saxophonist Ken Peplowski ; Loren Schoenberg , executive director of the Jazz Museum in Harlem ; singer Louise Tobin ; Sir John Dankworth ; and writer John Hancock .

Debussy 's heady portrait of a sultry sun-infused afternoon of a faun is considered one of the key works of musical history , as tonality loosens its grip among the mythical glades of nymphs , naiads and fauns . Stravinsky 's The Rite Of Spring is also a seminal work and Debussy -- who premired the four-hand piano version with the composer -- was a great admirer of the younger man 's piece , admitting that the Rite haunted him `` like a beautiful nightmare '' . Rachmaninov 's Piano Concert No. 2 -- made famous by its use in the soundtrack to Brief Encounter -- is performed by Russian pianist Vadim Rudenko . It was composed in 1900 after a period of severe writer 's block , which was only overcome after Rachmaninov began a course of auto-suggestive therapy with psychologist Nikolai Dahl , to whom the concerto is dedicated . This is followed by the start of a week of performances given by the Northern Sinfonia , ahead of BBC Radio 3 's Free Thinking Festival , which takes place at The Sage , Gateshead , from 23-25 October . Book Of The Week -- Blaze Of Obscurity Ep 1\\/5 Monday 19 to Friday 23 October Clive James reads from his fifth volume of memoirs -- The TV Years -- in this new Book Of The Week offering , which covers his most prominent period on TV . For many people , Clive James will always be a TV presenter first and foremost , and a writer second , despite the fact that his adventures with the written word took place before , during and after his time on the small screen . Nevertheless , for those who remember clips of Japanese endurance game shows and Egyptian soap operas ; Clive reinventing the news or interviewing Hefner and Hepburn , Polanski and Pavarotti ; Clive 's `` Postcards '' from Kenya , Shanghai and Dallas ; or Clive James Racing Driver , Clive 's rightful place does seem to be on the box .

Vhari Burnett is a top lawyer , but that has n't stopped her from being beaten up , or so it seems . When her partner opens the door he claims there has been a misunderstanding . The next day , Vhari is found dead . Driven by her nose for a story and wracked by guilt at her own apparent complicity , Paddy 's investigations reveal two middle-class sisters caught up in a world of violence , drug-dealing and East End gangs .

Normally this would n't be the most taxing of trials , but Max and sister Katrin have rarely seen eye to eye . Ever since he broke the neck of her parrot when they were children , they 've gone from spat to spat . However , for the last five years , Max has somehow managed to keep himself in check . Now , with only two weeks to go until judgement day , surely nothing can go wrong .

Monday 19 to Friday 23 October Award-winning historian Professor Amanda Vickery continues to present a history of private life in Britain over 400 years , and this week focuses on the 18th century -- exploring servants , bachelors , spinsters , widows and widowers . Many servants did n't have a bed of their own and slept in passageways or across their masters ' doors -- like guard dogs . Maids , meanwhile , were notoriously vulnerable to sexually predatory men . In Tuesday 's program , Professor Vickery explores the life of a bachelor in the 17th and 18th centuries . Living outside the family embrace was far from glamorous before the advent of washing machines , microwaves and pre-prepared meals for one . Bachelorhood was supposed to be a temporary and unprestigious state best solved by marriage . This program tells the poignant and amusing story of law student Dudley Ryder , and his search for a wife . Wednesday 's program explores the lives of spinsters and reveals that one in five women never married . Thursday 's program , meanwhile , shows that the lives of widows were very different from spinsters . Widows had enormous status and power and , for some , the death of a spouse was a fairy-tale release . This program tells the story of one of England 's richest widows and how she spent her fortune . The final program of the week tells the story of two different widowers and their search for a new wife . This is original material from two unusual sets of diaries which Professor Vickery found in Lincoln . One widower was a surgeon , while the other a solicitor -- a man tortured by guilt because of his relationship with his housekeeper , who he is unable to stop sleeping with .

Nana has sung on all the great stages of the world , but her success has not come without a price .

Nana reflects on the struggles and triumphs of her career , and we hear from many stars of the music world who played significant roles in her life and career , including Michel Legrand , Harry Belafonte , Charles Aznavour and Quincy Jones . Presenter\\/Michael Aspel , Producers\\/Lisa Meyer and Brian King Michael Buerk interviews people who have made life-altering decisions and talks them through the whole process , from the original dilemma to living with the consequences . In this week 's edition of The Choice , Michael talks to Father Aidan Troy , the Catholic priest who played a central role in supporting the pupils of Holy Cross School , Belfast , during protests over their right to walk to school in 2001 . Antony Gormley , one of Britain 's leading artists , pays tribute to the sculptor Jacob Epstein on the 50th anniversary of his death . Epstein attracted criticism during his career , his work was often seen as being too graphic or hard hitting , too ugly or cannibal . After his death , fellow sculptor , Henry Moore paid tribute to his courage as a pioneering artist who bore the brunt of critical derision . Fifty years on , Anthony shows how Epstein revived British sculpture in crucial ways : how he sought inspiration from the ancient , non-Western cultures of Egypt , China and Africa , and how he insisted on `` direct carving '' , where he worked out his ideas straight into the stone . Born on the East Side of New York City in 1880 to Jewish immigrant parents , Jacob Epstein moved to Paris in 1902 , where he absorbed the work of Rodin and saw ancient Egyptian sculpture in the Louvre . He moved to London in 1905 , immediately feeling at home and becoming a British subject . His first significant commission came in 1907 , when he carved 18 figures for the British Medical Association Building in the Strand . Completed the following year , these pieces solidly established the young sculptor 's reputation -- he had numerous private commissions for portraits throughout his career . At this time , Epstein 's passion for direct carving in his own work becomes evident and his subject matter is devoted to major human themes and a search for the primordial , archetypal image . From modest beginnings in Paris , his keen interest in African sculpture grew and he amassed one of the finest collections of African art in Britain . Writer Irma Kurtz sets off on a journey to Paris and Madrid to investigate the period just before the war when blind Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo composed his famous Concerto de Aranjuez . The concerto , one of the most famous pieces of classical music , was written 70 years ago . Although Rodrigo could n't play the instrument , Spain 's guitar traditions and rhythms are ever present in the music . Many people particularly love the middle movement , `` Adagio '' . Rodrigo said he wanted to evoke `` the fragrance of magnolias '' , `` the song of birds and the gushing of fountains '' . Irma analyses how place and time affected the composition and also offers a psychological analysis of the composer 's life in pre-wartime Paris and Madrid and how his make-up can be heard in his music . Irma , who has lived in both Spain and Paris , has long had a fascination for Rodrigo 's music . She travels to Paris and Madrid to talk to Rodrigo 's family , including his daughter Cecilia Rodrigo , the eminent guitarist Pepe Romero and Henri Heugel of the Ecole Normale de Musique in Paris , where Rodrigo studied . Irma also visits the family home in Madrid and the gardens at Aranjuez . Irma 's journey through 1939 Paris and Madrid with Rodrigo 's daughter will evoke the context of the writing of one of the best-loved pieces of classical music .

The most important beneficiaries include soft fruits like strawberries and blueberries , so much so that Scottish fruit growers are importing bumblebee nests from Holland to counteract the decline .

Dr Conrad Murray 's legal team says it expects him to be charged with involuntary manslaughter . The announcement came shortly before the doctor had planned to surrender himself at a Los Angeles courthouse . Details of charges will be officially released Monday , the LA district attorney 's office said . Involuntary manslaughter occurs when a death is the indirect result of negligence or recklessness . Jackson died at his Los Angeles home on 25 June aged 50 . His death was ruled as homicide , mainly caused by the powerful anesthetic Propofol . Several drugs were found in Michael Jackson 's body A cocktail of drugs - including sedatives Midazolam and Diazepam , the painkiller Lidocaine and the stimulant Ephedrine - were also detected in his body a coroner confirmed . Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson Propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia , according to an affidavit made public in August . But he has always maintained he did not prescribe nor administer anything that should have killed the singer . The legal wrangling comes after several days of negotiations where his lawyers have tried to arrange for Dr Murray to surrender to prosecutors , in an attempt to avoid him being handcuffed and arrested . `` It seems ridiculous to us that it 's been dragging on this long '' , Dr Murray 's defense team spokeswoman Miranda Sevcik was quoted as saying by AP . `` To us this is showmanship and we are just done '' , she added .

Dr Conrad Murray was bailed for $ 75,000 -LRB- # 48,000 -RRB- after pleading not guilty to `` unlawfully , and without malice , killing Michael Joseph Jackson '' . A judge must decide whether to proceed to trial . A conviction could bring a jail term of up to four years . Jackson died at his home on 25 June last year at the age of 50 . His death was ruled as homicide , mainly caused by the anesthetic Propofol . A cocktail of drugs - including sedatives midazolam and diazepam , the painkiller lidocaine and the stimulant ephedrine - were also detected in his body , a coroner confirmed . Members of the Jackson family arrive at court for Dr Murray 's hearing Prosecutors had filed one count of involuntary manslaughter . Dr Murray stood straight and spoke softly as he addressed the judge . After entering his plea , Dr Murray surrendered his passport . He was then taken to have his fingerprints and a mugshot processed . He is allowed to continue to practice medicine , but can not use certain drugs . Judge Keith Schwartz told Dr Murray : `` You may not under any circumstances use any anesthetic agents , specifically Propofol . `` You are not to be using that , you 're not to prescribe that , you 're not to have it in any manner whatsoever ... and you are not to give any other heavy sedative medications like that . '' The bail of $ 75,000 was three times the standard figure for involuntary manslaughter , but a quarter of the sum prosecutors had been seeking . The next hearing has been set for 5 April . Members of Michael Jackson 's family - father Joe , mother Katherine , brothers Jermaine , Tito , Jackie and Randy and sister LaToya - were in court for the hearing . When asked by a reporter as he arrived what he thought about Dr Murray being charged with involuntary manslaughter , Jermaine said simply : `` It 's not enough '' . Joe Jackson said only `` looking for justice '' . A lawyer for the family , Brian Oxman , speaking to CBS television , said of the involuntary manslaughter charge : `` I do n't think it would satisfy anybody , the millions of fans around the world . '' A number of the singer 's fans had shouted `` justice for Michael '' as Dr Murray arrived at court . Mark Lester , who is godfather to one of Michael Jackson 's children , told the BBC 's Newshour someone should be punished . `` At the end of the day it 's not going to bring Michael back . There has to be some punishment meted out if only to prevent a further occurrence of this happening . `` It 's just the most horrible , horrible scenario . There are no winners here . '' Dr Murray had been hired to be Jackson 's personal physician last spring as the singer prepared for his comeback concerts in London . We 'll make bail , we 'll plead not guilty and we 'll fight like hell But he has always maintained he neither prescribed nor administered anything that should have killed the singer . After a week of speculation over the manslaughter charge , Dr Murray had been expected to surrender to authorities last Friday . But a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorney said the office had decided to delay action until Monday . The statement came after several days of negotiations , where Dr Murray 's lawyers tried to arrange for him to surrender to prosecutors in an attempt to avoid him being handcuffed and arrested . Dr Murray was not handcuffed as he arrived in court . Speaking before the charges were filed , the physician 's defense lawyer , Ed Chernoff , said the doctor was prepared for the legal battle ahead . `` We 'll make bail , we 'll plead not guilty and we 'll fight like hell , '' he said . The charge follows months of careful investigation , with prosecutors said to be keen to avoid an unsuccessful high-profile prosecution like that of former football star OJ Simpson . Originally from Grenada , Dr Murray moved to the US and trained as a doctor . In 2000 , he opened his own practice in Las Vegas , expanding with a second clinic in Houston in 2006 . However , he encountered financial difficulties and reports suggest he filed for bankruptcy in 2002 while living in California . Jackson hired the physician on a salary of more than $ 150,000 -LRB- # 96,000 -RRB- a month in May 2009 .

Miranda Sevcik , a spokeswoman for Dr Murray and Mr Chernoff , said the doctor was making arrangements to work out of another physician 's office in Las Vegas , having closed his own premises in the city last August . `` We 're not sharing the location because the doctor 's primary concern is for his patients ' privacy , '' said Sevcik .

They lend their distinctive voices to a dozen folk songs drawn from rural Appalachian and Anglo-American musical idioms on their recently released album . Bob also plays Natalie Merchant 's final acoustic session track . Mention the songs of Hugo Wolf and the one likely reaction is to find them humorless , dense and difficult . Yet his songs can be biting or tender , funny or sad , erotic or esoteric and as immediately appealing as anything by Schubert or Schumann . With performances of Wolf 's songs by Fischer-Dieskau , Elly Ameling , Ian Bostridge and Barbra Streisand among others , BBC Radio 's 3 resident song-lover Iain Burnside traces Wolf 's life and aims as a composer through his varied song collections . He is joined by fellow Wolf enthusiasts Graham Johnson , Susan Youens , Amanda Glauert and Jeremy Sams . Burnside examines how Wolf 's sense of humor made him as many friends as enemies ; how Wagner was both an ardent inspiration and a curse on Wolf 's career ; how Bizet 's opera , Carmen , brought a new clarity of vision to Wolf 's late song collections ; and how the richness and sophistication of Wolf recordings past may be inhibiting the appreciation of Wolf today .

Lenny Henry plays Othello in Northern Broadsides ' production Featuring Lenny Henry in the title role , the Saturday Play is the acclaimed Northern Broadsides stage production of Othello . Lenny won the Best Newcomer in the 2009 Evening Standard Theatre Awards for his performance . His performance is the culmination and a direct result of Lenny 's exploration of Shakespeare on previous BBC Radio 4 programs . Lenny plays the brave and noble Othello who allows himself to be duped by the evil and manipulative Iago into thinking his wife is unfaithful . His descent from majestic dignity to deluded rage , culminating in the murder of his virtuous and innocent wife , is the great tragedy at the heart of the play . Iago , the treacherous puppet master who skilfully manipulates the action of the play , fooling everyone into believing he is honest , yet planting suspicions wherever he goes , is played by Conrad Nelson .

From Falstaff at the Boar 's Head to John Self at the Shakespeare in Martin Amis 's Money , English literature and the pub are intertwined . Robert Hanks presents an elegy for pubs in literature , and an exploration of what the smoking ban , the gastro pub and the five quid pint are going to do to writing . For some writers , the pub has been the emblem of a hearty , democratic brand of Englishness : Hogarth 's wholesome Beer Alley , as opposed to sordid Gin Lane ; Dickens in the 19th century ; and , in the 20th , Wells , Chesterton , Belloc , Orwell , Kingsley Amis and even JK Rowling . For other writers , pubs have been refuges for the seedy and desperate : Patrick Hamilton , Julian Maclaren-Ross and the George Orwell of Coming Up For Air . Pubs have provided the settings for storytellers : PG Wodehouse 's Mr Mulliner holding court at the Angler 's Rest ; Arthur C Clarke 's band of scientists competing to see who can tell the tallest tale at the White Hart ; and , in TS Eliot 's The Waste Land , the pub became a place haunted by death and apocalypse . Pubs have also been the places where writers have met , to talk about writing , or to forget about it : Johnson and Boswell at the Mitre in Fleet Street ; CS Lewis , JRR Tolkien and the other Inklings at the Eagle And Child in Oxford ; Dylan Thomas and Julian MacLaren-Ross at the Wheatsheaf in Rathbone Place , Fitzrovia ; Louis MacNeice at the George ; and Jeffrey Bernard and many others at the Coach And Horses in Soho . Robert Hanks taps some old archival barrels and discusses the pub , using drama and readings archive , as well as old interviews and a few new ones . The program also considers the changing nature of the pub and whether there is any room there for the writer in the age of 24-hour drinking , quizzes and chain-pubs . 12.00noon-7 .20 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents an action-packed afternoon of live sport , starting with commentary on Chelsea versus Manchester City , live , from Stamford Bridge at 12.45 pm .

Quickly married off , the nave princess finds herself admired and taunted by those around her . And , while they gossip cruelly , she becomes helplessly and dangerously caught up in matters of love . Playfully adapted , this radio dramatisation offsets the princess 's painful conflict between duty and love with characters who delight in the wickedness of their world . Marybeth Hamilton tells the story of the invention of ethnographic fieldwork by Bronislaw Malinowski in the early years of the 20th century , and how living with the people being studied became a guiding tenet of all anthropology . Malinowski stumbled into a prolonged stay in the Pacific almost by accident and wrote private diaries that some have thought jeopardised his more scholarly findings . But his studies -- appearing at the same time as Freud was writing and literary modernism was changing how the world was perceived -- have retained their value , and his fieldwork methods have spread into a host of creative and intellectual pursuits .

At the Aberdeen Maritime Museum , Richard is shown a boat-shaped altar , where families of sailors would pray for their safety . Religion has played an important part in sea-faring towns ; however , in Robin Hood 's Bay in North Yorkshire , folk singers Mike and Norma Waterson talk about pagan rituals and a reverence for the sea god Oceana , which was common among sailors . Richard discovers that it 's not just pagan gods and the Christian God who play a huge part in the lives of sailors and people who live on the coast . In Cornwall and Devon he hears stories about mermaids and selkies and other mythical sea creatures and monsters that feature heavily in folk songs and stories in coastal towns . Finally , in Glasgow , he speaks to Belle And Sebastian 's Stuart Murdoch about some of the most important fantasy novels written about life on the ocean and how the idea of going to sea has inspired some of the UK 's most important novelists . This episode also features contributions from Soft Machine 's Robert Wyatt , poet Simon Armitage , Jon Boden from Bellowhead and folk singer Christina Stewart . Monday 1 to Friday 5 March Donald Macleod explores Frederic Chopin 's time at Nohant , the country retreat of his lover George Sand , where over seven long summers towards the end of his life he composed much of his finest music including , in today 's program , his mazurkas Op 41 and his second piano sonata , which shocked contemporary audiences . Chopin first met writer George Sand in Paris in 1836 . He was , as ever , impeccably turned out , down to his trademark white kid gloves . She was smoking a cigar and dressed in men 's clothing . She struck him as extraordinary , even repellent but a year later , perhaps bruised from having had a marriage proposal rejected , he reacted quite differently . They appear to have become lovers by June 1838 , and spent seven summers together at Sand 's manor house at Nohant , some 150 miles south of Paris . Nohant was an important element in the chemistry of the relationship between Chopin and Sand -- a real blessing , since Chopin found it impossible to concentrate on composition among all the dizzy distractions of Paris . In this bucolic oasis , `` the little one '' , as Sand called him , produced much of his greatest work . This week , Donald Macleod lingers in Nohant 's spacious rooms , looking out at the surrounding parkland , or wandering among its trees , telling stories of the strange relationship between the two and listening to the music that Chopin composed here . A week of concerts featuring Scottish music ensembles begins with Stphane Den ve conducting the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in works by Berlioz , Respighi and Guillaume Connesson . Stphane Den ve , musical director of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra since 2005 , has a great affinity with music from his native France and this program includes two contrasting French works -- the exhilarating and flamboyant showpiece for orchestra , Berlioz 's Roman Carnival Overture ; and the equally dazzling work by the young French composer Guillaume Connesson called A Glimmer In The Age Of Darkness , which the orchestra premired in 2005 . The color and drama of both these works , using the full scope of this large symphony orchestra , is matched in Respighi 's masterpiece from his Roman Trilogy , The Pines Of Rome -- as grand an image of the great city as one can imagine painted with a huge range of percussion , brass , bells , celeste and organ and brass . Russian pianist Nicolai Lugansky joins the orchestra to play Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto -- on a smaller scale , but equally dynamic in its own way . Lugansky made his name overnight when he won the 1994 Tchaikovsky Piano Competition and has built a formidable international reputation for his interpretations . The concert is recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall -- the regular venue for the RSNO in Glasgow . Philip Dodd reviews Tim Burton 's much-anticipated imagining of Lewis Carroll 's classic fantasy , Alice In Wonderland , and looks at Don DeLillo 's new novel , Point Omega . Burton has carved a niche as cinema 's foremost purveyor of the gothic through films such as Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd . Philip finds out how Carroll 's classic has fared under its Burton makeover . Don DeLillo 's new novel is about a meeting of two men and one woman . One is Richard Elster , a scholar and US Government war advisor . For two years he has tried to make intellectual sense of troop deployments , counter-insurgency orders and secret renditions of US foreign policy , but has now retreated to an isolated house in the desert . There he is joined by Jim Finley , a young film-maker intent on documenting his experience . The two men talk and drink and are then joined by Elster 's daughter Jessie , who dramatically alters the dynamic . When a devastating event follows , all the men 's talk and the accumulated meaning of conversation and isolation are thrown into question . Pianist and broadcaster Piers Lane looks at five aspects of Frederic Chopin 's life and music to celebrate 200 years since the composer 's birth . Drawing on extracts from Chopin 's own writing , and those who have written about him over the past two centuries , Piers looks at the myths , interpretations and veneration surrounding one of the most universally adored pianist\\/composers . Chopin 's name is synonymous with ideas of romance and melancholy . In this first program , Piers explores how , despite being labeled as the archetypal Romantic pianist , Chopin resisted much of what is now associated with 19th-century Romantic piano music -- the overt scene painting and descriptive title of his contemporaries such as Liszt , Berlioz or Schumann . Later in the week , Piers looks at how the composer innovated form and style on the piano , the instrument on which he focused so exclusively ; Chopin 's often overlooked role as one of the most sought-after teachers in Paris ; his composing process and interpretations of his music ; and the veneration from audiences and other composers that has always surrounded him . BBC Radio 3 presenter Jez Nelson Jez Nelson presents a giant of jazz , American saxophonist Joe Lovano , in concert at Ronnie Scott 's . Joe Lovano weaves together jazz past , present and future with his acclaimed quintet Us Five , featuring James Weidman on piano , bassist Esperanza Spalding and drummers Otis Brown and Francesco Mela . Born in Ohio to a musical family in 1952 , Joe rose to prominence during the Eighties playing with John Scofield 's quartet and Paul Motion 's bass-less trio with Bill Frisell . Since then he has led many of his own groups , developing a tone that combines Stan Getz 's breathy melodic style and John Coltrane 's gruffness with a deep-seated knowledge of jazz composition . Monday 1 to Friday 5 March In 1967 , a chance meeting between Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe led to a romance and a lifelong friendship that sustained them as they sought and found phenomenal artistic success . They made a pact to always care for each other and to devote themselves to art . Creatively , their paths would diverge . Patti set her poems to music and became a rock 'n' roll star . Robert became a brilliant and controversial photographer . But from time to time their paths intersected , most memorably in the photo shoot for the cover of Patti 's first album , Horses . Written and read by Patti Smith , Just Kids paints an extraordinary portrait of cultural New York from the late Sixties to the mid-Seventies . The story takes in Brooklyn , the Chelsea Hotel , Max 's Kansas City , Scribner 's Bookstore , Coney Island and Andy Warhol 's Factory . Their paths cross with musicians and artists including Bobby Neuwirth , Janis Joplin , Jimi Hendrix , Allen Ginsberg , Sam Shepherd and William Burroughs . In this explosive political and artistic climate , two young artists keep each other going through the hunger , days of filched steaks , cous-cous and lettuce soup . Monday 1 to Friday 5 March Beyond Black is a 10-part dramatisation of Hilary Mantel 's blackly comic novel about a professional medium with a troubled past , traveling around the seedy halls of suburban England with her sceptical assistant . Alison Hart is an awkward , obese , disorganised woman , but with a gift for empathy and a good platform technique . Her familiar spirits are figures from her chaotic childhood , principal among them a small , foul-mouthed circus performer with disgusting personal habits called Morris , who is her unpleasant and bitter spirit guide . Alison plies her trade in the dormitory towns just beyond the outskirts of London , acting as a channel between the sad and credulous living and the clamorous dead . To try to create some order in her messy existence , she takes on an assistant , the highly efficient but essentially heartless Colette , who , although she is a regular witness to Alison 's gift , is nevertheless a profoundly sceptical companion . The two of them are bound together by a need that neither wants to recognize . As they travel from one psychic fair , community hall or pub function room to another , they are accompanied by the vulgar , belching Morris -- invisible to Colette but occasionally identified by a whiff of sewage in the air . And Morris has friends , a violent gang of petty thieves among whom Alison grew up , who abused her as a child and who continue to haunt her now they are dead . Only by recognizing and confronting her demons can Alison banish them -- but the dead are persistent , and before Alison can find peace , she has to face up to the memories of her damaged past . Beyond Black , by Man Booker 2009 winner Hilary Mantel , was shortlisted for the Orange Prize in 2006 , and is one of her best-selling and most discussed books . It stars Alison Steadman as Alison , Rosie Cavaliero as Colette , Bill Wallis as Morris , Simon Armstrong as Aitkenside and June Barrie as Mrs Etchells . India 's economy has expanded at a phenomenal rate over the last 10 years and Indians have been making their mark all over the world . Educated in English at the best establishments in India and abroad , this confident and outward-looking elite can now be found in countless top executive roles in multinational corporations and as global entrepreneurs . This three-part series asks what makes them so successful . The first program looks at the new confidence among the fast-expanding middle-class and explores the successes of the wealthiest ethnic group in the United States , especially in Silicon Valley where their technical and entrepreneurial prowess has been particularly remarkable . Many of the IT products used every day were developed by Indians . Presenter\\/Mukti Jain Campion , Producers\\/Mukti Jain Campion and Chris Eldon Lee When writer Jim Eldridge visited Antarctica three years ago , he was struck by the international efforts being made to keep the continent in pristine condition . In contrast to the rubbish dump it nearly became in the Seventies , no one is now allowed to leave anything there or take anything away -- not so much as a stone or a feather . Jim 's new play , Ashes To Antarctica , tells the story of Jill Foster , a woman who is determined to scatter her husband 's ashes on the ice , as a memento of his work with the British Antarctic Survey years ago . But she meets with the opposition of one of the scientists on her expedition , Chilean Dr Emilie Prado , who befriends her and works to convince her that she would be doing the wrong thing . The play follows a personal journey as Jill Foster and her sister Liz travel on a tourist ship from South America through the Antarctic islands to the continent itself . Jill is played by Carolyn Pickles , Liz by Deborah McAndrew , Dr Prado by Yolanda Vazquez and Dr Buxton by Mark Carey . In the second and final week of this new series , two people from different generations who work in the same or similar industries discuss changing attitudes in their fields of work . This week 's Generation Gap explores changing attitudes towards sex . The first episode of this week 's programs explores the roles of agony aunts and asks how past generations view changes in sexual attitudes over time . Irma Kurtz , the original Cosmopolitan agony aunt , talks to her younger counterpart Simone Bienne who works as a sex and relationship expert for Sky , the News Of The World , GMTV , BBC Radio 1 and the Asian press . They explore how the nature of problems has changed . The second program , Gay Protestors , asks if society has accepted homosexuality since changes in the law were introduced in the Sixties . Eighty-two-year-old Anthony Grey was one of the earliest gay rights campaigners . His youthful counterpart is Bobby , a 20-year-old volunteer who goes into schools to help combat homophobic bullying . The program examines how far gay rights have come in society , and asks if there is a new trend towards intolerance among young people . The third program , Beauty Queens , asks if beauty queens have become less sexualised since the Sixties . Lesley Langley , Miss UK and Miss World in 1965 , compares notes about her experiences with current Miss England Katrina Hodge , who is also a lance corporal in the British Army . They consider shifting attitudes to beauty , sex appeal and to women being `` judged '' on their physical appearance as opposed to their intelligence . The fourth program , featuring underwear and sex shop entrepreneurs , explores how sex lives change as people get older . Jane runs a shop in a coastal town which opened in 1922 selling thermal underwear and nighties . She is its third owner and in addition to selling ordinary underwear , now sells sex toys to people in their sixties and seventies who want to spice up their sex life . Her son , David , helps out in the shop . The final program questions whether prostitutes have noticed a change in sex lives . Maria is Russian and currently works as a prostitute to help pay her fees for medical school . Middle class Helen was a prostitute in the Seventies because she was a single mum and could earn more in one night than she could in other jobs . Presenter Alice Roberts investigates how safe it is to build new homes and schools on contaminated land , as the investigative environmental series continues . When Corby Borough Council was ruled to be negligent in its efforts to clean up the site of the town 's enormous steelworks a shiver ran through the building industry . For a decade now builders have been urged to build new homes , offices , distribution centres and hospitals on brownfield land . This meant that former industrial eyesores were cleaned up and farm and parkland was saved from the bulldozers . Last summer 's court judgement opened the way for families who believe their children were born with birth defects because of airborne contamination from the Corby development to seek compensation . As a result , groups opposing development on their local patch of contaminated land have been given powerful ammunition . Alice visits development sites across the country to ask what impact the Corby decision will have on Britain 's building industry and question whether it will be cheaper and safer for risk-averse councils and developers to turn their attention back to greenfield land . Rose Tremain 's compelling and unsettling new novel concerns sibling love , disputed territory and coming to terms with the past . Set mainly in the Cevennes in southern France with a strange murder at its heart , events begin to spin out of control after dapper but bereft Anthony turns up on his much-loved sister 's French doorstep in search of solace , a new beginning and the perfect home in which to display his beloved antiques . Meanwhile , in an isolated valley , an increasingly erratic Aramon Lunel is prepared to risk all for profit , even to make his sister homeless if that is what it takes .

She also speaks to those on the digital front line in China , where the authorities have proved extremely skilled in censoring and surveying the quarter of a billion Chinese web-users and have employed an estimated 300,000 pro-government bloggers to bolster support for their regime . The program also explores how the web has given new voice to extremist factions such as Al Qaeda and is even generating new forms of warfare . Aleks recounts how Estonia was once brought to its knees by a string of cyber attacks launched by a handful of teenage Russian hackers . Each of the four programs in the series is the result of a groundbreaking production process , in partnership with the Open University , which invited web users themselves to help shape the series at : bbc .

From his home in Perthshire , Desmond Carrington rummages through his collection of 250,000 titles , and this week celebrates band singers . A strong police presence shows during the 1984\\/85 miners ' strike In specially commissioned songs to mark the 25th anniversary of the end of miners ' strike , BBC Radio 2 explores how lives were changed by the year-long dispute -LRB- 1984-85 -RRB- . The Ballad Of The Miners ' Strike is a forthright and powerful exploration of contrasting human experiences . Songs inspired by the strike propel the ballad through issues still causing debate a quarter of a century later . Striking miners describe the physical and mental toll of the dispute and they , along with police officers , also recall the picket-line confrontations . Wives describe how the strike empowered them and The Battle of Orgreave is also remembered . The Ballad is a musical and historical tapestry which includes sequences of reflection and testimony , punctuated and driven by archive clips of news bulletins , reportage and interviews from the strike period with key figures , such as miners ' leader Arthur Scargill and Coal Board leader Ian McGregor . Musical accompaniment is provided by acclaimed folk musicians John McCusker , Andy Cutting , Bob Fox , Barry Coupe , Jez Lowe , Andy Seward , Julie Matthews and John Tams . The featured interviews were gathered across the UK by Vince Hunt , who traveled to Wales , Northumberland , Nottinghamshire , Lincolnshire , Kent and Yorkshire to talk to miners and the women who supported them , the police officers who served on the picket lines and the miners who crossed picket lines to work . These themed interviews have been used as sources to inspire the songwriters and then fed back into the songs . This is the latest in a series of award-winning Radio Ballads commissioned in recent years by BBC Radio 2 , exploring important issues of our time . In 2006 a series of six ballads explored the decline of the shipbuilding and steel industries ; 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland ; the end of hunting with hounds ; the experiences of six people affected by HIV\\/Aids ; and the lives of Britain 's fairground community . BBC Radio presenter Nikki Bedi Nikki Bedi continues to explore the history of Bollywood , in the second of this three-part series . The cheap availability of the video cassette and the cheap production values of the films being made meant that , in the UK , audiences stopped going to the cinemas of Southall , Bradford and Wolverhampton and started to stay in . In this program , Nikki looks at where the art of Hindi film strayed from its `` super hit '' formula of real-life stories and real-life heroes and took to portraying the richer lifestyles and locations of the ex-pats in the audiences . Meanwhile , the UK audience was finding new ways of expressing itself with the rise of the Asian Underground sound and Asian talent finally breaking into western TV and film . It took films like Dil Se and the emerging talents of a new breed of director and musical director to get British Asians back into the big screen of Bollywood . Guests in this series include Slumdog Millionaire composer AR Rahman ; director Shekhar Kapur ; lyricist Javed Akhtar ; actor Sir Ben Kingsley ; Playback singers Asha Bhosle and Kavita Krishnamurthy Subramanium ; superstars Amitabh Bachchan and Sharrukh Khan ; Nitin Sawhney ; and Tjinder Singh of Cornershop and Trickbaby .

The concert begins with the UK premi re of a short piece by the young Swedish composer Benjamin Staern , which takes its cue from its title , Jubilate -- a musical response to the phenomenon of spectators cheering with joy and the experience of being part of a powerful celebration . Staern 's countryman Stefan Solyom closes this magnificent program with Shostakovich 's epic 10th Symphony , the first he had composed since he was denounced by Stalin 's regime in 1948 . Completed soon after Stalin 's death in 1953 , the brutally brilliant scherzo is said to be a musical portrait of the Soviet tyrant . Booker Prize-winning novelist Hilary Mantel Rana Mitter talks to Hilary Mantel about her Booker Prize-winning novel , Wolf Hall .

Set among the new immigrant community in America in the 1840s , Scotsman Allan Pinkerton turns detective when an influx of counterfeit dollars threaten the local economy . Ronald Frame 's new play about Pinkerton is set before he becomes a detective and before he sets up his now famous detective agency . Pinkerton is running a successful barrel-making business in a small town in Illinois when he becomes a victim of a counterfeiter . Many tradesfolk in the town also find themselves in possession of useless counterfeit bills . The counterfeit-dealer 's activities are threatening the local economy .

Vivienne Parry investigates the topical subject of bullying behavior and asks when anger , teasing or persuasion become bullying . Vivienne talks to Professor Dan Olweus from University of Bergen in Norway , who carried out the first ever scientific study into the problem in the Seventies and called for legislation -- a call which fell on deaf ears . But a decade later his work kick started a growth of interest in the area . Today the wealth of anti-bullying websites , books and policies has been described by some as a `` bandwagon '' . The modern definition of bullying -- especially when applied to children -- has been stretched to include anything vaguely unpleasant . Vivienne asks whether the term is now over used to the point that it has become meaningless . In today 's sensitised culture it could be said that there is no such thing as `` normal '' behavior any longer and everyone is at risk of either being a victim or a bully , or both . 7.00-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents a Business In Sport Special , live from Manchester .

In the second of BBC Radio 3 's Lunchtime Concerts broadcast live from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama , Nicola Benedetti makes her debut appearance as a recitalist on Radio 3 with two contrasting sonatas of the early 20th century -- Prokofiev 's dark and brooding first sonata for violin and the well-loved Franck Violin Sonata .

It 's 1796 and a young antiquarian claims to have discovered a lost play by Shakespeare . He takes the play to Richard Sheridan , who agrees to produce it . By the second act , the audience are gleefully aware the play is a fake . Richard Brinsley Sheridan is the producer . Fat , 50 and forgotten -- that 's how Sheridan feels at his worse moments . His glory days as the toast of the theatrical world are over ; his self-deprecating wit is out of fashion . Perhaps this , the discovery of a lost Shakespeare play , will be an inspiration and break his writer 's block . He is so desperate he does n't want to investigate the play 's authenticity too deeply . John Philip Kemble is in the prime of life and at the height of his acting powers . He 's proud , prickly , combative and cunning . For him , this production is a win-win situation . A theatrical triumph will add to his lustre -- but , if it ends in disaster , he 's let enough people know his doubts about the play 's authenticity to be able to wash his hands of the affair . William Henry Ireland is the forger , a young man of burning financial and literary ambitions , trapped as an apprentice to a legal firm -- the perfect place to learn about old documents and how to forge them .

Fetching water , cleaning knives , shovelling out a privy , setting fires -- how did servants make sense of the tough menial duties in the 18th-century home ? During this period they made up the largest occupational group in the British state . Historian Caroline Steedman argues that servants ' resentments and personal philosophies had a huge impact on the development of the English character and the British nation state . Laurie discusses a neglected corner of social history with Caroline and Professor Amanda Vickery . Financial journalist Andreas Whittam Smith -- co-founder of The Independent newspaper , former president of the British Board of Film Classification and the Church of England 's First Church Estates Commissioner -- continues this year 's season of Lent Talks and explores the temptations of the financial world .

The switch-on of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN , the most ambitious scientific experiment ever undertaken , was watched by more than a billion people worldwide as the quest to understand some of the greatest mysteries about the universe captured the public imagination . Just a few weeks later , however , the triumph and excitement turned to disappointment as this mega machine ground to a spectacular halt . More than a year on , it seems the Large Hadron Collider is back on track and scientists claim they are just a few weeks away from creating the record-breaking particle collisions they hope will answer some of the deepest and most profound questions about the nature of the universe .

Her work is strongly informed by this experience and inspired by the colors created when matching solo instruments together in different relationships . The Scottish Ensemble , with Jonathan Morton and Clio Gould , perform string music by Tippett , Berio , Bach and Vaughan Williams . Normally an 11-piece string group , The Scottish Ensemble is enhanced for this concert in an innovative educational project with gifted young players from St Mary 's Music School in Edinburgh and students from the Royal Scottish Academy Of Music And Drama . Together , they provide an extraordinary experience for those young players working side-by-side with leading musicians in their field . Their program demonstrates the eclecticism of the ensemble 's repertoire , which ranges from contemporary through romantic repertoire to baroque and includes Tippett 's jazz-influenced Concerto for Double String Orchestra , Berio 's Corale based on the Sequenza for solo violin , Bach 's Double Violin Concerto , Vaughan Williams 's beloved Fantasia On A Theme Of Thomas Tallis and an encore of the finale of Grieg 's Holberg Suite . The Ensemble is led from the violin by Jonathan Morton . They are joined on this occasion by the group 's previous artistic director , Clio Gould , who performs the fiendish solo part in Berio 's Corale and joins Morton in the Bach Double Concerto . Mark Lawson looks at landscapes , interiors and underworlds in the fourth episode of Capturing America . In books ranging from John Updike 's The Rabbit Quartet to Marilynne Robinson 's Housekeeping , writers have captured the texture of everyday life -- work , thoughts and beliefs -- in different regions of America . Updike always remembered being inspired by the Sixties Pop Art of Andy Warhol and others -- an attempt to catch the visual reality of modern America . Updike responded by trying to achieve something similar in fiction , depicting the lives of people from places and backgrounds which had often been ignored . Richard Ford -LRB- The Sportswriter trilogy -RRB- , John Irving -LRB- The Cider House Rules -RRB- , Marilynne Robinson -LRB- Housekeeping , Gilead -RRB- and Jonathan Franzen -LRB- The Corrections -RRB- also reflect on this mission to describe the external and internal nature of life in the US in all its regional and personal variety . Oscar-winning writer Frederic Raphael 's TV drama series , The Glittering Prizes , was one of the great successes of the late Seventies . Starring Tom Conti and set in the early Fifties , it followed the fortunes of a group of undergraduates , watching how their hopes and ambitions were fulfilled , or not , in the next 25 years . After the success of the BBC Radio 4 adaptation and its sequel , Fame And Fortune , Final Demands continues the story , chronicling English social life and public and private values in the last decade of the brutal 20th century . Final Demands once again reunites many of the original cast , including Tom Conti , Barbara Kellermann , Nigel Havers , Mark Wing Davey , Angela Down , Malcolm Stoddard and Emily Richard . It also introduces Julian Rhind Tutt , Colin McFarlane , Julian Glover and Alistair McGowan to this stellar cast . It is now the Nineties and , for all of those friends from the Fifties , life has moved on . Once again , Raphael brings all his wit , invention and insight to his diverse , vivid and utterly convincing group of characters . Tom Conti stars as Adam Morris ; Barbara Kellermann as Barbara Morris ; Mark Wing-Davey as Mike Clode ; Alistair McGowan as Alan Parks ; Malcolm Sinclair as Gavin Pope ; Nigel Havers as Denis Porson ; Rupert Degas as Tom Morris ; Flora Montgomery as Rachel Morris ; Angela Down as Joyce Hadleigh ; Adrian Lukis as Derek Morris ; and Julian Rhind-Tutt as Jonty . Adam Rutherford investigates the new science of morality and talks to the researchers who are tackling an age-old problem with some cutting-edge techniques . Using the latest brain-scanning technology with some well-known moral dilemmas , scientists at Harvard have been tackling a subject that strikes at the core of what it means to be human -- with some surprising and controversial results . What they are discovering suggests that morality could be hardwired in the brain -- a universal human trait honed by millions of years of evolution , rather than a process purely learned in childhood . However , where do such findings leave philosophy and religion ? Adam tracks down philosopher AC Grayling and the Dean of Guildford , Victor Stock , to ask whether they feel science can really tackle a subject as abstract and complex as morality . He finds out how these radical new findings might impact hundreds of years of philosophical and sociological musings about where and why humans have a moral code . 7.00-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Eleanor Oldroyd is joined by some top sports correspondents for The Headline Hour , discussing the week 's top sporting stories .

Rome 's Ponte Milvio is the focus of the final program in the short series examining iconic bridges from around the world , through the experiences and thoughts of people linked to these structures . The long-since-destroyed original Ponte Milvio served as the focal point for one of the most important battles in the history of Christianity -- the Battle of Milvian Bridge . Today , the bridge has become a site of romantic pilgrimage for young Italian lovers . The couples clip a golden padlock onto one of the bridge 's ornate lampposts , stand with their backs to the Tiber and toss the key into the river as a sign of their eternal devotion . However , after three separate lampposts buckled under the weight of hundreds of padlocks , the democratic mayor began to penalize the teenagers , amid fears for the safety of the ancient bridge . The move left him accused of being `` anti love '' . This program examines the bridge as a site of both romantic and religious pilgrimage , exploring the art and architecture it has inspired and the imaginative space it occupies in the minds of generations of Romans .

The deal reportedly involves 10 album projects over seven years - including one of previously unreleased material . The singer died at his Los Angeles home in June , aged 50 . He was due to stage a series of comeback concerts in Britain . Michael Jackson 's death was ruled as homicide , mainly caused by the use of the anesthetic Propofol . The contract with Sony could be worth up to $ 250m if certain conditions are met , the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday , citing sources close to the deal . It reflects sales of Jackson 's music and memorabilia - which have sky-rocketed in the months since his death , making the late star one of the biggest-earning acts of last year , says the BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani in Los Angeles . Sony has sold about 31 million copies of Jackson 's albums worldwide since his death on 25 June , the report said . His estate may soon be able to pay off some of the huge debts he left behind , our correspondent adds . According to US media , Jackson also left behind dozens of new songs , which may be released , along with revamped packages of old hits . More details are expected in an official announcement later on Tuesday , but the contract is reported to include the soundtrack to the recent film , This Is It . The footage showed Jackson rehearsing for his comeback tour just days before his death from an overdose of an anesthetic . His doctor , Conrad Murray , who told police he had prescribed Propofol for insomnia , has pleaded not guilty to a charge of manslaughter . He has always maintained that he neither prescribed nor administered anything that should have killed the singer .

Man who drinks daughter 's breast milk to combat cancer Cancer sufferer Tim Browne pours a rather bizarre ingredient over his breakfast cornflakes his daughter s breast milk . Mum-of-one Georgia , 27 , expresses her milk after feeding baby son Monty , then delivers it to her ailing dad in the hope that it will boost his immune system as he battles colon and liver cancer . And one month after drinking her milk mixed with his daily pinta , scans showed that 67-year-old Tim s cancer had reduced . Tim , a retired teacher , of Calne , Wilts , said : It s not unpleasant just slightly pungent and oily . But once it is mixed with cow s milk , I can t taste it . I do feel like I have a special bond with Georgia and Monty . Daughter Georgia , of Bristol , said : I don t find it strange at all . I m just glad to help . My mum Carole and my siblings are right behind it . In fact , they all think it s quite funny and Dad s told his friends . Tim was diagnosed with cancer in July 2007 , a week before Georgia s wedding . He had an operation to remove a tumor and a year of chemotherapy put the disease in remission . But it returned when Georgia was pregnant . Baby Monty was just a month old when she saw a TV documentary on the benefits of breast milk . She said : This man with prostate cancer swore that drinking breast milk every day had reduced his tumors . Dad agreed it was a worth a go . Tim s doctors support the odd concoction . But although scans show that his condition has improved , it can not be proved if it is down to the milk or chemotherapy . World Cancer Research Fund UK said : We are not aware of any evidence that breast milk brings any benefits to cancer patients . Georgia said : I d do anything to give my dad more time . Prince Philip in strip club gaffe Prince Philip put his foot in it during a visit to a barracks when he asked a young Navy sea cadet instructor if she worked in a strip club . The Duke of Edinburgh 's question provoked howls of laughter from Elizabeth Rendle , 24 , and her friends , reports the Daily Mail . Miss Rendle , a barmaid , said Philip had asked her what she did for a living : `` I told him I worked in a club . He then asked if it was a strip club , '' she said . The 88-year-old royal then appeared to think better of the suggestion in the current weather and joked that such an occupation would be `` too cold '' . The Duke was with the Queen at Wyvern Barracks in Exeter during a tour of Devon . Miss Rendle later said that , far from being offended by the question , she felt Prince Philip had been `` putting people at their ease '' . She said : `` He was just going round chatting with people , asking them what they did for a living . `` It was a joke and we were all laughing which drew everyone else 's attention . I do n't think he put his foot in it . It was a joke and I did n't take any offence . '' Row over Tiger Woods blow-up doll Lawyers for Tiger Woods are reportedly trying to halt the sale of a series of sex toys which exploit the golfer 's personal problems . -LRB- Unsuitable\\/Broken URL removed by Moderator -RRB- The toys include a ` Take Home , Blow-up Tiger Love Doll ' and are for sale on the website of Pipedream Products . Pipedream is advertising its Tiger products as being `` available for a very limited time only '' . The US gossip website TMZ.com has managed to obtain a copy of a lawyer 's letter to Pipedream . It is demanding that the company stops selling the products , recalls all items that have already been distributed and destroys all stock . This is n't the first time lawyers have been called to deal with offensive products in the wake of the Tiger Woods scandal . In February , Joslyn James , one of his extramarital girlfriends , called on her lawyers to stop the sale of sets of `` mistress '' golf balls in which each ball featured the face of one of his alleged lovers . Michael Jackson 's syringe ` up for sale ' The syringe that allegedly administered Michael Jackson 's fatal dose of drugs is reportedly set to go on sale for # 3.3 million . The needle is believed to have been obtained secretly and is apparently being offered around Las Vegas auction houses , reports the Daily Mirror . Michael Jackson 's family are said to have been informed by lawyers representing the unnamed seller and are said to be desperate to stop the sale . The artefact could go under the hammer on June 25 - the first anniversary of the singer 's death in Los Angeles . His personal doctor , Conrad Murray , 57 , has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after allegedly administering drugs such as Valium , lorazepam and propofol to the troubled star . An autopsy found that Jackson died from `` lethal levels '' of propofol , a powerful anesthetic . The syringe set to go on sale is said to be the one used to administer the fatal dose . The Mirror quoted a source as saying : `` This is one of the sickest lots ever put up . The syringe is no longer needed in the inquest or in Murray 's forthcoming trial but the moral implications do n't bear thinking about . `` The guy who has possession of the needle has been in meetings with his legal team , making sure it is legitimate and his to sell . `` The plan is to flog it for up to $ 5m in a big Vegas casino but he 's been told he may have to sell it somewhere that does n't have ` reciprocal legal agreements with the United States ' , such as Brazil or even Libya . `` Rumours are leaking thick and fast and the Jackson family are aware of the auction plan . They are furious and incensed that someone is yet again trying to profit from him . It 's an incredibly distressing time for them . '' Theme park takes the p \\*\\*\\* A Surrey theme park is calling on members of the public to submit their urine samples in a bid to find the country 's most pungent smelling wee . Thorpe Park , near Chertsey , wants it to become the signature stench of its brand new attraction , SAW Alive - billed as the world 's most extreme live action horror maze . Bosses are offering a # 500 cash prize to the person who submits the winning sample and is asking entrants to attend the park on Friday , 26 , February between 11am and 2pm . The distinctive smell of the winning entry will be recreated and feature in the new attraction , which features six traps depicting the most grisly and iconic scenes from the six SAW films . It will be pumped into the iconic washroom scene , recreating a `` realistic and truly gut wrenching sensory experience '' designed to test the nerve of all who enter . Laura Sinclair , Thorpe Park 's entertainments manager , will be responsible for selecting the most stomach turning urine sample . She said : `` We want SAW Alive to be as authentic and terrifying as possible to make visitors feel as if they are living in a real life horror film . `` To do this we need to really push the boundaries of what our guests experience from a sensory point of view with the use of smells , special lighting and effects such as electrocution and vibrating floors that will create a full on attack of the senses . `` We 've begun creating some of the stenches of SAW Alive but need the help of the public to create the most realistic and unsavoury urine odour . We are looking for a sample that will really get the public gagging .

Lucy Duran introduces iconic Brazilian singer Carlinhos Brown , recorded live in concert for World Routes in the Moroccan city of Agadir , and also features a set from veteran Jamaican reggae singer Max Romeo -- both artists making their debut appearance in Africa . The Timitar Festival in Agadir gives both of these artists a chance to fulfil a dream -- to perform on the continent that both consider their spiritual home . When Max Romeo released his song Wet Dream in 1969 , the BBC never quite believed his claim that it was about a leaky roof , and the record was famously banned . In the Seventies he moved away from what he called his `` saucy '' songs and became a Rastafarian , writing songs such as War In-a Babylon . Carlinhos Brown 's music has its roots in religious music of the African Yoruba deities , but his style ranges far and wide . He is seen as hugely influential in Brazil , not only because of his music , but also because of his work in the favelas of northern Brazil , where he runs a music school . Live from the Metropolitan Opera in New York , Adam Fischer conducts Mozart 's Die zauberflte -LRB- The Magic Flute -RRB- , with Nathan Gunn as Papageno , Matthew Polenzani as Tamino and Julia Kleiter as Pamina . Tamino , trying to escape from a huge snake , trips and falls unconscious . Three ladies appear and kill the snake with their spears . When he recovers , Tamino sees an odd-looking man entirely covered with feathers dancing towards him . It is Papageno , a bird-catcher . He tells the astonished Tamino that this is the realm of the Queen of the Night . The gods have plans for Tamino , but first he must prove that he is worthy of admission to the Temple of Light . Luckily Tamino has the assistance of his magic flute and eventually overcomes the ordeals that are put in his way . Presented by Margaret Juntwait with guest commentator Ira Siff , there are live backstage interviews with members of the cast during the interval . Writer Tahir Shah , who has made Morocco his home for the past six years , journeys deep into the heart of Morocco -- the square Jma el Fna in Marrakech -- in search of its centuries-old primal energy . Jma el Fna may be a common tourist destination for the international hoards that descend on Marrakech , but it remains a very sacred and special place for Moroccans . In a meditation drawing together the storytellers , transvestite players , boxers , master musicians , cigarette sellers , snake charmers , medicine men and many more , Tahir explores the halkas , or circles , where they gather their crowds to enchant and engage . The sounds of Jma el Fna tell their own story and as Tahir moves between night and day and from circle to circle , he looks for order beneath the apparent chaos ; within it he finds an oral tradition and an ancient life-force defying the onslaught of mass tourism and globalisation . Harold Pinter , who went to Turkey with fellow playwright Arthur Miller to protest about the imprisonment and torture of intellectuals In The Ambassador 's Reception presenter Maureen Freely explores a journey to Turkey made by Arthur Miller and Harold Pinter . Miller and Pinter went to Turkey in 1985 to protest about the imprisonment and torture of intellectuals . The trip culminated in the pair being thrown out of the American Ambassador 's dinner party held in Arthur Miller 's honor . They were visiting Turkey to draw attention to the limits being set on freedom of expression at that time , and the many writers languishing in prison . Writer and journalist Maureen Freely retraces their footsteps across Istanbul into the homes and meeting places of the Turkish literati who , in the Eighties , were oppressed , imprisoned and tortured for their opinions . Until then the world had turned a blind eye to their plight . Freely asks if Pinter and Miller 's trip successfully drew attention to a regime that was persecuting its people or if hopes were raised only to be quashed again . Maureen hears from painters , writers , and publishers -- those who remember the trip vividly , those who were locked up for speaking their mind and the new generation of authors . She finds out whether Turkey is a better , safer and freer place to be a writer today than it was in the spring of 1985 , or whether having an opinion that deviates from the official line remains a dangerous path to tread . Ray Quinn stars as James in The Believers by Frank Cottrell Boyce , a comedy drama that follows a Merseybeat Christian pop band . Set in the early Sixties , the band , The Believers , grapple with life and love as they seek to spread `` The Word '' . But it would help if they were all singing from the same hymn sheet . James and Billy are nice lads but they do n't really get things together until they meet Debbie in a club . She might not be a `` believer '' but she 's in love with music and has enough drive and ambition for all three of them . Managed by the pastor at their local mission hall , The Believers start to make an impression , not least because they have a female drummer . Then The Beatles have their first hit and the world goes crazy for the Merseybeat sound . The Believers find themselves as the house band in a gambling dive in Leeds ; a gambling dive that employs attractive young women dressed as rabbits to distract the punters from their inevitable losses . Can the band survive this eye-opening plunge into the seamy side of life at a time when the two boys discover a new passion beyond their faith in God ? For James and Billy are both falling in love with Debbie .

Musician and broadcaster Rainer Hersch investigates the puzzle of The Armed Man -LRB- L'homme arm -RRB- and unpicks the known facts about the tune and its words . The musical powerhouse of Europe in the 15th century was based in Burgundy . The Ducal court outdid everyone else in splendor and power , and one tune caught the imagination of the court composers . Early music specialists Catherine Bott and Andrew Kirkman think the original song may have been a warning against the threat of the warring Turks , following the fall of Constantinople in 1453 . But it could equally have been a popular children 's song or even the name of a pub frequented by some of those composers . Whatever its origin , it became the big hit of that time , but then , like much of pop music , it just went out of fashion and disappeared . Rainer tries to unravel the medieval puzzle , and then find out why the song suddenly burst back into life in the 20th century . Christopher Marshall heard it in his New Zealand secondary school and some years later used it as the inspiration for a lively piece for wind band . Karl Jenkins was introduced to it during the Kosovo crisis 10 years ago , and composed his popular Mass For Peace . Rainer traces the journey of the tune and the words -- never far from the constant threat of war , while appearing in completely different musical clothes . Presenter\\/Rainer Hersch , Producers\\/Merilyn Harris and Richard Bannerman In this week 's Archive On Four , historian Alan Dein celebrates the centenary of his mentor George Ewart Evans , collector of Suffolk farming tales . George Ewart Evans put the village of Blaxhall on the map and created a tradition of oral history in the UK , recording fireside chats . He began by chatting to his neighbors over the fireside in the Fifties and transcribing stories about poaching , shepherding , smuggling and ditching . The talk was of a hardscrabble life , of leaky roofs and meals of pea soup and pollard dumplings and beef only at Christmas , with occasional festivities like the Whitsun fair . Evans came from a Welsh mining village and he sympathised with the labourers ' stories about the tyranny of the trinity of parson , squire and farmer . He was a sympathetic listener who allowed his community to speak for itself and he captured the stories of people whose traditions had been unbroken for generations ; who worked on the land before mechanisation ; who believed in magic and folk wisdom ; and who had intuitive understanding of working with animals . Evans 's 11 books about the working lives and folk stories of Blaxhall are a portrait of every facet of his village and paved the way for books and programs , both fiction and not fiction , about British agricultural life . Alan Dein talks to people who remember Evans in the village of Blaxhall and to his son Lord Evans and youngest daughter Susan , as well as historian Owen Collins . 12.00noon-7 .00 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents 5 Live Sport live from Aintree ahead of the 2010 Grand National .

It made household names of its stars Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews and starred two of the greatest actors of the 20th century , Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud . Based on the best-selling novel by Evelyn Waugh , and adapted initially by John Mortimer and then also Derek Granger , it told a poignant story of forbidden love and religious faith set prior to the Second World War . The size and scale of the series was unprecedented . To make 11 50-minute episodes , shot entirely on film and all on location was a huge undertaking . And no expense was spared with glamorous costumes , vintage cars and exotic locations including Venice , Malta and the QE2 . It was one of the most expensive ITV serials ever made and set the benchmark for others to follow , notably Jewel In The Crown in 1985 . Sue is joined around the table by : Jeremy Irons , who played the narrator of the story , Charles Ryder ; Anthony Andrews , who was Sebastian Flyte ; Claire Bloom , who played Sebastian 's mother , Lady Marchmain ; the series ' director Charles Sturridge ; Derek Granger , the producer ; and Diana Quick , who was Lady Julia Flyte , Sebastian 's sister .

His poetry lives on , however , largely in anthologies or as requests on Poetry Please , and Brian Patten is determined to find out as much as he can about the man who wrote some beautiful poetry about love , cats and , more unusually , Luton . For a man who never found the love of which he dreamed , he was conspicuously tenacious in looking for it , but , as a Tessimond researcher explains in Lost Voices this afternoon , he had a fatal tendency to seek love from unsuitable women -- chorus girls and nightclub hostesses . Nevertheless , Tessimond is clearly a man who inspired affection and , in the course of the program , Brian himself develops a soft spot for `` Tessy '' . 12.00noon-6 .00 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Colin Murray presents the latest sports news and an afternoon of live sport .

Starting with a funeral march and exploring the idea of life after death , Symphony No. 2 sweeps through the gamut of emotions to a visionary choral finale in which the heavens seem to open .

Unsettling things begin to happen around the farm -- graffiti appears on the walls in the dead of night ; supplies are stolen ; and a dead fox is left on the porch .

On the face of it they could n't be more different but , as Natalie discovers , the two forms have rather more in common than stereotype might have people believe . Soap and Greek tragedy alike focus relentlessly on families under pressure ; both see it as their job to confront their fellow citizens with social taboos ; and both compete keenly to win the praise of mass audiences .

Clive is a lawyer working for human rights both in Britain and abroad . He campaigns for the rights of prisoners on death row in the US and in Guantanamo Bay . His nomination for a life worth celebrating is at first surprising since it is the entirely fictitious Robin Hood . But , he argues in conversation with medievalist professor Stephen Knight and presenter Matthew Paris , the myth has a lot to teach about the way people treat each other . Dr Mark Porter looks at the treatment of serious complications in the feet and eyes arising from diabetes , in this week 's dose of the medical series . Every week in the UK , diabetes is the cause of around 100 foot amputations . One of the commonest consequences of diabetes is restriction of blood flow to different organs and parts of the body . With reduced blood flow in the feet , sufferers are at considerable risk of developing dangerously infected ulcers . If the ulcers are not caught in time , many patients have to lose their feet in order to save their lives . Dr Mark Porter visits the specialist diabetic foot clinic at King 's College Hospital in London . There he talks to doctors , surgeons and foot specialists about the risks of life-threatening complications of diabetes in the feet , and hears about the various treatments and surgical operations which are helping to reduce the number of amputations for their patients . Mark also talks to patients about their experiences of the insidious threat from foot ulcers and how they 've been treated . The disease process which leads to ulcers developing in the feet also takes place in the eyes of some diabetic patients . Diabetic retinopathy presents a real risk of blindness if it 's not detected and treated . Mark also visits the eye clinic at King 's College Hospital to see laser treatment in action .

Clive Anderson looks at groups of people who can claim immunity from the law as the series in which some of the country 's top judges and lawyers discuss legal issues of the day continues . The program explores why certain groups of people , in certain situations , appear to be `` above the law '' : granted immunity from prosecution or civil action . MPs facing criminal charges over their expenses , under a legal convention dating back to the 17th century , may be able to argue that their behavior is covered by parliamentary privilege . This is the privilege which allows MPs and peers to make slanderous remarks within the Houses of Parliament without fear of being sued in the civil courts . The panel examines why it is being argued that this might provide a defense from prosecution for criminal offences . Diplomatic immunity protects embassy staff from prosecution for any offence , from non-payment of parking fines to murder . Crown or state immunity establishes that the sovereign or state can not commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution . But can this immunity be extended to cover national security agents accused of torture on the grounds that they are `` agents of the state '' or to protect heads of state accused of war crimes or corruption ? This program also discusses immunity from prosecution granted to super-grasses and other defendants who provide evidence to the prosecution .

This week 's show features music by Johnnie Ray , Tex Ritter , The Simpsons and Tim Hardin . Tim has long been fascinated by the history and geography of America : `` The sheer romanticism of the names of the 50 States is poetry to my ears and the opportunity to explore every State of the union through its music , musicians , composers , lyricists and performers is irresistible for me . `` I hope each broadcast , through music old and new , familiar and unexpected , proves an enjoyable slice of American Pie , none quite like the 49 others . '' Presenter\\/Sir Tim Rice , Producer\\/Anthony Cherry Violist Lawrence Power joins the BBC Scottish SO to perform Mikls Rzsa 's viola concerto In this live concert from City Halls , Glasgow , Alexander Titov conducts the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in works from Russia and America , beginning with an introduction and interlude from Rimsky-Korsakov 's opera , The Legend Of The Invisible City Of Kitezh , which combines the real and the supernatural , history and myth . Violist Lawrence Power joins the orchestra to perform Mikls Rzsa 's Viola Concerto . Born in Hungary , Mikls Rzsa wrote many classical works but went to Hollywood in 1939 to work on film scores and is probably best known for his blockbusters including Ben-Hur and El Cid . His Viola Concerto is one of his final works , written in 1979 for the young Pinchas Zukerman . The least well known of Rachmaninov 's symphonies , the First -- an incredibly powerful work , bursting with youthful energy -- ends this evening 's concert . Its premire , when Rachmaninov was only 24 , was famously a disaster and it was never again performed in his lifetime . Journalist John Harris investigates the influence of the suburbs and provincial towns on British rock music , from Colchester to Swindon . Harris argues that much of the best British music has been rooted in the rather staid environs of the UK 's suburbs and provincial towns , soundtracking a world of privet hedges , caravans parked on driveways and curtain-twitching intrigue . In this feature , he travels to the places where the music was born , talks to the people who created it and places them in a tradition that is too-often ignored . In Swindon , he meets Andy Partridge of the seminal band XTC , who has always insisted on living in a place he knows drives him mad so his creative fires do n't go out . In Colchester , he delves into the experiences essayed by Britpop pioneers Blur and hears from Damon Albarn . In Gants Hill in Essex he meets Louise Wener , former lead singer of Britpop band Sleeper ; in Coventry , he considers the music of The Specials ; in Woking he considers renowned suburban poet Paul Weller ; and , in the unexpected rock hotbed of Bromley , he tells the stories of a handful of local suburban `` refuseniks '' , including David Bowie and Siouxsie Sioux . To show that the tradition is still continuing , he speaks to the band Good Shoes and considers their track about living in Morden . Along the way , there are flashbacks to non-musical stuff on which some of these songwriters have drawn : John Betjeman 's TV documentary Metro-Land , and such poems as Slough and Middlesex ; Philip Larkin 's I Remember , I Remember , which is set in Coventry ; and George Orwell 's classic suburban novel Coming Up For Air . The Disappearance , by Peter Whalley , is a psychological thriller with fraudulent identity at its heart . Alice moves into a converted Victorian house and rents the top floor . The landlord lives below . Both tenant and landlord are not who they say they are , and as each discovers the truth , it is clear one of them is going to die . When Alice moves into the property it 's fairly obvious that the young landlord fancies her . She quickly befriends him . But her actions seem to over-step the boundary of safe behavior and , when she tells the landlord that she knows he 's not the real owner , he confesses to the secret fraud . Then a letter of inheritance arrives for the real owner and the tenant and the landlord undertake a heist . But Alice is hiding a bigger secret . She 's on a quest for revenge ... The Disappearance features Lee Ingleby as Martin , Joanne Froggatt as Alice and Becky Hindley as Denise . Arthur Smith presents comedy , music and entertainment from his Balham flat .

RAF Holbeach is a bombing range on the Lincolnshire Wash that is used by British , American and European squadrons for training purposes . Protected in part by the military presence , the range has a curious atmosphere . With the targets at RAF Holbeach being used by trainee pilots and nesting birds , this program reveals how a bombing range can be home to both wildlife and warfare . A team of civilian employees man the targets and look after the natural landscape . The targets themselves are a collection of old ships , armored personnel carriers and ad hoc structures made from scrap material . In the eyes of one local artist , Michael Sanders , they look like `` accidental sculptures '' , punching out from the stark landscape of the Wash. . Local contractor Norman Parnell takes great pride in building and maintaining these structures , despite the fact that they are constantly damaged by artillery fire and the tide . And Holbeach employee Geoff Smith is as careful to check for damage to the electronic scoring system as he is in spotting oyster-catcher eggs at the targets . Those who work at RAF Holbeach maintain a delicate balance between protecting the environment and serving the needs of the pilots that use the range ahead of deployment .

Jackson died of a cardiac arrest at his home on 25 June last year . His death was ruled as homicide , largely as a result of the powerful anesthetic drug Propofol . Jackson 's doctor , Conrad Murray has denied a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the singer 's death . Sgt Lorenz said : `` We understand that Forest Lawn is working with the Jackson family for some kind of commemoration . `` We will be working closely with Forest Lawn to ensure the safety of those who want to pay their respects to Michael Jackson while ensuring the safety of others who are coming to the cemetery to pay respects to their loved ones , '' he added . Plans are expected to be finalized by the end of this week . The city of Los Angeles has no plans to issue special permits for access to the cemetery which would allow streets to be closed off and the sale of memorabilia . The singer was buried at a ceremony in September which was seen on television , while fans were largely kept away from the cemetery grounds . Jackson is due to be posthumously inducted into the Apollo Legends Hall of Fame at a ceremony in New York on 14 June . The singer , along with his brothers , won a talent show at the New York theater in 1967 , which led to the Jackson Five being signed to Motown Records .

The death of the music superstar prompted an outpouring of grief from fans around the world and resulted in the singer 's doctor , Conrad Murray , being charged with involuntary manslaughter . We take a look at some of the unresolved issues surrounding the late King of Pop . In the months before his death , Michael Jackson employed Dr Conrad Murray , a cardiologist with practices in Las Vegas and Houston , as his personal physician . He was with the singer on the day he died but the doctor has always maintained that nothing he did should have killed Jackson . Dr Murray denies any wrongdoing On 8 February , 2010 , Dr Murray appeared in court in Los Angeles and pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter . He has since made two further court appearances in the case and remains on $ 75,000 -LRB- # 50,000 -RRB- bail . He is free to practice medicine , providing he does not administer powerful sedatives , such as Propofol . Dr Murray is due to appear in court again on 23 August , when Judge Michael Pastor is expected to set a date for a preliminary hearing , which should start within 60 days of that date . A trial date can not be set until the process is completed and Judge Pastor has had an opportunity to consider the evidence . Dr Murray could be sent to jail for up to four years if found guilty . Like Elvis Presley , Michael Jackson remains a hugely powerful commodity from beyond the grave . Jackson is estimated to have made more than $ 1bn since his death According to estimates by music newspaper Billboard , the singer 's estate made more than $ 1bn -LRB- # 668m -RRB- since his death . The publication says album sales have generated about $ 383m -LRB- # 259m -RRB- and revenue from the film , This Is It , amounted to nearly $ 400m -LRB- # 267m -RRB- . Jackson 's This is It concerts , despite never taking place , also proved to be hugely profitable . Many fans held on to their tickets as souvenirs , instead of refunding them , which brought in about $ 6.5 m -LRB- # 4.3 m -RRB- , to be shared with the promoter AEG . The estate also made money from DVD sales , downloads , royalties and ringtones . It was revealed last week that the estate has agreed to foot the bill for Jackson 's memorial service in Los Angeles , with $ 1.3 m -LRB- # 868,169 -RRB- to be paid to the City of Los Angeles and the LA Police Foundation . In death , Jackson achieved the musical comeback that he had yearned for in the latter years of his life . He was the biggest selling album artist of 2009 , with 8.3 million sales , the vast majority of which were posthumous . In the past year , nearly 9 million of his albums have sold in the US alone , according to chart analyists Nielsen SoundScan . This is It , the film that documented the singer 's rehearsals for his London concerts , is the highest-grossing concert film and documentary in cinematic history . Sony Music Entertainment will release 10 albums of Jackson 's music over the next seven years , including one of previously unreleased material . Jackson 's children spoke at a Grammy awards tribute to the late singer Jackson 's children , Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. -LRB- 13 -RRB- , Paris Katherine Jackson -LRB- 12 -RRB- and Prince Michael Jackson II -LRB- 8 -RRB- , commonly known as Blanket , are being cared for by their grandmother , Katherine , who was awarded guardianship in accordance with Jackson 's wishes . The children have largely stayed out of the public eye , with the exception of Jackson 's memorial service and the Grammy Awards ceremony . The children have been schooled at home although it has been reported that Michael Joseph -LRB- Prince -RRB- will attend a private school from September . Jackson 's fans are an ever-present force at court hearings for Dr Conrad Murray . They claim the charge of involuntary manslaughter is too lenient and have criticised prosecutors on the case . Fans reflect on the Jackson annniversary Many fans have vowed to continue fighting for `` justice '' for their idol . `` I love him even more than I did already , '' said Natalia Franco , at a recent hearing . `` It 's just now that we 're really grasping his message of love and humanitarianism , '' added Amy Kimes . `` On the one-year anniversary I 'm very anxious ... I 'm asking lots of questions of why . '' The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

The civil suit from Joe Jackson accuses Dr Conrad Murray of professional negligence in administering a fatal mix of sedatives to the singer . The suit was filed as fans around the world marked the first anniversary of Jackson 's death at the age of 50 . Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in his death . Mr Jackson 's complaint seeks damages of more than $ 75,000 -LRB- # 50,000 -RRB- and alleges that Dr Murray was negligent in administering his son with the anesthetic propofol and other drugs . It also accuses him of secrecy and poor training and claims that Dr Murray 's clinics in Las Vegas , Nevada , and Houston , Texas , did not adequately supervise him . Fans sing outside the Jackson family home A spokeswoman for the doctor said she would not comment until his lawyers had reviewed the lawsuit . The case will run parallel with the criminal trial against Dr Murray , which is expected to begin next year . Dr Murray was treating Jackson as he prepared for a series of concerts in London . As the suit was filed in a federal court in Los Angeles , fans of the singer around the world paid him tribute . In New York , the Apollo Theatre - where Jackson and his brothers won a talent contest and were subsequently signed to Motown Records - fans recreated his famous dance moves and a letter from his mother Katherine was read out . In Los Angeles , celebrities including Mickey Rooney and Corey Feldman attended a tribute to the singer , Forever Michael , at the Beverly Hills Hilton hotel . The show included a performance by Michael 's brother , Tito . Proceeds from the event went to the Jackson Family Foundation . In his hometown of Gary , Indiana , Jackson 's mother attended a memorial service outside the performer 's childhood home and unveiled a monument to him . Other family members visited the Los Angeles cemetery where the musician is at rest and greeted some of the fans who had gathered outside . Flowers were also left in tribute to the late star in Tokyo , where 50 fans spent the night in an exhibition of his possessions . Meanwhile , prisoners in the Philippines were to mark the anniversary by staging a version of Thriller for invited members of the public on Saturday . The inmates of Cebu jail became an internet phenomenon when they were filmed performing the dance in 2007 . Jackson has been named as the biggest selling artist in the UK since his death last year , with 4.3 million sales . That exceeds his chart performance during his 1980s heyday , the Official Chart Company has said . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

A year on from his sudden death , tributes were paid to the pop star outside the family home , the cemetery where he was laid to rest and at his star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame . The fans brought flowers , held candlelight vigils and left handwritten notes paying homage to the musician . `` I 'm sad and I miss him but it does n't feel like a year since he 's been gone , '' said Vanessa Montez , who visited the Jackson family home in Encino , California . `` He 's very much still alive through his music and in my heart . '' Kellie Sargent said : `` He was the best entertainer there ever was on the planet so that 's why we 're here all the way from Atlanta , Georgia . `` It 's sad in a way but it 's a celebration of his life and entertainment . '' Fans traveled to Los Angeles from around the world . `` I 'm here for Michael Jackson because I love him , '' said Valerie Giordani from the south of France . `` It cost me a lot of money , a lot of time , but I do n't mind because my husband and I really love him . '' The main focus of the Los Angeles tributes was at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park , where the singer 's golden casket was entombed last September in a neo-classical mausoleum . `` I always wanted a chance to show him my gratitude but now I know I never will because he 's not with us anymore , '' said Sekou Barrow , another fan . `` He has n't been with us for the last year , and today we 're here at the memorial park to celebrate his life . '' `` It 's refreshing to see that everyone is celebrating the life of Michael Jackson , not mourning the death , '' added Carlo Riley . `` We had him for 50 years , more than we could ever ask for . He produced a large amount of material for generations to enjoy so I 'm very pleased to have been alive during his lifetime . '' Outside Jackson 's rented home in Beverly Hills , sightseeing buses crawled along the street , at the precise minute , 12-months on , that the singer was rushed to hospital . A wax model of Jackson was put on display in front of Madame Tussauds on Hollywood Boulevard , close to the singer 's star on the Walk of Fame . The star itself was covered in floral tributes and surrounded by candles . Some fans left notes for Jackson . Tour buses drove past the house where Michael Jackson died `` We miss you Michael , '' read one . `` You were our angel on earth , now you an angel in Heaven , '' said another . Dennis Ezequeiel , dressed as Jackson , visited the star with his mother . `` He 's the best because he helped the people so much and that 's why I like to dress like him , '' said the 10-year old . `` I like the dances he did and the songs like Man in the Mirror . '' Some of the fans reflected on the slow pace of the legal proceeding surrounding Dr Conrad Murray , Jackson 's physician , who has pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter . If the case goes to trial , it is likely to be well into next year before a jury hears the evidence . `` I wish there were closure , '' said Kimberly Solano from Washington , New Jersey . `` But I understand that things take time and I just pray that the family finds peace . '' The tributes will continue throughout the weekend . Jackson family members are expected to attend a gala event , `` Forever Michael , '' at a Beverly Hills hotel on Saturday .

Fairs ' \\* Annals of a Parish : A Short History of Hay-on-Wye \\* -LRB- Thornton Books , 1994 -RRB- . Chapter 10 deals with `` Transport by Road , Rail & Water '' and refers to the establishing of Turnpike Trusts and the opening of the Hereford to Brecon turnpike via Hay in 1757 . Fairs mentions a couple of dwellings related to the turnpike which may possibly be candidates for the house Neil refers to as being mentioned in the 1881 Census . In Hay `` the toll house was at Dishpool Lane -LRB- now Forest Road -RRB- on the junction of that and the Brecon Road , close to the Manor Pound -LRB- formerly on the SE of the corner , but this stone-walled enclosure has disappeared with the construction of houses on the adjacent fields -RRB- . Fairs goes on to remark that this toll house was eventually bought by the Council in 1895 and demolished . Fairs mentions two other possibilities : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Black Lion Toll House which `` still exists just beyond the bridge over the Dulas brook and was locally known as the Nantyglasdwr -LRB- anglice Nantyglaster -RRB- gate '' ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the Cooper 's Hall gate -LRB- on the Whitney road -RRB- that `` was moved about a mile westward -LRB- Fairs must surely mean `` north-eastward '' -RRB- to Pontvaen in 1867 . Both toll houses are now dwelling houses '' -LRB- pp.79-80 -RRB- . Notice , of course , that the words `` Turnpike House '' are not used by Fairs , but it is just possible that the 1881 Census did refer to one of these toll-houses in that fashion .

David : `` In doing my genealogical research of two towns in Southwestern Wisconsin settled by Welsh emigrants in the 1840-1850 period , I have discovered that many of them originated from an area around the Cors Caron bog . The movement from Wales , GB to Wales , WI and Genesee , WI was started by one person , Richard `` King '' Jones , who bought some 5000 acres at $ 1.25 per acre , and arranged for several hundred families to come to Wisconsin , where they purchased plots of land from him , ranging from 40 to 200 acres . My own ancestor , John M Jones , lived on a small plot on a hill overlooking the Southeast part of the bog . It is a mile or so from Tregaron . There is a raised ring there where an early structure once stood . The farm is now called Lwyn-Gwinau , and the Victorian Ordnance Map shows the former earthen structure listed as Castel Lwyn-Gwinau . John M Jones left the Tregaron area in 1847 with his family and moved to Southeastern Wisconsin , where the native Indians numbered 100 for every white man , according to his grandson , my grandfather . Welsh was spoken in these Wisconsin towns well into the 1930 's . The towns are about 20 miles west of Milwaukee . One can find more on the individual Welsh emigrants to this area in Wisconsin by searching Google for my treatise , `` The Welsh Pioneers of Waukesha County , Wisconsin '' .

'' Moira Cholerton from Hertford has asked for more help in tracing relatives from Llanidloes : `` The one line I have been unable to trace is that of his daughter Isabel -LRB- aka Isabella -RRB- Owen\\/Owens -LRB- b 1831 , Llandysilio , Mont. -RRB- . In 19 August 1851 , at Trinity Church , Shrewsbury , she married John Roberts of Bangor , a miner and son of a farmer , John Roberts . Their daughter Isabel Ellen Roberts was born on 25 November 1852 in Llanidloes . At that time John was living in Corris , Merionethshire . A second daughter , Catherine Ann Roberts -LRB- Newtown 1854 4th qt -RRB- , was born in Llanidloes on 12 November 1854 . At the time of the 1861 census Catherine was with her grandparents , James and Susannah Owen , in Montgomery whilst her sister and mother were living in the parish of Llandysilio , Mont. . Isabel was a dressmaker , as she had been in 1851 , and her husband was not with the family . In the 1871 census Catherine , 16 , was with her aunt , Sarah Ann Shelby and family in Bersham , Denbighshire and her occupation was `` NK '' . However Catherine was present at James 's death in May 1886 when she was `` of the Royal Infirmary , Manchester '' so she may have become a nurse . I have been unable to find any of the family in later UK censuses . I was informed that one of her daughters , Nellie -LRB- presumably Isabella -RRB- , married James Slater and had children , Bella and Idris . Further , that James was a quarry proprietor in Delta , Pennsylvania . In the US census of 1880 I found an Isabella Roberts , 18 , born in Wales of Welsh parentage living in Philadelphia . This is likely to be the Isabella I sought as I 've found no other young lady of that name , of the appropriate age and born in Wales in previous censuses . Unfortunately the only other member of the household is a housekeeper . I was also told that a great granddaughter of Isabel -LRB- nee Owen -RRB- was living in North Wales in the middle of the last century .

Janice Long is joined tonight by the legendary Sir Tom Jones for a special session and chat , recorded in the BBC 's Maida Vale studios . Presenter\\/Janice Long , Producer\\/Mark Plant for the BBC Forget Samuel Sebastian Wesley as a pillar of the Anglican Cathedral world . He was an eccentric , inconsistent and irascible character , who frequently abandoned his Sunday duties of conducting the choir or playing the organ to visit the nearest river for fishing . His life is one of regret , having left the world of musical opportunities in London at an early age to be considered , from that point , a composer of church music . His career spans many churches and cathedrals , most of which he resigned from due to circumstances relating to his neglect of duties , and his outspoken views concerning the clergy 's power over music . Wesley is largely forgotten today , but during his time he was rated highly by the likes of Gounod , Parry and Elgar , and he even got to perform duets with Rossini -- his father was also a celebrated composer . Other relatives of note include his great uncle John Wesley -LRB- the preacher -RRB- and his grandfather Charles -LRB- the hymn writer -RRB- . However , SS Wesley was illegitimate , and he and his siblings were largely shunned by their extended family . Donald Macleod marks the bicentenary of Wesley 's birth , surveying the life and music of this bad-tempered composer . His career took him from London to Hereford , then on to Exeter and Leeds , moving on again to Winchester and then Gloucester . However , Wesley , for most of his life , wished to return to Devon where he 'd been happiest in that rural landscape , fishing in the local streams and rivers . He eventually got his wish upon his deathbed , being returned to Exeter to be buried next to his baby daughter . Throughout the week there are a number of recordings made specially for the series , including performances by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales , the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra , the BBC Singers and former New Generation artist , pianist Tom Poster -- including an anthem not heard since 1854 . In the first of this week 's explorations of Wesley 's life and music , Donald looks at the composer 's childhood and early career , including rare works such as his Piano Waltz , the Benedictus for voices and piano and the orchestral Overture in E. Valery Gergiev and the London Symphony Orchestra perform the scintillating ballet score for The Firebird , which Stravinsky wrote 100 years ago for Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes . Based on the Russian folktale of the exotic Firebird imprisoned by the evil magician Kashchey , the work made him famous overnight . Scriabin too was nothing if not ambitious : in his Symphony No. 1 in E major he began his symphonic output with a massive work in six movements , complete with a choral finale in praise of art and including two solo vocal roles , taken tonight by members of Gergiev 's Mariinsky Theatre . This Prom is repeated on Monday 23 August at 2pm . Susan Hitch explores the life and work of Boris Pasternak , Nobel Prize-winning poet and author , who died 50 years ago . Her guests on stage at the Proms Literary Festival are Jonathan Myerson , who dramatised Dr Zhivago for the BBC , and Professor of Russian Donald Rayfield . Pasternak is most famous in the UK for his sprawling epic novel Dr Zhivago which sets the concerns , desires and stories of individuals in the vast landscape of Russian revolutionary politics and history . Susan and guests discuss the circumstances of the book 's publication : it was smuggled out of Russia during the height of the Cold War , and the subsequent film adaptation by David Lean made Pasternak a global literary hero . But does that tell the real story of Pasternak ? Myserson and Rayfield explore the misunderstood complexity of the novel , and the fact that the compromises Pasternak adopted in his life mean he 's no straightforward Cold War darling of the West . This week in The Essay , scientists revisit mould-breaking experiments in history . Today , biologist Matthew Cobb ruminates on the quest for spontaneously generated life . In the sweltering heat of a 17th-century Tuscan villa , surrounded by jars of putrefying meat , Francesco Redi doubts the idea , handed down from Aristotle , and accepted unquestioningly by his contemporaries , that insects and reptiles emerge without parents from dead flesh . The painstaking experiments not only established the notion of testing theories by exhaustive experimentation , but also laid the foundations of modern ideas of continuous heredity in all life . Monday 16 to Friday 20 August Stuart Kelly examines the powerful images of Scotland created by Sir Walter Scott . His name , image and influence can be seen everywhere , from Scottish banknotes to place names across the globe . Sir Walter Scott invented the modern novel , began Scotland 's tourist industry and was the first celebrity author . Lauded by contemporary critics and his impressive readership in the 19th century , today he is hardly ever read . Stuart examines Scott 's contradictory legacy as best-selling bankrupt , iconic unknown and the Tory defender of the Union who fought to save Scotland 's banking independence . Stuart considers the influential images of his own country created by Scott -- the stereotype of the kilted native dwelling within rugged , romantic landscapes -- images that haunt Scotland to this day . Stuart was born and grew up in the Scottish Borders . He studied English at Oxford and is the literary editor of Scotland on Sunday . The book is abridged by Laurence Wareing . Presenter\\/Stuart Kelly , Producer\\/Eilidh McCreadie for the BBC Monday 16 to Friday 20 August The nation 's favorite agony uncle , Mr Spectator , returns for a second series to offer his wit and wisdom on the morals and manners of his countrymen in his daily writings . London 1710 ; political upheaval , national debt , spin -- and in the midst of it all , a young , eager and naive Ned Dempsey has just arrived in the capital , determined to make his way in the big city . With Britain in debt to the tune of # 9m , Chief Minister and Lord of the Treasury , Robert Harley , has a plan to raise the funds the country so desperately needs . However , he requires public support to get his bill through Parliament and to do that he needs someone influential to speak out in support of his scheme . Someone with the ear of the country , someone people respect , someone people turn to , listen to and obey -- someone like Mr Spectator ! Enlisting the aid of Palace paperboy Ned , Harley determines to track down the elusive Mr Spectator in order to convince him to come out in support of the bill before it goes before the House on Friday . In his quest , Ned is swept along in a mercenary world of spin and manipulation , where he must question whether anyone is really who they seem , and whether everything and everyone has their price . The cast stars Benjamin Whitrow as Mr Spectator , Bryan Dick as Ned Dempsey , David Schofield as Harley , Christina Cole as Abigail , Jemma Redgrave as Queen Anne , Claire Rushbrook as Anne Baldwin , Sam Dale as Defoe , Stella McCusker as Aunt Maude and David Revels as the Opera Singer . The drama is adapted by Elizabeth Kuti from Addison and Steele 's Spectator essays . Producer\\/Heather Larmour for the BBC A-level results come out soon and some of the pupils who gave it their all will achieve the newly introduced A \\* grade . To find out what it takes to achieve the new A \\* grade at A-level , actress Imogen Stubbs enlists the help of actor Adam Long and director Trevor Nunn -- Imogen 's husband -- who agree to sit an English exam . Imogen has watched her children go through the agonising experience of exams and has often wondered who the people are who set the questions and how they mark them . In this program , Imogen goes on a quest to discover what the magic ingredient is to achieve the new A \\* and talks to teachers , pupils and examiners on her journey . Adam and Trevor both agree to sit one A-level Shakespeare exam question to see how they get on when they have it graded by a genuine examiner who does not know who they are .

There 's a flurry of excitement in the village . Mr Kismet from the World Development Agency has sent a letter offering rich rewards if the region sells its timber and moves to cut-flower production .

The cast stars Jude Akuwudike as Mr Job , Adjoa Andoh as Mrs Job , Danny Sapani as Mr Eliphaz , Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Mr Bildad , Lloyd Thomas as Mr Achebe and Paul Courtney Hyu as Mr Lucy . Producer\\/Claire Grove for the BBC Mike Thomson returns for a new series of BBC Radio 4 's investigative history program which examines documents that shed new light on past events . The series begins with a paper trail surrounding an oil disaster -- not the most recent example in the Gulf of Mexico but one much closer to home , in the North Sea . While President Obama has told BP that it will be held fully responsible for cleaning up the damage caused by the massive oil spill off the American coast , papers seen by Document show that the oil company Occidental got off far more lightly after the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988 off the Scottish coast , which left 167 people dead . After seeing the recently released documents , the environmental pressure group Greenpeace claims too little was done to deal with more than five tons of highly toxic chemicals released in the disaster . The documents also shed light on the decision to topple the remains of the Piper Alpha platform , an operation that threatened to worsen contamination and was fiercely opposed by relatives who wanted the search for bodies to continue . Mike speaks to marine biologists , politicians from the time and survivors to find out if more should have been done to clean up after the disaster .

Listeners are invited to join Andrew McGregor as we step inside the bow maker 's workshop , following the master craftsman who needs to be engineer , woodcarver and silversmith . Twenty Minutes reveals how precision and technical skill are only the foundation of the art and examines the modern-day issues facing bow makers -- such as how Pernambuco , a rare Brazilian hardwood which has been used in the making of string bows for more than 250 years , has been driven to the point of extinction . With insights from violinists Rachel Podger and Daniel Hope , listeners discover the difference a good bow can make and how the bow continues to evolve today . The thoughtful , dignified , spacious music of Estonian composer Arvo Prt has become one of the most distinctive sounds in contemporary music . This evening 's Late Night Prom presents a performance of a choral work which summarises his unassuming and deceptively simple style -- a setting of the Christian Passion narrative from the Gospel according to St John . Prt 's St John Passion is not a work in which the harrowing events of Christ 's arrest , trial , crucifixion and death are used as the vehicle for large-scale , overly dramatic musical gestures . Rather , the piece makes its impact through quiet understatement and ritualised intensity -- the music only occasionally raising its voice . In a noisy , over-emotionalised , hyper-sensitive contemporary world Prt 's piece takes listeners to a place of deep contemplation and solemn ceremony -- sounding both fresh and modern , and -- at the same time -- as if it springs from some great well of primeval music . The concert features the BBC Singers with tenor Andrew Kennedy as Pilate and baritone Brindley Sherratt as Jesus , Iain Farrington is the organist and David Hill the conductor . Quentin Letts returns with another series of What 's The Point Of ... offering a witty and thought-provoking look at some of Britain 's cherished institutions . Over the next four weeks Quentin casts a quizzical eye over Marylebone Cricket Club , the public library , the Kennel Club and , in the first of the new series , the RAF . As the nation commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , Quentin asks whether we still need an independent air force in 2010 . Britain was the first country in the world to have an independent air force , so to even consider eradicating it would be unthinkable , surely . Defense secretary Liam Fox has promised that the government 's strategic defense review will be ruthless and unsentimental . The RAF 's critics claim that a bloated higher command structure in Whitehall argues for unaffordable fast jets for a war the country wo n't be fighting . And many say its uniforms are horrible and they ca n't march properly ! Historian Max Hastings , war correspondent Sam Kiley , former defense secretary Geoff Hoon and retired colonel Tim Collins are among those who join Quentin to ask the question , what is the point of the RAF ? Presenter\\/Quentin Letts , Producer\\/Rosemary Dawson for the BBC Dr Hilary Jones explores the history of obesity , from the fairground to the tabloids . The media , government and medical reports all over the world echo the same sentiment -- the obesity epidemic has arrived . But obesity is as old as mankind . In this series , Dr Hilary looks back into its history , and asks what can be learned today from the mistakes and successes of overweight ancestors . The series starts with an investigation of the immensely corpulent individuals who put themselves on show to the public . It begins in Stamford -- scene of the death and extraordinary burial of Daniel Lambert , hailed in 1809 as `` the most corpulent man in the history of the world '' . Professor Vanessa Toulmin of the National Fairground Archive and Professor David Haslam , chair of the National Obesity Forum , explore the world of circus obese folk . And from America , listeners can hear a snatch of the Strates Carnival in 1941 , featuring Big Bertha and Slim Jim , `` the world 's strangest married couple '' . Times have changed , and nowadays the idea of obese individuals exhibiting in freak shows is highly uncomfortable . But is the portrayal of obesity in sensationalist , prurient tabloid articles and on TV , the modern-day equivalent of the freak show ? Other programs in the series explore depictions of obesity in art , music and literature ; diets through the ages ; and the weird , wonderful and downright dangerous obesity remedies of the past . Presenter\\/Dr Hilary Jones , Producer\\/Susan Kenyon for Ladbroke Productions In the final program of In Living Memory , Jolyon Jenkins explores the rise of the ostrich investment mania of the Nineties -- and why it all went so badly wrong . In the mid-Nineties , companies sprung up offering huge returns on ostrich farming . Ostrich fever took hold , and birds changed hands at 10 times their true market value . It seemed too good to be true -- and it was . The Department of Trade moved in and closed down the companies on the grounds that that they were running pyramid schemes . In the case of the biggest company , the Ostrich Farming Corporation , an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office revealed that the directors had also been siphoning off millions of pounds into offshore accounts , and three directors went to prison . In this program , Jolyon tries to discover why so many apparently intelligent people fell for the ostrich scams . He discovers what happened to the ostriches when the Ostrich Farming Corporation collapsed , and he follows the fortunes of the two companies , each run by retired military officers , which were set up to try to carry on ostrich farming . Presenter and Producer\\/Jolyon Jenkins for the BBC Sheila McClennon discovers how a tiny venue in a converted Paris chapel became one of the most popular and infamous venues in the country 's theatrical history . At the end of the 19th century , in the seediest quarter of Paris , a new theater opened its doors offering a recipe of blood and terror . Soon the Grand Guignol was to become as big an attraction in the city as the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe . The success of an evening 's performance -- made up of a succession of short comedy and horror plays -- was measured by how many members of the audience fainted , as they witnessed gougings , garrottings and gory murders on a nightly basis . After more than 60 years the theater finally closed its doors , but only after helping influence the development of horror in the cinema , as well as introducing the phrase Grand Guignol into common parlance as a byword for shocking , blood-soaked terror . In this program , Sheila visits Paris to revisit the scene of this most shocking of theater movements , she also goes to London to find out how the likes of Joseph Conrad and Noel Coward got involved in its English incarnation , which fought a staunch but unsuccessful battle with the censors at the beginning of the Twenties . Presenter\\/Sheila McClennon , Producer\\/Geoff Bird for the BBC Professor Robert Winston concludes his exploration of the relationship between the music and medical conditions of composers who suffered mental and physical illness . Peter Warlock was the pseudonym of Philip Heseltine , a troubled British composer who died of apparent suicide in 1930 . Professor Winston wades through the many colorful and outrageous episodes in his life to investigate if the apparent `` Jekyll and Hyde '' quality in his character and his music was the result of a serious psychological condition . Presenter\\/Professor Robert Winston , Producer\\/Chris Taylor for the BBC Michael Butt 's innovative drama delves into one of most illusive events in English literary history -- the killing of the playwright Christopher Marlowe in May 1593 . This drama dons the cloak of documentary to get into the heart of the Elizabethan plot . The story is told through first-hand testimonies and interviews and explores the anatomy of a killing through the eyes of the witnesses . The scene is Deptford on 30 May 1593 . Four gentlemen enter a tavern . They order lunch , take a room above the public bar and ask for privacy . The official story was that a fight resulted after an argument regarding the bill . All four gentlemen dealt in the perennial currency of that day : bargains , tricks , betrayals and lies . The narrator opens the play while crouching next to Marlowe 's dead body , now growing cold . Over the next 45 minutes he speaks to the people who knew Marlowe and enters a world of half-truths and outright lies , as he tries to elicit answers that will finally lead to the truth . The cast stars Paul Rhys as Narrator , Blake Ritson as Thomas Walsingham , Harry Lloyd as Thomas Kyd , Burn Gorman as Robert Poley , Tim McMullan as Lord Cecil , Christine Kavanagh as Mrs Bull , Tony Bell as Ingram Frizer , Sam Dale as Richard Baines , Sean Baker as Cambridge Porter and Lloyd Thomas as Drew Woodleff .

Readers\\/Julia McKenzie , Laurel Lefkow and Morven Christie , Producer\\/Gemma Jenkins for the BBC Disgraced American President Richard Nixon Matthew Parris invites historian Dominic Sandbrook to explain why the life of disgraced American President Richard Nixon is , to him , a great one . The disgrace and resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974 was a profoundly traumatic moment in the history of the American presidency , leaving the world with the endlessly influential word `` Watergate '' and a cynicism about politics that arguably has only now , with Barack Obama , started to heal . Hence Nixon 's life is perhaps a strange one to nominate as `` great '' , but Dominic unhesitatingly selects him for celebration in this program . Matthew talks to him about his intriguing choice , and calls on Professor Philip Davies of the Eccles Centre for American Studies to fill out the picture . Presenter\\/Matthew Parris , Producer\\/Christine Hall for the BBC Tim McInnerny and Andrew Sachs star in a comedy about the staff of an antiques shop , in the final part of the BBC Radio and Television collaboration showcasing new comedy pilots . Sassy , cutting , clever , perceptive and in desperate need of a job , Faye Chambers is new to the team . She joins Rupert Bull , an old school bounder and cad who has somehow managed to survive into the 21st century , and Toby Atkins , his useless but enthusiastic assistant manager . Rupert won the shop in a poker competition many years ago , and sees it as little more than a way to make a fast buck .

Formed in 2005 by three young multi-instrumentalists -- Rhiannon Giddens , Dom Flemons and Justin Robinson -- the Drops perform traditional music from the Piedmont region of the Carolinas , as well as string band versions of 21st-century hits . The three members first met via an internet group and went on to visit and learn from old `` black fiddler '' Joe Thompson , who passed on to them tunes that had been in his family for generations . Their name is a nod to Thirties African-American country blues band the Tennessee Chocolate Drops .

Presenters\\/Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie , Producer\\/Viv Atkinson for Smooth Operations Legendary Welsh film star Richard Burton BBC Radio 2 takes another trip to the movies this summer , profiling further luminaries of the silver screen . The first actor in the spotlight in the BBC Radio 2 At The Movies season is the late , great Richard Burton . Michael Sheen grew up in the shadow of the steel and coal industries of South Wales , but there was another towering figure in his youth as he started showing signs of what was to become a glittering acting career . That figure was his fellow South Walian Richard Burton . Rich , as he was known to his friends , was one of the world 's richest and most famous men in his day . But above all else , he was a proud Welshman and an actor of extraordinary power , both on stage and on screen . And then of course there were the exploits beyond drama . His marriage to Elizabeth Taylor dominated the tabloids of the Sixties and his reputation as a drinker is legendary . In this program Michael looks back at the Burton legacy with the help of a selection of family , friends and colleagues , including Burton 's last wife Salley ; his nephew Guy Masterson ; his close friend Robert Hardy ; his biographer Melvyn Bragg ; and film critic Barry Norman . And there 's also plenty of the man himself , with that extraordinary voice -- suffused with `` coal dust and rain '' , according to Burton himself . Michael aims to measure how much of Burton 's life and work still resonates today , be it the stage performances that entranced audiences ; the films ; or the myth he made , including the grand passion with Taylor for which he sacrificed a family and became pursued by paparazzi . But the Burton legacy may be at its most lasting in his championing of the people he revered above all others . A copy of Shakespeare 's plays was always at his side , and he cherished poets : Hopkins , Donne and , perhaps above all others , his friend Dylan Thomas . One of the greatest treasures in the BBC archive is Under Milk Wood and there , beguiling listeners , is the Burton voice at its very best . Presenter\\/Michael Sheen , Producer\\/Tom Alban for the BBC After a dramatic overture by Beethoven , depicting the heroic Roman general Coriolanus , the orchestra focuses on music from its homeland . Rachmaninov is a composer close to the heart of soloist Nikolai Lugansky , who performs the radiant and inventive piano variations Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini . Tchaikovsky 's orchestral Suite No. 3 in G major was initially conceived as a symphony , but he found this form to be more flexible , and he also included a set of flamboyant variations at the end . This Prom will be repeated on Wednesday 1 September at 2.40 pm . Stephen Fry investigates whether men and women really use and understand language differently , as his series exploring the highways and byways of the English language continues . As a former presenter on Woman 's Hour , Sue MacGregor has a unique insight into the way men used to use language to patronise or dominate , and recalls one of her guests on the program referring to her as `` my dear '' . But as women began to win equality there was a genuine need to discover whether and how women and men differed in the way they spoke . This program tries to uncover the truth , with the aid of academics , a sex change surgeon , a speech therapist and a bit of comedy from Ronnie Barker . Presenter\\/Stephen Fry , Producer\\/Ian Gardhouse for Testbed Productions Edward Stourton revisits a debate from the archives about the origins of the Second World War , as he continues his series reconsidering passionate broadcast debates of the Sixties and Seventies and exploring the ideas , the great minds behind them and echoes of the arguments in present-day politics . From 1961 , historians AJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper engage in a fiery confrontation over the origins of the Second World War . AJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper were two big-name historians and the `` telly dons '' of their time . In 1961 the fall-out from the war was still fresh in the minds of the British people . Taylor had just published his provocative revision of the orthodox view of the causes of the war in 1939 -- that Britain had scuppered a lunatic dictator 's plans for world domination . Taylor argued , instead , that Hitler was a rational statesman who carried out the expected foreign policies of any German leader , and that a war against Britain and France was unintended . In the studio dissecting the debate is Adam Sisman , biographer of both AJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper , and Richard Evans , regius professor of Modern History at Cambridge . Presenter\\/Edward Stourton , Producer\\/Dominic Byrne for Blakeway Productions Claudia Hammond presents more case studies that help unravel the mysteries of the human mind . Today 's program details the remarkable case of a young boy who underwent a gender reassignment operation . Janet and Ron Reimer 's twin sons , Bruce and Brian , were born in Winnipeg in Canada in August 1965 . All went well until April 1966 , when the twins were circumcised . In the process , Bruce suffered a catastrophic injury to his penis . A year later , on the advice of Dr John Money , founder of the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins University Medical Centre in Baltimore , Bruce became Brenda and the Reimers began to raise their son as a daughter . Yet by the time Brenda was a teenager she was suicidal . When her parents finally told her the truth , Brenda decided to change back to her original gender ; she became David Reimer . As a man , David appeared finally to have found happiness in marriage and stepchildren . However , a series of events took their toll : his twin brother 's death , the loss of his job and separation from his wife all proved too much and he took his own life on 4 May 2004 . Presenter\\/Claudia Hammond , Producer\\/Marya Burgess for the BBC Alistair McGowan stars as a late-night BBC Radio 4 continuity announcer in this subversive new sitcom . A continuity announcer 's booth can be a lonely place -- especially on the late shift , when you 've barely seen your wife and children for a week . But this Radio 4 continuity announcer is a consummate professional , and he 's not going to let his own insignificant little problems get in the way of everybody else 's listening pleasure -- especially when there are so many exciting programs coming up for him to describe to listeners . Alistair McGowan stars as the continuity announcer brooding on the escalating disasters of his private and professional life at the same time as attempting to give listeners a preview of the programs on offer in the coming week on Radio 4 . Written by Hugh Rycroft -- stalwart of The News Quiz and co-creator of Parliamentary Questions and Life , Death And Sex With Mike And Sue -- the series also features the voices of Lewis Macleod , Sally Grace , Charlotte Page and David Holt .

It was 1,400 years ago , in the year 610 of the Common Era , that a man meditating in a cave near Mecca had an experience that was to change the course of history . As he reported later , the Angel of Revelation appeared before him , grabbed him and commanded , `` Recite ! '' . Despite the man 's initial confusion , the encounter ended with the revelation of the first portion of what was to become the holy book of Islam -- the Quran . To mark the anniversary , Razia Iqbal explores the beginnings of the text that continues to inspire Muslims and non-Muslims around the world . She finds out why the oral tradition of memorising and reciting the Quran continues to be so powerful 1,400 years after Prophet Muhammad 's closest followers first learned it by heart , and she meets children who eagerly compete in Britain 's national Quran recitation contest . At the British Museum , Razia discovers the history of one of the oldest surviving copies of the Quran , and another one written entirely in gold . She also finds out what it means that the sacred text has now moved into cyberspace , available to download as text , facsimile , in translation or audio . Where does that leave the traditional reverence for the Quran ? A London imam -- a self-confessed techno-geek -- provides some surprising answers .

Presenter\\/Jo Whiley , Producer\\/BBC Radio 2 Live Music Nigel Ogden turns the clock back with a program of popular organ recordings from the 78rpm era which have been re-released on CD . The players include Sidney Torch , Reginald Dixon and Dudley Beavan on instruments that , with one notable exception , ca n't be heard today . The Compton organ installed in St George 's Hall in London , the home of the BBC Variety Department , was known as BBC Theatre Organ No. 1 but was destroyed during an air raid in 1940 . It 's played by Reginald Foort with Alfredo Campoli on violin . Dudley Beavan plays the small but extremely effective Wurlitzer that ended up in the Granada , Clapham Junction ; and Harry Davidson , who became better known as a dance band leader , plays one of the few installations in the UK by the Dutch firm Standaart at The Commodore Theatre in Hammersmith . The Wurlitzer at Blackpool 's Tower Ballroom has been active since 1935 and is the only organ in the program which can still be heard live today . It 's played by Reginald Dixon , who recorded hundreds of 78s at its famous console . Before 1941 Sidney Torch regularly displayed his mastery of the theater organ , demonstrating a technical expertise that was second to none . After that he hardly ever touched it as he embarked on a glittering career as an orchestral conductor , composer and arranger , but tonight 's program ends with his creation around the song There 's Something About A Soldier played on the Christie Organ at the Regal , Marble Arch , London .

Presenter\\/Sir Tim Rice , Producers\\/Anthony Cherry and Ruth Beazley for the BBC Michael Buerk talks to Romy Tiongco about his choice to risk his life challenging corruption in the Philippines , as the series exploring the processes behind his guests ' life-altering decisions continues . Romy fought against poverty and corruption before leaving to live in Britain with his wife . Upon his return to the Philippines he found himself drawn back into a dangerous and murky world which presented him with the most difficult choice of his life . After Romy 's best friend was killed , people called upon him to challenge corruption by standing for political office -- a decision that would put his own life on the line . Romy talks to Michael about the dilemmas he faced and how he came to make his decision . Presenter\\/Michael Buerk , Producer\\/Amanda Hancox for the BBC David Bowie 's mythical rock star Ziggy Stardust was inspired by British-born singer Vince Taylor , as Martyn Day discovers in this documentary . Ziggy Stardust was a rock 'n' roll fantasy . But David Bowie 's fictional rock star , around whom his 1972 album , stage show and film were built , was inspired by a real performer : Vince Taylor , born in Isleworth , Middlesex . Vince Taylor made a name for himself in the early days of rock 'n' roll in London and , later , France . This program uncovers the truth about a singer whose wild lifestyle ultimately destroyed him , but in so doing gave rise to a myth that transcended glam rock and science fiction . His record Brand New Cadillac remains to this day a British rock 'n' roll classic , covered later by The Clash . But Vince was frustrated by his limited success in Britain and , already displaying the unpredictable behavior and volcanic temper that were to dog him for the rest of his days , moved to France where he was dubbed Le diable noir -- the Black Devil . Decked out in black leathers , chains , kohl eye make-up and with his hair greased up into a high pompadour , he was immediately signed to the French Barclay label . But , fuelled by alcohol and drugs , Vince 's behavior became increasingly erratic . At a party he tried LSD for the first time . In his state of mind at the time it was the last thing that he needed . Vince Taylor underwent a kind of public breakdown at his next gig , where he started claiming he was a divine being . David Bowie bumped into him in London and later said : `` Vince Taylor was the inspiration for Ziggy ... he always stayed in my mind as an example of what can happen in rock 'n' roll . I 'm not sure if I held him up as an idol or as something not to become . There was something very tempting about him going completely off the edge . '' The program , presented by Martyn Day , tracks down many of the people who worked with Taylor , including members of his original band and his family . Presenter\\/Martyn Day , Producer\\/Bob Dickinson for the BBC Poet Paul Farley investigates the compulsion of some men to collect wild birds ' eggs . Paul went `` egging '' as a boy , guarding his guilty secret until now . He examines what the attraction is and how some men never outgrow it , even if egging lands them in prison . Generations of boys have robbed nests during their childhoods . Most grow out of it , making a moral journey towards a less rapacious relationship with the natural world . But some do n't , and this can have terrible consequences for both birds and men : the red-backed shrike became extinct in Britain because its beautiful speckled eggs proved irresistible to collectors . This happened as recently as the Eighties , even though it has been illegal to steal eggs from nests since 1954 . Punishment then was limited to a fine , related to the offender 's ability to pay , but the law was no deterrent to people such as Colin Watson . He offended repeatedly , paid fines totalling # 6,000 and was once caught trying to fell a tree with a chainsaw to get at an osprey 's nest . He tumbled from a tree while trying to reach a nest in 2005 , and died , killed by his obsession . In 2001 a change in the law meant egg collectors faced prison . Several were apprehended in Operation Easter by detectives from the National Wildlife Crime Unit . It is now pursuing 70 suspected collectors in Britain and is liaising with Interpol ; as Alan Stewart of Tayside Police reveals , cheap flights have led to `` egg-collecting tourism '' . Mark Thomas , investigation officer with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , believes that while the recent sentences are significant , they are not doing enough . Paul Farley talks to those involved on both sides of the law , including John Dodsworth , who has a number of convictions relating to egg collecting . He speaks about his passion and his love of nature , and says that he feels he has done no harm and has been treated unjustly . Farly visits the headquarters of the RSPB where Mark Thomas shows him some of the confiscated egg collections , which include red-backed shrike eggs . Here he reads the journals of Colin Watson .

Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra celebrate Arvo Prt 's 75th birthday with the UK premire of his Fourth Symphony , plus classics by Ravel , Scriabin and Mosolov . Esa-Pekka Salonen has been principal conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra for less than two years , but his distinctive programming and conducting has already made its mark on London 's concert life , and their BBC Prom together epitomises their relationship . It starts with a bang -- Alexander Mosolov 's futuristic aural picture of industrial Twenties Soviet Russia in The Foundry -- and continues with a UK premire from Estonian composer Arvo Prt -- his Symphony No. 4 , Los Angeles , bringing to a climax the BBC Proms celebrations of his 75th birthday . Two early 20th-century classics complete the program : Ravel 's remarkable piano concerto for the left hand only , with Jean-Efflam Bavouzet as soloist , and a sensual orchestral showpiece from Scriabin -- The Poem Of Ecstasy . This Prom will be broadcast on BBC Four at 7.30 pm tonight , and is repeated on BBC Radio 3 on Thursday 26 August at 2.45 pm . Before Ravel 's Concerto For The Left Hand in tonight 's BBC Prom concert , novelist Louise Doughty investigates the influence left-handedness has on creativity , including her own . After losing his right hand in the First World War pianist Paul Wittgenstein commissioned several composers to write pieces specifically for the left hand , including Ravel , whose Concerto For The Left Hand is performed in tonight 's Prom concert . But why , as 10 per cent of the population is left-handed , should it take such a loss for composers to consider doing this ? Why -LRB- especially as the incidence of left-handedness is even higher among musicians -RRB- are musical instruments designed by right-handers , for right-handers ? Louise Doughty is left-handed and feels this has had considerable bearing on her becoming a writer . There is a preconception that left-handers are more creative than most of the population , more likely to develop as artists . Louise enquires into the truth of this , talking to Chris McManus , Professor of Psychology and Medical Education at University College London and the author of Right Hand , Left Hand , a book about handedness and asymmetry .

In the first program , Punt looks into the phantom settlement of Argleton . Search the web for this quintessentially English place name and internet maps show that it lies just outside the town of Ormskirk in Lancashire . But when the super sleuth travels to locate it on the ground , all he finds is an empty field . It turns out that Argleton does n't actually exist ! Punt sets out to crack the mystery of how a non-existent place can appear in online maps . From the Domesday Book to Google Headquarters , Punt 's quest takes him through a thousand years of history and into the murky world of plagiarism .

Producer\\/Emma Harding for the BBC Dr Brian Cox presents a tribute to fellow physicist Richard Feynman Following on from his archive portrait of Carl Sagan , physicist Dr Brian Cox presents a tribute to Richard Feynman in this week 's Archive On 4 . Widely regarded as the finest physicist of his generation and the most influential since Einstein , Feynman did much to popularize science through lectures , books and television , including his dramatic revelation before the world 's media in which he demonstrated the exact cause of the Challenger Shuttle explosion in 1986 . Described as the `` Mozart of physics '' , Feynman 's amazing life and career seemingly had no end of highlights including a shared Nobel Prize for his unique contribution to the field of Quantum Electrodynamics . He became the most celebrated , influential and best known American physicist of his generation -- something that would continue until his death from cancer in 1988 . At the same time as his scientific reputation was building , Feynman 's unconventional attitude and behavior were helping to create his reputation for eccentricity . When bored of writing equations on chalk boards or lecturing in his lab , he would go off in search of inspiration down at the local strip club , watching the go-go girls and scribbling his calculations on napkins . His eccentricity would at times infuriate his colleagues but it was simply a natural consequence of how he thought . Brian explores how , though few ever understood mathematics or physics like Feynman , he truly believed that science was simply too important to be left exclusively to scientists , and his energy and humor was essential in getting the public interested and inspired .

The program will feature live inserts from Cofton Park for the Beatification Mass of Cardinal John Henry Newman . Presenter\\/Aled Jones , Producer\\/Hilary Robinson for the BBC Excitement mounts as thousands gather to greet the Pope in London 's Hyde Park . Sunday Half Hour 's Brian D'Arcy meets and talks with visitors and pilgrims from all corners of the country and introduces music from the event celebrating the life of faith . The Papal Vigil provides Catholics in England , Scotland and Wales the chance not only to celebrate their faith but also to explain it and demonstrate how it influences their lives and the lives of those around them . Hymns , psalms , worship songs , gospel -- a huge variety of music and musicians accompany the crowds gathered there . People representing each parish from across the UK carry banners in procession alongside members of Catholic organizations . Cardinal Newman 's phrase `` Heart speaks unto heart '' inspires a presentation called The Heart Of The Church . Christian organizations use that phrase to illustrate their work as a heart that sees , a heart that understands , a heart that serves and a heart that seeks justice . The Vigil Liturgy that follows consists of readings , prayers and an address by the Pope and concludes with Benediction . The visit of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI has been described by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as an `` unprecedented opportunity to strengthen ties between the UK and the Holy See on global initiatives , and to emphasise the important role of faith in creating strong communities '' . Presenter\\/Brian D'Arcy , Producers\\/Clair Jaquiss and Mark O'Brien for the BBC Prize-winning Scottish novelist and poet Jackie Kay talks to Michael Berkeley about her favorite music , from Bach and Schubert to Janek , Richard Strauss and Nina Simone . Kay 's musical favorites begin with one of Janek 's Lachian Dances -LRB- two of her stories were influenced by works by Janek -RRB- , and then move on to the Baroque era with an extract from Pergolesi 's Stabat mater and a movement from a Bach cello suite played by Pablo Casals . Stephen Johnson explores Holst 's The Planets , with extracts and a complete performance of the work performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales , conducted by David Atherton . Originally titled Seven Pieces For Large Orchestra , Gustav Holst 's The Planets was a remarkably original composition when it was written . The first movement , Mars , the Bringer of War , was conceived in 1914 , just before the outbreak of the First World War ; almost foreseeing rather than reacting to war . The work was forward-looking in many ways -- Holst scored the work for a huge orchestra , creating extraordinary sounds and colors from this vast orchestral palette , and each movement has strikingly original characteristics . Samuel West plays Faust in Goethe 's classic drama Samuel West , Sir Derek Jacobi , Toby Jones and Anna Maxwell Martin star in Goethe 's Faust , one of the pillars of Western literature , here presented in a version dramatised and directed by David Timson . In part one of tonight 's drama , following an agreement between Mephistopheles and The Lord , the scholar Faust is tempted into a contract with the Devil . His life is changed and he plunges into the enjoyment of sensuality until his emotions are stirred by a meeting with Gretchen , leading to a tragic outcome . Part two of Faust , written much later in Goethe 's life , presents a series of episodic scenes in which the poet places his eponymous hero in a variety of surprising circumstances reflecting the predicament of humanity . Funny , reflective and moving , this dramatisation shows why Goethe 's Faust had such a massive influence on Western culture . Samuel West stars as Faust with Toby Jones as Mephistopheles , Sir Derek Jacobi as The Lord and Anna Maxwell Martin as Gretchen . The cast also includes Stephen Critchlow , Joannah Tincey , Peter Kenny , Emily Raymond , Gunnar Cauthery , Sean Barrett , Hugh Dickson , Anne-Marie Piazza , Gerard Horan , Auriol Smith , Peter Kenny , Emily Raymond and Daniel Mair .

Producer\\/Philip Billson for the BBC Sue MacGregor reunites people involved with the classic children 's TV program Play School , which ran from 1964 to 1988 in the final program of this series of The Reunion . Devised by Joy Whitby , former producer of the Listen With Mother slot on BBC Radio , Play School was a direct response to concerns about the perceived poor standard of British pre-school education . Play School was ground-breaking in more ways than one as it accidentally became the first program to be shown on BBC Two after a power cut halted the opening night 's programming . Its enthusiastic presenters came from diverse backgrounds and became household names and , along with the iconic three shaped windows , clock and toys , formed an integral part of many early childhoods . Sue is joined around the table by Joy along with Play School presenters Floella Benjamin , Brian Cant , who also fronted the spin-off series Play Away , and Johnny Ball , and musical director\\/pianist Jonathan Cohen .

Producer\\/Charlotte Riches for the BBC As the final major event of the Pope 's historic visit to the UK , one of the most distinguished English Catholics of the 19th century , Cardinal Newman , was declared `` Blessed '' at a major open-air ceremony in Birmingham 's Cofton Park near to Newman 's home and oratory church . According to the Catholic Bishops ' Conference of England and Wales and the Bishops ' Conference of Scotland , Newman 's search for truth , his commitment to education and his moderation in debate all point to a man of faith in God , who cared for people and refused to pursue arguments without touching hearts . As the Pope 's visit draws to its conclusion , Edward Stourton presents highlights of this Beatification , commentating on the ceremony and explaining the process of making a saint . In particular , he discusses Newman 's own journey towards sainthood .

In a remarkably wide-ranging , candid and emotional interview , Bernard Sumner recalls his youth ; the formation of Joy Division ; and , with searing honesty , the day the group 's iconic singer , Ian Curtis , committed suicide . He also talks about the band 's musical rebirth as New Order ; how they embraced technology and the emerging dance culture ; their financial troubles ; how he extricated himself from their famously bacchanalian lifestyle ; and the formation of his later bands Electronic and Bad Lieutenant . More than any other form of show business , the musical needs to have something new to say -- or has to find a new way of saying something old , as Michael Ball explains as he presents Breaking The Mould , the third program in a special season of documentaries celebrating The Musical . As the series of programs , each presented by a leading name from the world of musical theater , continues , Michael shows that the musical is a vulnerable medium in that it 's made of so many ingredients -- story , words , music , dance , costume and setting , all of which must come together in a perfect mix if the whole show is to succeed . But one of the constants about musical theater is its ability to evolve . Over the years , a number of shows have broken new ground -- even smashed the mould of what was or was n't a musical -- and have been rewarded with commercial and critical success . Examples in this program include Jesus Christ Superstar , Show Boat , Cats , Chicago and Oklahoma ! Contributors include : Stephen Sondheim , Joel Grey , Maury Yeston , Tim Rice , Elaine Paige , Sandy Wilson , Elaine Stritch , Cameron Mackintosh , Michael Grandage , Gillian Lynne , Ruthie Henshall , Ted Chapin , Mary Rodgers , Marge Champion and Richard Stilgoe . Presenter\\/Michael Ball , Producer\\/Malcolm Prince for the BBC Jools Holland 's special guest on this week 's show is American singer-songwriter Jesse Dee , who joins Jools and his band on an impromptu version of Nothing Can Change This Love . Presenter\\/Jools Holland , Producer\\/Sarah Gaston for the BBC Although he 's responsible for some of the best-known Spanish guitar pieces , Isaac Albniz did n't actually write any of them originally for that instrument . They are all transcriptions and arrangements of some of the wealth of piano music he produced throughout his career . Donald Macleod this week introduces a selection of Albniz 's piano music , both in its original form and in a variety of other guises , including his masterpiece , Iberia . There 's also a chance to hear Albniz 's two pieces for piano and orchestra , his only purely orchestral work , and extracts from his rarely performed operas , which came to fruition thanks to an intriguing collaboration with an English businessman with a passion for poetry . From an early age , Albniz made a good living as a highly respected pianist in his native Spain , and it was n't long before his reputation spread to France and Britain . At first , composition followed in the wake of his performing career , though not for long . As well as producing a large quantity of elegant salon music , Albniz began writing more Spanish-style pieces , in which he adapted traditional dances with their characteristic rhythms and tunes . In this first program , Donald introduces a selection of these works from Albniz 's formative years , including his Rapsodia Espaola . Sean Rafferty introduces a live recital from London 's Wigmore Hall by brilliant young Russian violinist Ilya Gringolts , who is joined by fellow former BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artist , pianist Ashley Wass , for sonatas by Grieg and Schumann . They pair Grieg 's youthful First Sonata , written on holiday in Denmark , with Schumann 's darker and fiery Second Sonata . Monday 20 to Friday 24 September Neil MacGregor explores the impact of Western European travel , trade and conquest between 1450 and 1600 in this week 's A History Of The World In 100 Objects . He begins with an exquisite miniature version of the sort of high-tech vessel that was to take Europeans right around the world . Today 's object is a small clockwork version of the type of galleon that the Spanish sent against England in the Armada , and which they also sent across the high seas . This one was made for a grand dinner table -- it could move , make music , tell the time and fire tiny cannons . Neil discusses the significance of this new breed of sailing ships and describes the political state of which this galleon is a symbol -- the Holy Roman Empire . Marine archaeologist Christopher Dobbs compares the tiny galleon to the Mary Rose in Portsmouth and historian Lisa Jardine considers the European fascination with mechanics and technology throughout the 16th century . Presenter\\/Neil MacGregor , Producer\\/Anthony Denselow for the BBC Against the background of rising hysteria in Middlesbrough over the murders of prostitutes , Denise 's dreams of a happy second marriage , even a family at 40 years old , are challenged as circumstantial evidence seems to point the finger at her husband , Phil . Developed at the Bore Place workshop with the aim of telling a contemporary story with a small cast , Hysteria by Steve Chambers addresses the fragile dynamics of a marriage and the taboo subject of men paying for sex and how a community can so easily be whipped into a suspicious frenzy . Christine Kavanagah plays Denise , Michael Hodgson plays Phil , Celia Hewitt plays Kath , Colleen Prendergast plays Sheree , Sean Baker plays Jimmy , Jude Akuwudike plays John , Sally Orrock plays Nurse and Michael Shelford and Tony Bell play the policemen . Producer\\/David Hunter for the BBC The Last Tudor tells the story of a reality show contestant who decides that he has a greater claim to the throne than the current Royal Family . This improvised drama , told in a documentary format , charts his rise and fall in a satire on celebrity , delusion and spin . The story is based on the true story of Anthony Hall , a former policeman who in 1931 started to give public speeches claiming that he was the descendant of an illegitimate son of Henry VIII and therefore the last Tudor . The drama supposes that Anthony Hall 's great grandson , Murray Gray , a local government employee at Bristol City Council , discovers his family history and decides to exploit the royal claim as part of his bid to win a television talent show called The Fame Factor . He dresses up as Henry VIII to raise money for charitable causes , and seeks pop stardom to escape his boring job dealing with parking fines . Initially the case of Murray Gray is simply one story in a history documentary about Royal pretenders , but as Murray becomes more and more successful in The Fame Factor , events , and the `` documentary '' , spiral out of control . The documentary is presented by real-life presenter and producer Jolyon Jenkins , who devised the drama with Abigail Youngman . Murray Gray is played by Jonathan Alden and his girlfriend Chantelle by Nadia Williams . Murray 's PR agent , Memphis Garfield , is played by real-life music promoter Conal Dodds . Producer\\/Jolyon Jenkins for the BBC Ivan Hewett explores the question of why certain musical keys have become associated with particular moods in a new series of Key Matters . A major , for example , has almost always been employed by composers to write optimistic , even ecstatic music , while in contrast E minor has become the key of choice for portraying menace and tragedy . In Monday 's program , pianist and conductor Jonathan Cohen discusses the open optimism of A major . On Tuesday , Ivan is joined by pianist Kenneth Hamilton to explore the treacherous and obscure world of F sharp . Cellist and composer Philip Sheppard defines the qualities of E minor on Wednesday . On Thursday , French horn player Roger Montgomery explains why F major is traditionally associated with pastoral and hunting sounds . And Ivan ends the week talking with violinist Daniel Hope about the majesty and glory of D major . Presenter\\/Ivan Hewett , Producer\\/Rosie Boulton for the BBC In Exit Strategy -- Choosing A Time To Die , Jenny Cuffe visits an Exit International workshop to explore the issue of assisted dying for the old .

But while the gray areas of the British legal system are floundered over , a radical Australian doctor has found a loophole . As physically helping someone to die is illegal , he is providing information to paying participants on how to `` peacefully and painlessly '' kill themselves . Dr Phillip Nitschke runs Exit International , an organization that distributes information on end-of-life methods . Banned from holding seminars in his own country , he is taking his workshops on the road , including to the UK . Jenny gains exclusive access to an Exit International workshop . She talks to the people present about their reasons for attending and investigates whether Exit is acting in the interests of humanity , or irresponsibly by offering dangerous information without safeguards . Talking with geriatricians , psychologists , campaigners and elderly people , Jenny explores society 's last great taboo : death . Presenter\\/Jenny Cuffe , Producer\\/Gemma Newby for All Out Productions Rosamund Luton 's first novel , Sister , is a suspenseful thriller about the bond between two sisters .

What goes on in the brain when we recognize a friend , feel the position of our limbs , or reach for a cup of coffee ? How many senses do we use to taste a potato chip ? Why do some people see numbers as colored ? This new four-part series , presented by Barry Smith , director of the Institute of Philosophy , examines the surprising answers that contemporary neuroscience is providing to these questions and how these answers are changing our sense of ourselves . The series examines how the experiences we most take for granted are due to the silent and hidden workings of several co-operative systems in the brain . It explores the way these intricate systems create our sense of ourselves and the world around us , and the strange experiences that result when some of these systems stop working . The series includes interviews with some of the world 's leading neuroscientists .

Recollections from musicians who experienced the thrill of seeing Jimi play live provide an eyewitness account that captures the chaos and excitement of Hendrix 's career . The program charts a chronological path through Jimi 's most important performances , beginning with his career as a backing musician for some of the biggest names in soul music and R&B including Ike and Tina Turner , Little Richard , Sam Cooke , the Isley Brothers , BB King and Jackie Wilson . By 1966 Jimi was performing with his own band , Jimmy James and the Blue Flames , in the Caf Wha ? in New York 's Greenwich Village when he was spotted by Keith Richard 's girlfriend , Linda Keith . She mentioned Jimi to the Animals ' bass player , Chas Chandler , who was so impressed that he signed Jimi to a management deal and brought him to London that September . One of Jimi 's first gigs was to jam on the track Killing Floor with Cream at the Regent Polytechnic on London 's Regent Street . Eric Clapton was particularly impressed and that week took Pete Townshend to see Jimi play at the Scotch of St James club in Westminster .

Saba reports from Samburu national park where she and her family have studied the elephants and lions for decades .

Presenter\\/Brett Westwood , Producers\\/Sheena Duncan and Julian Hector for the BBC Tuesday 21 to Thursday 23 September To mark the 50th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik , BBC Radio 4 commissioned Nick Walker to write a short story that recaptured the spirit of American Fifties B-movies . What followed , to enormous acclaim , was The First King Of Mars , the story of the first manned mission to the red planet .

After a landing that could have gone better , the king discovered that there appeared to be no subjects for him to rule over . The progressive disappearance of his crew only made matters worse . Only in the final episode did the intrepid cosmonaut discover that monkeys had already colonised Mars underground , creating a well-ordered and tranquil society -- a Nirvana in fact , so seductive that the crew had never been happier .

Presenter\\/Matthew Parris , Producer\\/Paul Dodgson for the BBC Communities across the UK are being asked to volunteer to host permanent deep storage of the country 's most dangerous radioactive waste . Tonnes of higher level nuclear waste are currently stored at Sellafield in Cumbria , but government policy -- in line with international scientific consensus -- is to find permanent storage , deep underground in a geological repository . But so far , only communities around Sellafield have said they might be interested , and if they have second thoughts , or if the geology of the area is found to be unsuitable , then it 's back to square one . As one of the pioneers of nuclear power , Britain has a mountain of historic waste to deal with , yet -- despite the scale of the UK problem -- other countries are already decades ahead in identifying and developing storage sites hundreds of metres down into the rock . BBC environment correspondent Richard Black visits the Onkalo site in Finland , where the world 's first geological repository , 420m underground , is due to open for business in 10 years ' time . He finds out why the Finns were so enthusiastic about volunteering , even competing , to host this nuclear waste store and considers how the same process , to identify a site here in the UK , could unfold over the crucial next 12 months .

Presenter\\/Neil MacGregor , Producer\\/Anthony Denselow for the BBC 11.30am-12 .00 noon BBC RADIO 4 -LRB- Schedule change 8 September -RRB- Stuart Maconie looks at how to end a piece of music and asks why most classical music has a clear ending , but so much pop music just fades out . An early exception is Haydn 's Farewell Symphony of 1772 , which ends with the players leaving the stage one by one until there are only two players left . Haydn wrote it as a hint that the players needed a break . Holst 's Planets Suite -LRB- written 1914-16 -RRB- ends with a chorus of women 's voices fading into nothing -- perhaps one of the first true examples of a fade in music . At the same time , recording technology was developing and fades could be created by moving away from the recording horn . Record companies began imposing endings for commercial reasons or to fit onto a side of a 78rpm record , sometimes with quite brutal results . With the advent of modern recording techniques it became easy to create a fade electronically , and from the Fifties onwards this became commonplace . But it was in the Sixties when the fade came into its own , particularly with the iconic two-minute fade of The Beatles ' Hey Jude . Stuart , drawing on his own experience as a DJ , talks to Stephen Johnson , presenter of BBC Radio 3 's Discovering Music ; Jacob Smith , a lecturer in Film and Television Studies ; and re-mastering engineer Roger Beardsley . Martyn Ware of Heaven 17 also features to talk about ending live songs that faded out in the studio versions .

It is an American couple , Monty and Janey -- a rather loud duo they stayed with in Delaware years ago . They said : `` If ever you happen to be passing ... '' To Tony 's horror Sal invites them to stay . Then the doorbell rings again . It is Jan and Hilda , a Flemish Belgian couple from Bruges who kindly helped when Janey had a migraine . In gratitude Sal and Tony said , `` If ever you happen to be passing ... '' Then the doorbell goes again -- it is Pierre and Colette , French Belgians who helped them in Namur when Sal was sick .

Presenter\\/Tom Robinson , Producers\\/Adam Hudson and Tom Billington A tale of flying carpets , rockets and dreams , this program examines why people still care about magic in an age of techno-wizardry ... and how it feel when science threatens to make magical objects real . Web-dreaming one day , writer Cathy FitzGerald stumbled on a site belonging to a museum in Iran . It purported to tell the `` true history '' of the flying carpet and detailed its many uses -- military , as a means of aerial attack ; commercial , as a vehicle for the transport of goods ; and cultural , as a device to help readers in the library at Alexandria reach the high books . The article appeared across the web , rarely with any caveat or credit . In search of a `` real '' flying carpet , Cathy tracks down the article 's author , Azhar Abidi , who helps her separate carpet fiction from carpet fact . She goes on to meet a physicist working on levitation in the quantum world , and a Japanese astronaut who took a carpet ride in space .

Prosecutors at the preliminary hearing in Los Angeles have said the drugs combination was lethal and accuse Dr Murray of involuntary manslaughter . He has pleaded not guilty . Mr Martinez , who interviewed Dr Murray two days after Jackson 's death on 25 June 2009 , said the doctor told him the singer had stopped breathing shortly after 1100 . The detective said Dr Murray admitted giving Jackson propofol - the key drug responsible for his death - between 1040 and 1050 . Mr Martinez said Dr Murray told him Jackson fell asleep at about 1100 . The doctor said he then left the room for `` two minutes '' to go to the bathroom but , on returning shortly after 1100 , found the singer had stopped breathing . He started to try to resuscitate Jackson but told Mr Martinez he did not call 911 himself because `` he said he was caring for his patient and he did not want to neglect him '' . Prosecutors say that phone records show the doctor made a series of calls between 1100 and 1200 and that an ambulance was not called until 1221 . Michael Jackson 's family have been attending the hearing Dr Murray administered other drugs - lorazepam , midazolam and valium - to Jackson throughout the night before in an attempt to help the star sleep . Jackson repeatedly told the doctor he would cancel his This Is It concerts in London if he could not sleep and said he wanted his `` milk '' , which was how he referred to propofol . Mr Martinez also said Dr Murray told him he had given Jackson doses of propofol six nights a week for two months but was trying to wean him off the drug as he feared his patient was becoming addicted . Following the preliminary hearing , which could end later this week , a judge will decide if there is enough evidence for Dr Murray to stand trial for involuntary manslaughter .

It 's Wednesday January the 12th . One year on from the Haiti earthquake -- but a million people are still living in tents . And Michael Jackson 's doctor is officially accused over his death . But first -- there 's no let up in Australia as flood waters pour into one of its biggest cities , Brisbane . People are fleeing to evacuation centres and tens of thousands of houses are expected to be under water when flood levels peak this evening . BBC reporter Nick Bryant is there : CLIP : `` The situation is going to get worse . People are trying to sandbag their homes in the hope that they can try and block the waters . But that 's a pretty forlorn hope . I 've just been speaking to the local mayor here , he says that twenty thousand homes are either going to be totally or partially flooded . '' There 's also been severe flooding in Sri Lanka . Weeks of heavy rain have led to two-hundred thousand people losing their homes -- and the rain shows no sign of stopping . Transporting water in Port-au-Prince , the capital of Haiti Next - it 's a year since the devastating earthquake in Haiti which killed around two hundred and fifty thousand people . Twelve months on a million people are still homeless and living in makeshift camps . So far hardly any of the rubble from collapsed buildings has been cleared and poor hygiene in camps has led to diseases like cholera spreading , killing many more . Haiti still faces many problems - with much of the money promised by foreign countries not yet received on the ground . Our World News for Schools reporter spoke to Hannah Reichardt who works for the charity Save the Children and is in the capital city Port au Prince : CLIP : `` Save the Children is very concerned that all the money promised has n't yet made it to the people who need it on the ground in Haiti . What we know is that something like half to sixty per cent of the money promised by the governments has n't yet made it here . '' Before the earthquake hit , many people lived in very poor conditions - with only half of children going to school . Hannah says the kids are a priority : CLIP : `` Children in Haiti have undergone more suffering in the last year than most children in other countries will ever know in their lifetime . They 've lost close friends and family , they 've seen children like them suffer from cholera and very threatening illnesses . They 've had to undergo so much it will have a profound impact on their lives for ever . But we also know that children if they 're given the right support can be highly resilient and they can bounce back . But they need to be able to return to a normal childhood as quickly as possible . '' Next -- there 's to be a trial over the death of pop singer Michael Jackson eighteen months ago . A judge in Los Angeles has ordered his personal doctor to face charges of being accidentally involved in his death -- and not giving the singer proper care . Dr Conrad Murray says -- he 's not guilty . Finally an Italian man has astonished doctors by sneezing a bullet out through his nose after being shot in the head . Darco Sangermano was in hospital waiting for treatment when the bullet popped out of his right nostril . He 's expected to make a full recovery . And for today 's question : how fast does the average sneeze travel ? Yesterday we asked what two awards were joined to make the new FIFA world player award ? And the answer is : French Football magazine 's and the old FIFA player of the year awards . OK , that 's all from the World News for Schools team . We 're back tomorrow !

Svendsen excelled not only as composer but also as conductor ; in fact in the last 29 years of his life it was his podium activities that saw him lionised , first in Oslo , then in Copenhagen after one of the opera world 's most controversial transfer deals . The Rape Of Lucretia -- From The Aldeburgh Festival Angelika Kirschlager stars in The Rape Of Lucretia One of the highlights of this year 's Aldeburgh Festival is this concert performance of Britten 's opera The Rape Of Lucretia , with an exceptional line-up of soloists . Ronald Duncan 's libretto is based on the play Le Viol de Lucrce by Andr Obey , and Britten created the title role for Kathleen Ferrier , who gave the premire at Glyndebourne in July 1946 . Angelika Kirschlager -LRB- contralto -RRB- takes on the mantle in this performance , with Oliver Knussen conducting the Aldeburgh Festival Ensemble and a stellar cast including Ian Bostridge , Susan Gritton , Christopher Purves and Claire Booth . A classic spine-chilller by MR James , the father of the modern ghost story , set on the windswept Suffolk coast is this evening 's interval feature . In A Warning To The Curious , an amateur archaeologist from London arrives in the seaside town of Seaburgh to search for the legendary silver Crown of Anglia , which is believed to be hidden along the sandy shores of the North Sea . He uncovers the tale of the late William Ager , the guardian of the crown , which leads him to unearth the ancient relic on a remote beach . Having made his discovery , he becomes convinced he is being followed and , desperate to escape the ghostly presence , decides to return the crown to the desolate beach where it was unearthed -- with terrifying consequences . MR James spent much of his childhood on the East Anglian coast , and the fictional town of Seaburgh , in which this story is set , is based on Aldeburgh . What led to the demonisation of the working class ? Philip Dodd , in conversation with trade union lobbyist and parliamentary researcher Owen Jones , investigates how media and politicians depict the working class in tonight 's Night Waves . Plus there 's a new take on The Vorticists at Tate Modern in London . The Vorticist movement created a distinctive artistic style combining machine-age forms and energetic imagery , embracing modernity and blasting away the staid legacy of the Edwardian past . Works by Wyndham Lewis , Jacob Epstein and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska are part of a new interpretation of this pivotal movement that shone brightly but briefly just before and during the First World War .

Producer\\/Sally Avens for the BBC In the first of this two-part series , Giles Fraser , the Canon Chancellor of St Paul 's Cathedral , explores church history to find out if money really is the root of all evil . Christianity began as a peasant religion deeply suspicious of money -- `` the root of all evil '' as it 's referred to in the Bible . Charging any interest on financial loans was deemed a sin . Yet today the Church is one of the largest owners of land and stocks and shares in the country , and many City institutions are run by Christians . In this first program , Giles investigates the teachings of Jesus and the early church . He talks to church historian Diarmaid MacCulloch and visits the Franciscan Hilfield Friary in Dorset where the monks have a real commitment to poverty . Giles , very sceptical himself , challenges Brother Sam , the head of the Franciscans , and asks : why should n't Christians make money ?

Two of Michael Jackson 's brothers have criticised a planned tribute concert to the pop superstar in Cardiff as `` inappropriate '' and `` ill-timed '' . Jermaine and Randy Jackson are unhappy that it will clash with the trial of Conrad Murray , the doctor charged in relation to their brother 's death . The 8 October gig at the Millennium Stadium was announced by producers Global Live Events on Monday . But the event has won the backing of the late singer 's mother Katherine . Jackson died in June 2009 aged 50 while rehearsing for his This Is It tour . When plans for the concert were announced it was reported that Mrs Jackson , and the singer 's sister La Toya and brothers Tito , Marlon and Jackie , were in support of it . At a press conference Mrs Jackson said : `` Michael gave his entire life to the world through his love , his music and his devotion to healing the planet . '' She said she was positive that the event would `` form a worthy celebration of Michael 's life . '' Jermaine and Randy Jackson said there would come a time and place for such a tribute She revealed that `` as many members of my family that are available '' would attend the event . However following the press conference the two brothers released a statement saying that while they supported `` the spirit '' of a tribute concert , in choosing the timing of it the promoter had `` disrespected '' their opinions and wishes . `` In light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter , Global Live , '' the statement said . No acts have been announced for the concert yet but a notice on the event 's website promises `` the world 's greatest performing artists '' will appear . STATEMENT BY JERMAINE AND RANDY JACKSON `` Today 's press conference in Los Angeles announced a tribute concert to Michael to be attended and supported by the Jackson family . `` However , we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family . `` While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael 's death . `` As everyone knows , those proceedings commence September 20th , and this Michael Forever concert takes place in Cardiff , Wales , on 8 October . `` In light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter , Global Live . `` Furthermore , the decision to proceed with this concert disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms to Global Live during conversations in April when this event was presented to the majority of the family as an idea already in its advanced stages . `` There will come a time and place for an amazing and deserving tribute to Michael . But we feel that the most important tribute we can give to our brother at this time is to seek justice in his name . '' There are plans for the concert to be broadcast around the world to 30 countries in 2D and 3D . It will raise money for three charities including the Los Angeles-based Aids Project . Announcing the concert on Monday , Roger Lewis , group chief executive of the Welsh Rugby Union , which owns and operates the stadium , said the `` extra special '' concert would pay tribute to one of the world 's greatest pop icons of all time and benefit US and UK charities . He added it was `` fantastic news for music fans all over the world '' and that it would be `` a huge boost for Wales to host this spectacular one-off show . '' Global Live Events LLP has worked with a range of artists including Abba , The Beatles , Eric Clapton , Madonna , Placido Domingo , and Jackson himself . When the concert was revealed Chris Hunt , the firm 's president , said : `` We wanted to do something decent and worthy of Michael 's musical genius yet something fun and authentic that you would envision Michael attending with excitement and joy surrounded by talent that he respected and loved . '' Meanwhile , a Los Angeles judge has ruled that footage of Jackson rehearsing for a concert just days before his death will not be show in court . Prosecutors wanted to show several hours of unedited tapes filmed for the movie This Is It in an effort to prove Jackson was healthy before he died of a drug overdose in 2009 . The footage was not actually included in the movie , which was released four months after the singer 's death in 2009 . Sony Pictures , the studio behind the film , argued that showing the unseen footage in a public court may hurt its potential commercial value . Sony Pictures said it screened more than 100 hours of raw footage for the lawyers and the judge in the case . Judge Michael Pastor concluded on Monday that it would not help the defense and that `` it was a waste of my time . '' But the jury will be shown clips that were used in the film which show the star rehearsing for a series of comeback concerts in London . 12th August 2011 - 23:07 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules .

He has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter . In court in Los Angeles on Monday , Dr Murray 's lawyer Edward Chernoff said the defense 's position was that Jackson was addicted to demerol and was withdrawing from it when he died in June 2009 . But Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor ruled that Arnold Klein would not be called to testify after prosecution lawyers said the defense wanted to transfer responsibility for Jackson 's death to the dermatologist . Prosecution lawyer David Walgren also said Jackson 's autopsy found no traces of demerol . Dr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in prison if convicted The judge also barred the defense from calling five of Jackson 's other former doctors to give evidence . But he allowed them to call Allen Metzger - who had treated Jackson for two decades - and anaesthetist David Adams . Jackson had asked Mr Metzger for intravenous medicines to help him sleep two months before his death but the doctor had refused his request , defense lawyers say . And Mr Adams had given propofol to the singer on a number of occasions after dental work . A nurse who treated Jackson in 2009 will also be allowed to testify . Meanwhile , Judge Pastor has also ruled the defense can not call any witnesses to testify about Jackson 's 2005 trial and acquittal over child abuse charges , saying it would distract the jury . And he also refused a request to bring up a 2003 raid of the singer 's Neverland Ranch in California in which defense lawyers say propofol was found .

Dr Conrad Murray , 58 , denies involuntary manslaughter . If convicted , the maximum sentence is four years in prison . It was a hot midsummer day in Los Angeles on 25 June , 2009 . Hollywood was mourning the loss of the actress Farrah Fawcett , as fans and celebrities paid tribute to the TV star , who had died from cancer , aged 62 . But that day will be remembered for another , altogether unexpected death and for the extraordinary outpouring of grief it provoked . Pop star Michael Jackson , a month shy of his 51st birthday , was rushed to hospital and pronounced dead , his brother Jermaine confirming the news to stunned fans in a hastily-arranged press conference . Jackson had recently stepped back into the limelight . He was rehearsing at the Staples Centre arena in Los Angeles for This Is It , his hugely anticipated concert series , which was due to start at the O2 in London on 13 July . The night before his death , he worked until after midnight . The next day , shortly after noon , he was discovered unconscious in his bedroom by his physician Dr Conrad Murray . Dr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in prison if convicted What happened in the time between those two events remains a mystery . At a preliminary hearing , several witnesses gave detailed accounts of the frenzied activity at Jackson 's home after the singer was found to be unresponsive . The singer 's death , according to the Los Angeles County Coroner , was a homicide caused by `` acute Propofol intoxication . '' Propofol is a sedative that is normally used in hospitals to induce or maintain anaesthesia during surgical procedures . It will be up to the jury to decide whether the actions of Dr Murray , during the frantic efforts to revive the singer and in the hours before , caused his death . `` We 're finally going to get a full airing of all the facts , '' says Steven Cron , a legal analyst . `` In order to be guilty of a crime one has to be grossly negligent , not just minimally negligent , and that 's what they 're trying to prove , '' says Mr Cron . Dr Murray has strongly defended himself against the charge of involuntary manslaughter . He has insisted that nothing he did should have killed Jackson . `` I think the forensic evidence is going to be really important , '' says Mr Cron . `` There were only two people in the room and one of them is no longer with us . The other is accused . '' The jury will hear testimony from dozens of witnesses , including some of those who were first on the scene , such as Jackson 's security guards and paramedics . Experts will also be called upon to answer questions about Propofol , which will be at the heart of the case . It has been suggested by Dr Murray 's lawyers that the publicity surrounding the case could rise to the levels seen during the murder trial of the former American footballer-turned movie actor OJ Simpson in 1995 . But the judge has refused a request to have the jury sequestered , or confined to a hotel , to shield them from outside influences , as they were during the Simpson trial . Jermaine Jackson said he is prepared for a media `` circus '' Instead , Judge Michael Pastor has advised them not to `` read , listen to or watch any news report or any other commentary about this case from any source '' and to `` keep an open mind throughout '' . `` I think the Conrad Murray trial will be the trial of the year -LRB- but -RRB- it will not be the trial of the century , '' says Linda Deutsch , a special correspondent with the Associated Press , and a veteran reporter at high profile cases in California . While the defendant , Dr Murray , is not a celebrity , the trial will receive global attention because the alleged victim is Jackson , the superstar who is still worshipped by fans around the world . The proceedings , like the Simpson trial , are being televised . Media outlets from around the world set up makeshift studios near the court building . Hundreds of Jackson fans lined the street . There will be a lottery every morning to allocate seats in the public gallery . `` The fact that it is Michael Jackson puts an entirely different profile on this case Michael Jackson was a fascinating man and he still fascinates even in death , '' says Ms Deutsch . The singer 's parents and famous siblings are all expected to make an appearance at LA 's Criminal Court building , taking it in turns to fill the eight seats the family has been allocated in the courtroom . Jackson 's three children will not attend the trial . `` We 're ready , '' says his brother Jermaine Jackson , `` We 're always ready for whatever . We 've been raised and taught to take it as it comes . '' `` I 'll be strong . Very , very strong - because I know when the system works for you and I know when it works against you , '' he adds . `` I know the truth and I 'm prepared for a circus . '' Judge Pastor has estimated that the trial , up to the point that the jury starts its deliberations , will last for five weeks . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

Prosecutors said he acted with `` gross negligence '' and gave Jackson a lethal dose of the sedative propofol that caused his death in June 2009 . The defense said Jackson gave himself too much of the drug , a sleeping aid . Dr Murray , 58 , who denies the charge , could face four years in jail and the loss of his medical licence . In Tuesday 's opening statement , lead prosecutor David Walgren told the court the evidence would show `` Conrad Murray repeatedly acted with gross negligence , repeatedly denied appropriate care to his patient , Michael Jackson '' . `` That misplaced trust ... cost Michael Jackson his life . '' The jury was shown a photo of the 50-year-old singer 's pale body lying on a stretcher after he died , and heard a recording of the pop star slurring while talking about planned comeback concerts . Slurred audio of Michael Jackson taken from a message on Dr Conrad Murray 's phone Mr Walgren said the audio , aired in public for the first time , had come from a message on Dr Murray 's mobile phone . `` When people leave my show , I want them to say : ` I 've never seen nothing like this in my life , ' '' says Jackson , apparently heavily drugged , on the audio . I 've never seen nothing like this . He 's the greatest entertainer in the world . '' The prosecutor said Jackson 's difficulty in speaking on the recording showed that Dr Murray ought to have realized the star should not have taken any more propofol . Mr Walgren said that after administering what it says was the fatal dose , Dr Murray had not been attentive to Jackson 's health . The prosecutor said the doctor had left to go to the bathroom and checked his mobile phone . Peter Bowes BBC News , Los Angeles It is a familiar scene . A media circus , with TV crews , satellite trucks and reporters crammed into a narrow street opposite the downtown LA courthouse . Michael Jackson fans huddled outside , chanting : `` Justice for Michael . '' Another group , equally passionate , supported Dr Conrad Murray . I Believe in You , I Stand By You , I Love you , said one banner . The chants reached a crescendo as Michael Jackson 's family arrived to take their eight seats in the public gallery . But the spectacle was much more subdued than America 's so-called trial of the century - OJ Simpson 's - at the same court . Or , the opening day of Michael Jackson 's trial in Santa Maria , in 2005 , when he was the defendant . After the drama of the opening statements , the case will turn to scientific evidence . It could be tedious , but it will play out on television all the same . `` He -LRB- Murray -RRB- left him -LRB- Jackson -RRB- there , abandoned him to fend for himself , '' the prosecutor said . Mr Walgren said when Dr Murray found Jackson unconscious , he did not immediately call the emergency services , instead telling a bodyguard to do so 20 minutes later . Dr Murray also did not mention to paramedics or emergency room doctors that he had administered propofol , according to the prosecutor . During his lawyer 's turn to speak , Dr Murray appeared to wipe tears from his eyes . Defense attorney Ed Chernoff said it was drugs taken by Jackson himself which had proved fatal . `` He did an act without his doctor 's knowledge , without his doctor 's permission , against his orders , he did an act that caused his own death , '' Mr Chernoff said . He claimed the singer had swallowed pills of the sedative lorazepam on the morning of his death . That dosage was enough to put six people to sleep , said the defense . He also said Jackson had given himself a dose of propofol , and that it had killed him instantly . Mr Chernoff said the two drugs together had created `` a perfect storm in his body '' . Chief prosecutor David Walgren : Michael Jackson trusted his life to the medical skills of Conrad Murray Jackson `` died so rapidly , so instantly , he did n't even have time to close his eyes '' , the defense lawyer added . He also said that Dr Murray had been trying to wean Jackson off propofol , which the star used to call his `` milk '' . The prosecutor said Dr Murray had initially asked for $ 5m -LRB- # 3.2 m -RRB- to work with Jackson for a year , though accepted a lower rate of $ 150,000 per month . But his contract to become the star 's personal physician was never signed , and Dr Murray was never paid . Jackson choreographer Kenny Ortega was the first prosecution witness to take the stand . He told the court of Jackson 's excitement about his series of comeback concerts . Mr Ortega also told the court that days before Jackson 's death , he expressed `` deep concern '' in an email to Jackson 's concert promoter about the state of Jackson 's health . Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said Michael Jackson '' did an act that caused his own death '' The email was written after a period of about a week when Jackson repeatedly failed to appear at rehearsals . But in the last day or two before Jackson 's death Mr Ortega said the star seemed `` full of energy , full of desire to work ... It was a different Michael . '' Footage of the star 's rehearsals became part of a documentary , This Is It , directed by Mr Ortega . Paul Gongaware , co-chief executive of concert promoter AEG , followed Mr Ortega to the stand as the second prosecution witness . He told the court about how he employed Dr Murray as Jackson 's personal physician . A number of witnesses , including security guards , paramedics and emergency room doctors , are yet to be called . Propofol is usually administered intravenously , often during surgery . Medical experts are expected to testify about the sedative 's effects , as well as how a trace of the drug was found in Jackson 's stomach .

Dr Murray is accused of causing the 50-year-old 's death on 25 June 2009 . He denies charges of involuntary manslaughter . The prosecution team claims Conrad Murray is an incompetent physician who used an anesthetic called Propofol without the proper safeguards . The defense says Jackson caused his own death by taking a drug overdose , including Propofol , after Murray left his bedroom on the day of his death . Find out what drugs were found in Michael Jackson 's body . Propofol is a fast-acting hospital sedative , administered intravenously and used before anaesthetics . It was first used widely in the late 1980s . The drug , which Conrad Murray gave to the singer to help him sleep , is made by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and is also sold under the brand name Diprivan . The prosecution team says Murray used large quantities of Propofol Experts say Propofol is extremely powerful and not meant for use outside hospitals and clinics . Propofol was referred to by Michael Jackson as his `` milk '' because of the milk-like appearance . The drug is administered either by intravenous drip or by being injected ahead of an anesthetic , or to keep a patient anesthetized during an operation . It is a preferred sedative in operating theaters because it is well tolerated and allows patients to recover quicker . It 's commonly used in outpatient surgery or as a sedative for certain examinations . Propofol is also used as a painkiller or anti-anxiety drug in post-operative care . Conrad Murray told police in 2009 that he gave Michael Jackson other drugs known as benzodiazepines , which are also used as sleep aids . But when they did not work , he claims Jackson demanded Propofol . Murray 's defense lawyer Ed Chernoff claimed the singer swallowed several pills of Lorazepam on the morning of his death , enough to put six people to sleep . It is widely used as a sedative and muscle relaxant . Also known as Ativan and Temesta , the drug is used short-term for insomnia , anxiety , seizures and for sedating aggressive patients . Midazolam is used in a similar way to Lorazepam . It is widely used as a sedative and to treat seizures . Also know as Dormicum , Hypnovel and Versed , the drug is also used short-term to treat severe insomnia and anxiety . Jackson was given four milligrams of the drug on the morning of his death . Diazepam is better known as Valium . It 's used as a relaxant for patients suffering from insomnia and anxiety as well as seizures . Michael Jackson was given a 10 milligram tablet of Diazepam at 1.30 am on the morning of his death because he could n't sleep . Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and is sometimes used to treat skin inflammations . It is used by dentists to anaesthetise patients ' gums . Michael Jackson had a dose of Propofol diluted with Lidocaine at 10.40 am on the day of his death . It is primarily used as an appetite suppressant and stimulant .

Speaking of the singer , Fearne Cotton said : `` I was always a massive fan of Michael Jackson himself . `` Without him there 's a whole generation of performers and entertainers who might never have got their break in music . `` His contribution was crucial and his premature death a complete tragedy . '' The concert was initially announced by the star 's mother Katherine .

'' Last month the organiser of the Michael Jackson tribute concert Chris Hunt defended the event saying that he has the `` overwhelming majority '' of the Jackson family behind him . He told Newsbeat the event `` reminds people just how fantastic Michael Jackson was '' , and rejected the idea that the concert will be `` inappropriate '' . But Jermaine Jackson said : `` We 're all focused on getting justice for Michael , the best tribute we can do for him is getting justice and making sure we get justice as a family as to what happened .

The offer was available on a first-come-first-served basis . A council spokesman said he did not know how many free tickets were available but it was not believed to be a large amount and free tickets had not been offered to all council staff .

In the interview with police , Dr Murray says that on the night of 25 June 2009 , he injected Jackson with several sedatives , but the pop star remained wide awake . `` He 's not able to sleep naturally , '' he told detectives early in the interview . Jackson complained that he needed to sleep , as he had rehearsals for his comeback tour early the next morning . Dr Murray described giving Jackson lorazepam and another drug , Versed . `` And four o'clock came and four o'clock went and he was still awake , '' Dr Murray said in the recording , describing the 10-hour battle to get the star to fall asleep . Eventually , he said Jackson asked for his `` milk '' - which was his word for propofol . `` He said : ` Please , please give me some milk so I can sleep ' , '' Dr Murray told police . Jackson fell asleep after being given the injection . `` I watched him for a long enough period that I felt comfortable , '' Dr Murray said . He said that eventually he had to the leave the room for two minutes , and when he returned he found that Jackson had stopped breathing . He said he immediately tried to revive the singer by compressing his chest , and then called Jackson 's personal assistant to get help in the frantic resuscitation attempt . A security guard called the emergency services and the singer was eventually taken to hospital , where he was pronounced dead . During the two-hour recording , Dr Murray said he wished Jackson no harm , and in fact had been attempting to wean the singer off propofol in his final days . He acknowledged that he had given the singer propofol every day for the past two months . `` He was my friend . He opened up to me in different ways . I wanted to help him ... I cared for him . I had no intention of hurting him . I did not want him to fail . '' But he added : `` I realized Michael Jackson had a dependency and I was trying to wean him off it .

Jackson fans line up against the courtroom wall at 07:30 every morning in the hope of winning a draw for one of the few seats in the public gallery . Like millions of others across America and the world they could watch it on the internet or on TV , but there is obviously something more to be gained from being there in person , sitting just a few feet from the lawyers , the family and the accused . I joined the draw two days in a row - second-time lucky - to get a feel for the courtroom and to immerse myself in a trial that has been creating a buzz across America . It was an interesting day to sit in on the trial . It was a day which began with what the TV pundits called a `` cornerstone of the defense '' being pulled away , and went on to hear some damning accusations of `` gross negligence '' against the man whom Michael Jackson trusted as his doctor . Before proceedings even began , before the 16 men and women of the jury had been buzzed into their seats , the defense had conceded Michael Jackson could not have drunk the drug which killed him . Propofol is what it the trial all about . It is is an extremely strong sedative and Michael Jackson was having his doctor use it to help him get to sleep . It was a combination of that and a number of other sedatives which caused his death - and as the man prescribing the pills , injections and intravenous drugs , Conrad Murray stands accused of causing his death by involuntary manslaughter . One key line of defense is that Michael Jackson took the drugs himself , when his doctor was not looking . A presumption made by the countless commentators , TV experts , ex-prosecutors and journalists was that Michael Jackson drank the drug . But research by both the prosecution and the defense proved it was only effective if injected straight into the blood . And so a line of questioning defense lawyers may have used , and indeed hinted they would use , was dropped - but not the theory of self-medication altogether . Jackson could have injected himself , or taken other pills , but that is for another day of evidence or for when the defense case begins . But this day was all about independent medical experts and their professional opinion of Dr Murray . They were not impressed . For much of the day cardiologist Dr Alon Steinberg was in the stand , describing how he had reviewed Dr Murray 's own account of what happened the night Michael Jackson died , as told to a detective . He outlined six separate instances of what he called `` gross negligence . '' `` Propofol should never be given as a sleeping drug , '' was his premise , explaining it was a strong sedative used as an anesthetic in surgical operations and its use in this way was negligent and unethical . Once given the drug , Michael Jackson should have been monitored properly , all the time , with heart and blood pressure monitors , back-up drugs and equipment in case anything went wrong . And perhaps most damning of all , he said the way Conrad Murray reacted when Jackson stopped breathing was `` responsible for the singer 's death '' . By not immediately calling the emergency services , taking the wrong action in those vital few minutes and not having prepared for an emergency , he had made `` a direct contribution to Michael Jackson 's death '' , Dr Steinberg told the court . The second witness , Professor Nader Kamangar , was equally critical of the use of such a powerful sedative which he said required proper training and was usually given in a hospital or clinical environment , not in someone 's home . He also reviewed Conrad Murray 's account of what happened , and as a sleep medicine expert stressed propofol should not be used for insomnia . The two independent witnesses helped build up a strong picture of a poor doctor who did not follow basic procedure and was negligent . It is a picture the defense will be keen to undermine in the cross-examination of Prof Kamangar , with the prosecution continuing to build its case against Conrad Murray as the trial approaches its half-way mark . Meanwhile the Jackson fans will keep on arriving for the daily lottery , to secure one of those precious seats in the courtroom . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

The expert called Dr Murray `` clueless '' about the drug that contributed to the 50-year-old singer 's June 2009 death . Dr Murray denies involuntary manslaughter of the star .

He said Dr Murray 's lack of record keeping had been a denial of Jackson 's rights . Dr Shafer also criticised Dr Murray for talking on the phone in the hours before Jackson 's death . The anaesthesiology expert said doctors should never multi-task while monitoring a sedated patient . `` A patient who is about to die does not look all that different from a patient who is OK , '' he said .

Dr Waldman told jurors that was a `` large dose '' for a dermatology procedure in an office . On cross-examination , however , prosecutor David Walgren asked Dr Waldman about legal obligations for doctors , including a requirement to keep accurate and detailed records . Dr Murray told police he had kept no records on his treatment of Jackson . Dr Paul White said after reading documents regarding the case he was `` perplexed '' . `` I would not have expected Michael Jackson to have died , '' if the dose Dr Murray said he had given Jackson was correct .

Months later , the 58-year-old was charged with Jackson 's death and became a hate figure to the singer 's legions of fans around the world . Raised by his grandparents in Grenada in poverty , Dr Murray worked his way up to become a successful cardiologist in the US . A series of financial and personal problems seemed to be ending after a chance meeting in Las Vegas with Michael Jackson led to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . Dr Murray was hired at Jackson 's request to be the star 's personal physician ahead of his 50-date series of London concerts , This Is It . Raised by his maternal grandparents , Dr Murray proved a hard-working student , eventually following his absent father , also a doctor , to the US - where he enrolled at Texas Southern University . He graduated three years later with a degree in pre-medicine and biological sciences . He continued his medical studies in Nashville , Tennessee , before completing his training in California and the University of Arizona , where he studied cardiology . In 2000 , he opened his own practice in Las Vegas , expanding with a second clinic in Houston in 2006 . Like his father , he took pride serving both ends of the community , and provided medical care to deprived areas . However , Dr Murray 's apparent success was blighted by outstanding debts and tax demands . Reports suggest he filed for bankruptcy in 2002 while living in California . The doctor 's financial problems stemmed by providing medical care for the poor , his lawyers have said . He had not paid the mortgage on his home in months when Jackson offered him the job as his personal physician . Other unpaid bills and debts loomed . Dr Murray met Michael Jackson when the singer 's daughter , Paris , was sick during a family trip to Las Vegas in 2006 . According to Dr Murray 's spokeswoman , someone within Jackson 's group knew the doctor and called Dr Murray to treat her . They remained friendly and Jackson hired the physician in May 2009 . He was to be paid $ 150,000 -LRB- # 96,000 -RRB- a month . `` As a company , we would have preferred not having a physician on staff full-time because it would have been cheaper ... but Michael was insistent that he be hired , '' promoter AEG 's Randy Phillips told the Associated Press . `` Michael said he had a rapport with him . '' Dr Murray 's lawyer , Edward Chernoff , said the case had put his client in fear of his life and he had to be accompanied `` 24\\/7 with a bodyguard '' . The prosecution called Dr Murray 's girlfriends to testify `` He ca n't operate his practice , '' said the attorney . `` He ca n't go to work because he is harassed no matter where he goes . '' According to public records cited by the LA Times , Dr Murray had two children with his wife , but also fathered several children with different women . Those children included the now young toddler of Nicole Alvarez , an actress who met Dr Murray in 2005 . Several of Dr Murray 's recent girlfriends have also testified at his trial , as well as former patients .

Dr Conrad Murray was at Jackson 's home when the pop star died , sloppily administering medicine that should only have been administered in a hospital . There are , I suspect , few jurors in the world who would have gone out of their way to search for a more complex narrative in order to spare the defendant a few years or months in jail . Throughout the trial , Murray 's lawyers tried gingerly to blame Jackson himself for his own death , a tactic which reflected both the desperation of the defense case and the nature of California 's involuntary manslaughter statute . Team Murray hoped that if jurors blamed the singer himself for an overdose , they might mete out a measure of sympathy for a doctor who , like so many other doctors who treat celebrities , thought he had his patient under control when he did not . California law , however , makes this a very difficult proposition . It is not enough to demonstrate , as Murray 's lawyers did , that the victim of the crime contributed to his own death . Even if Jackson injected himself with the drug that ultimately killed him , prosecutors told jurors in closing arguments , Murray should have foreseen that this would occur because he knew that Jackson liked to `` push '' his own drugs . Given this standard , what chance did Murray ever really have ? The rest of world envisioned a tragic end for Jackson ... After covering his 2005 molestation trial I certainly did . Why did n't Murray ? '' The prosecution 's theory resonated with the jury because it was founded on the language of the statute as announced during jury instructions . But when you stop and think about it , it is truly an extraordinary thing . California is about to send a man to prison - for a while anyway - even though many reasonable people would agree that Jackson played a prominent role in his own death . The law says that Murray should have known better , even if Jackson did not ; that the doctor had a responsibility to his patient even if his patient were bent on pushing past medically acceptable standards . You could say , as Murray 's lawyers implied , that the good doctor was in the wrong place at the wrong time . They acknowledged , as they had to , that their client 's professional performance during the fatal episode was not what any of us would want from our own bedside doctors . But the defense lawyers tried to take the mens rea element , the criminal element , out of the case . Murray may have been a quack , they argued , but he had absolutely no bad intent toward the richest patient he or any private doctor was ever likely to have . Or you could say , as prosecutors did , that any good doctor would not have come anywhere near the circus that was Jackson 's relationship with prescription drugs . How long Murray will spend behind bars is up to Judge Michael Pastor Murray did not officially represent the King of Pop for long . But like everyone else in the world he surely knew that he was taking on a patient with a reputation for using drugs to try to tune out the demons which afflicted him . The rest of world envisioned a tragic end for Jackson along these lines . After covering his 2005 molestation trial I certainly did . Why did n't Murray ? The just-completed trial was a good one , in which the lawyers ably represented their causes and the trial judge , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor , did a laudable job keeping control of a celebrity case . On 29 November , during sentencing , I believe that Judge Pastor will show more mercy to Murray than did his jurors . Murray faces anywhere from probation to four years , but it is clear from the fact that he is now in jail - the judge denied bail pending sentencing - that Judge Pastor is going to give him some prison time . My bet is that the sentence will be towards the lower side . California 's prisons are notoriously overcrowded . In fact , the state has been forced by the United States Supreme Court to reduce the prison population to more manageable levels . Michael Jackson 's billion or so fans may argue that Conrad Murray deserves the hardest time possible . But the truth of the matter is that the eternal law of economics is on Murray 's side . He made terrible errors in judgment , and he 's paying the price . And none of that will ever bring back Michael Jackson or tell us what next might have happened had he lived through that day . 8th November 2011 - 17:42 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . 8th November 2011 - 17:40 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . 9th November 2011 - 8:40 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . 9th November 2011 - 8:26 This to me seems like the infectious American legal and suing culture .

With less than three weeks to go before the start of a series of comeback concerts at London 's O2 arena even he , the ultimate perfectionist , had to admit things were looking good . After viewing the video clips that would accompany such classic hits as Billie Jean and She 's Out of My Life , Jackson had led the company in their first dress rehearsal of Thriller . When it was over he hugged the dancers and thanked the crew . Several of those who were present that night at the Los Angeles Staples Center said he was grinning from ear to ear . It was a little after one o'clock in the morning by the time Jackson returned to the French chateau-style mansion he had been renting on the outskirts of Beverly Hills . Waiting for him in his bedroom on the first floor was Conrad Murray . Tall and softly-spoken , Dr Murray had grown up on the Caribbean island of Grenada and like his father , who was also a doctor , moved to America in the hope of making a better life for himself . He had been introduced to Michael Jackson three years previously by a patient who had worked for Jackson . On the night in question Dr Murray had served as the singer 's personal physician for barely two months . Nevertheless , he was familiar with the routine . Once Michael Jackson had emerged from the shower Dr Murray applied cream to his back to treat a pigmentation disorder known as vitiligo and the two men then settled into the more challenging aspect of their nightly ritual : getting Jackson to sleep . Experience had taught Dr Murray that this could be a prolonged routine . On this occasion it was to last until well after sunrise . Fast forward to a little after noon on the same day and the calm of the eight-bedroom mansion was shattered by the sound of shouting from Jackson 's bedroom - followed a few minutes later by the sound of people racing up the stairs . Paramedics responding to a call about a 50-year-old man suffering cardiac arrest found Michael Jackson sprawled across the floor in his pyjamas with a surgical cap on his head . Oxygen tanks littered the doorway ; a child-sized porcelain doll lay on the bed . The heating was on - despite the fact that this was the middle of summer - and sweat was pouring down Dr Murray 's face as he attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . Dr Murray has admitted to administering propofol to Jackson in his bedroom But one look at Jackson 's limp , lifeless body told the paramedics there was nothing they could do . His pupils were already dilated and his skin cold to the touch . The faux French chateau , which Michael Jackson had been renting in LA - for a reported $ 100,000 -LRB- # 62,000 -RRB- a month - had seen some illustrious neighbors . Barbra Streisand , Frank Sinatra , Mick Jagger and Cher had all called the same street home . But the fact that Jackson 's all-time idol Elvis Presley had once lived just around the corner may ultimately have been what persuaded him to move there . Minutes after the news broke of Jackson 's death that same street - a stone 's throw from Sunset Boulevard - was swarming with reporters . News helicopters hovered overhead , satellite trucks jammed the side streets . It had been more than four years since I - or any other journalist present that day - had last seen Jackson . That was in the town of Santa Maria , in the heart of California wine country , following his acquittal on charges of child sex abuse in 2005 . Covering that trial every day for nearly four months I was struck by the effect the proceedings seemed to have on Jackson 's wellbeing . We all remember the pictures of him shuffling into court in his pyjamas but there were times when he almost seemed to be withering away in front of our very eyes as details of his unorthodox lifestyle were dished up for the world to see . Jackson considered the charges against him outrageous and the documentary which prompted them a `` betrayal '' . Although the verdict went in his favor , there was little doubt in my mind that he left Santa Maria a broken man . Unsurprisingly perhaps , friends say it was around the time of that court case that Jackson started finding it increasingly difficult to get to sleep . He had suffered from a variety of ailments over the years but none compared to the torment he endured once the lights went out . `` I once said Michael would have paid a $ 1m for a good night 's sleep and though I was being somewhat facetious , in many ways it was true , '' Jackson 's biographer J Randy Taraborrelli told the BBC . Fans of Jackson have waited outside the Los Angeles courthouse throughout the six-week long trial `` When stressed out he could n't sleep . Michael told me once that when he went to bed he could n't stop the creative process . `` He was always creating , imagining , wondering how things would work out and what he could do to make them better . ' I ca n't turn it off ' was how he put it to me . ' I wish I could . But I ca n't ' . '' Meaning that the more he needed it , the more elusive sleep became . Hence the decision to go `` doctor shopping '' in a quest to find someone who would prescribe the one substance he knew could save him from sleeplessness . Dr Conrad Murray told detectives he first became aware of propofol after he allowed another doctor to treat Jackson at his surgery in Las Vegas . Jackson slept soundly and when he awoke the two men discussed the possibility of Murray accompanying Michael Jackson to London . Dr Murray , who throughout that interview referred to Jackson as a `` friend '' , initially asked for $ 5m . When the tour promoters , who were footing the bill on the Jackson 's behalf , baulked at that price he agreed to lower it to $ 150,000 a month . Those who knew Michael Jackson well all seem to agree on one thing . Gifted though he was as an entertainer - and , at times , as a businessman - as a judge of character his skills frequently left something to be desired . Jackson 's sister La Toya referred to the `` shadowy entourage '' of handlers who frequently attached themselves to him like barnacles to a ship . Michael Jackson 's previous Los Angeles home Neverland Over the years there was a virtual `` revolving door '' of assistants and advisors , many of whom seemed to bring a lot less to the table than they took from it . `` Michael put his trust in a lot of people over the years , '' said Mr Taraborrelli . `` He always gave people the benefit of the doubt . He would wait until a person proved him wrong before that person would be ousted from his life . -LRB- In some cases -RRB- he waited too long . '' The tragedy of this tale is that it could all have ended so very differently . Once the concerts at London 's O2 arena had come to an end Michael Jackson was planning to take the show on a worldwide tour and use the proceeds to build a hospital for disadvantaged children , headed - you 've guessed it - by Dr Conrad Murray . He also intended to spend more time with his three children - Paris , Prince and Prince Michael II , known as Blanket - whom he was raising alone . The mansion he once occupied may also have changed hands effortlessly had he survived . Yet with Neverland long-since closed and Jackson 's grave off-limits to anyone other than family and friends , it has become - by default - a focal point for fans desperate for a link to their hero , no matter how macabre that link may be . Which almost certainly was not what the owner - the head of the Ed Hardy fashion chain - had in mind when he bought the place . He has made two attempts to sell it since Michael Jackson died but has yet to attract a buyer . The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

During the trial they were shown images of the singer lying dead in a hospital and rehearsing the day before his death . The prosecution team claimed Conrad Murray was an incompetent physician who used an anesthetic called Propofol without the proper safeguards . The defense said Jackson caused his own death by taking a drug overdose , including Propofol , after Murray left his bedroom on the day of his death . Find out what drugs were found in Michael Jackson 's body . Propofol is a fast-acting hospital sedative , administered intravenously and used before anaesthetics . It was first used widely in the late 1980s . The drug , which Conrad Murray gave to the singer to help him sleep , is made by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and is also sold under the brand name Diprivan . The prosecution team said Murray used large quantities of Propofol Experts say Propofol is extremely powerful and not meant for use outside hospitals and clinics . Propofol was referred to by Michael Jackson as his `` milk '' because of the milk-like appearance . The drug is administered either by intravenous drip or by being injected ahead of an anesthetic , or to keep a patient anesthetized during an operation . It is a preferred sedative in operating theaters because it is well tolerated and allows patients to recover quicker . It 's commonly used in outpatient surgery or as a sedative for certain examinations . Propofol is also used as a painkiller or anti-anxiety drug in post-operative care . Conrad Murray told police in 2009 that he gave Michael Jackson other drugs known as benzodiazepines , which are also used as sleep aids . But when they did not work , he claimed Jackson demanded Propofol . Murray 's defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said the singer swallowed several pills of Lorazepam on the morning of his death , enough to put six people to sleep . It is widely used as a sedative and muscle relaxant . Also known as Ativan and Temesta , the drug is used short-term for insomnia , anxiety , seizures and for sedating aggressive patients . Midazolam is used in a similar way to Lorazepam . It is widely used as a sedative and to treat seizures . Also know as Dormicum , Hypnovel and Versed , the drug is also used short-term to treat severe insomnia and anxiety . Jackson was given four milligrams of the drug on the morning of his death . Diazepam is better known as Valium . It 's used as a relaxant for patients suffering from insomnia and anxiety as well as seizures . Michael Jackson was given a 10 milligram tablet of Diazepam at 1.30 am on the morning of his death because he could n't sleep . Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and is sometimes used to treat skin inflammations . It is used by dentists to anaesthetise patients ' gums . Michael Jackson had a dose of Propofol diluted with Lidocaine at 10.40 am on the day of his death . It is primarily used as an appetite suppressant and stimulant .

Speaking to Channel 4 , he maintained he had been trying to wean Jackson off propofol before the star 's death . But Dr Murray admitted it had been `` really stupid '' and `` careless '' not to keep notes of his treatment . `` Was this a mistake ? Absolutely , '' he said . `` But the absence of notes was not responsible for his death . '' Dr Murray did not give evidence during his six-week trial , which ended on Monday when a jury ruled he had given Jackson a fatal overdose of propofol . He spoke to journalist Steve Hewlett eight days before the verdict as part of a documentary called The Man Who Killed Michael Jackson . The pop star 's family have complained about the program , which is due to be screened in the US next week . under the title Michael Jackson and the Doctor : A Fatal Friendship . The executors of the pop star 's estate said Murray was getting a primetime platform to smear Jackson 's reputation without fear of cross-examination , and demanded that the screening be canceled . `` Like so many of Michael 's fans , the estate is ... disgusted by MSNBC 's irresponsible and inexplicable decision to air a Conrad Murray ` documentary ' , '' it said . Asked about Jackson 's use of propofol , Dr Murray said : `` I did not recommend it . I would never have recommended propofol to Mr Jackson '' . `` He needed to get rid of it and resume a more normal state of sleep . '' Using an analogy to explain his actions , he told Mr Hewlett : `` If I came to your house and you were a friend of mine and unexpectedly I saw you with a gun in your hand , I can do one of two things and maybe succeed . `` I can tell you stop it and you might listen to me , or I might take hours to get you to hand over that gun . So I would say , basically , it took me a while to take away from Michael something I thought he should not use . '' Describing the night when Jackson died , Dr Murray accounted for his actions in the one hour and 40 minutes between administering propofol and the emergency services being called . He said he had sat with Jackson , checking his vital signs until he believed the effects of the sedative had worn off , before moving to an adjacent room at 11:20 am . `` If you say : ` Dr Murray , that was really stupid , you should have had a look , ' then I agree , '' he said . Dr Murray added that he had not informed police or the ambulance crew that Jackson had taken the drug because `` they never asked me '' and `` I did not think it was important '' . The prosecution said Murray had caused Jackson 's death through negligence His comments echoed a similar interview given to the US breakfast television show Today earlier this week . `` I think propofol is not recommended to be given in the home setting , '' Dr Murray said during the interview . `` But it is not contraindicated . '' In court , the defense argued that Jackson was a drug addict who caused his own death by giving himself an extra dose of propofol while the cardiologist was out of the room at the star 's rented Los Angeles mansion . Murray told Today 's Savannah Guthrie he had not been distracted by phone calls , emails and text messages . `` When I looked at a man who was all night deprived of sleep , who was desperate for sleep and finally is getting some sleep , am I gonna sit over him , sit around him , tug on his feet , do anything unusual to wake him up ? No , '' Murray said . Asked if he was right to leave Jackson alone , he replied : `` Had I known what I know today in retrospect , that Mr Jackson was an addict - and he had shared that information with me - addicts may behave in a way that is unreasonable and you may consider it .

While the prosecution successfully argued for the maximum term , Murray 's lawyers asked that he be kept on probation , saying he is serving `` a lifetime sentence of self-punishment '' . Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said he would already be punished for life by being known as `` the man who killed Michael Jackson '' . In addition , Murray could still lose his licence to practice medicine .

But the issue that caused the most disagreement between the two key members of Dr Conrad Murray 's legal team was the question of whether the defendant himself should testify on his own behalf . Murray 's pugnacious Texas-based lead counsel , Ed Chernoff , was adamant Murray should not take the stand . He feared the case raised so many unanswered questions it would be `` open season '' for the prosecution when the time came to cross-examine the physician . His flaxen-haired co-counsel Michael Flanagan disagreed . As the trial progressed and the evidence against Murray mounted , Mr Flanagan became convinced his client 's only chance of acquittal lay in giving his own version of events . As he told the magazine Texas Lawyer shortly after Murray was convicted : `` The elephant in the room was the need for the doctor to explain what he did . '' Anything over a couple of dollars he is simply not going to have the ability to pay '' End Quote Michael Flanagan Conrad Murray 's co-counsel It was something Murray himself had clearly been weighing up right until the very last minute . As the defense moved to rest its case . Judge Michael Pastor reminded the doctor of his right to take the stand and asked him directly whether he wished to reconsider . Murray looked at Mr Flanagan and Mr Chernoff in turn and then paused for what seemed like an eternity before replying , `` no '' . That he chose to break his silence in a documentary broadcast on the American network MSNBC just a few days after being found guilty clearly irritated Judge Pastor . But it was the program 's contents that left the judge almost incandescent . Far from appearing remorseful about what had happened to Michael Jackson , Murray almost seemed to regard himself as the victim , declaring defiantly : `` I do n't feel guilty , because I did n't do anything wrong . '' Murray passed up a final chance to address the court minutes before his sentencing . The judge said the documentary interview was ultimately what persuaded him against granting the accused probation , thereby paving the way to a maximum sentence of four years in prison . Jackson 's family is pushing for the astonishing sum of more than $ 100m Mr Flanagan said afterwards that while the judge would have wanted to hear from Murray it was probably too late by then to affect the outcome . `` The die was cast a long time ago , '' said the lawyer , ruefully . It seems unlikely that either Mr Flanagan or Mr Chernoff will be back in court for a hearing at the end of January to determine how much Murray will have to pay by way of restitution to Michael Jackson 's estate . The tension between Mr Flanagan and Mr Chernoff - which even surfaced in that controversial documentary - is one reason they are both reported to be keen to put the Conrad Murray case behind them . Jackson 's family is pushing for the astonishing sum of more than $ 100m -LRB- # 64m -RRB- . They say that is what he stood to make from the This Is It concerts at London 's O2 arena . Jackson had been rehearsing for a series of concerts in London But the fact of the matter is this : Conrad Murray was heavily in debt when he went to work for Michael Jackson , and since Jackson died before he could repay those debts Mr Flanagan believes the family will be lucky to see much of it . `` Anything over a couple of dollars he is simply not going to have the ability to pay , '' he said . And then there is the question of the lawyer 's own remuneration . The Texas Lawyer article revealed that it had `` not been equal to the task '' and quoted Ed Chernoff as saying : `` If Dr Murray had paid me a quarter-of-a-million dollars it -LRB- would have been -RRB- entirely too little considering the amount of work that was involved and the collateral issues that were attached . '' The only upside being that - given the high profile nature of the case - future generations of law students may well end up mulling their arguments and discussing their testimony and wondering , perhaps , whether things might have been different had Murray taken the stand .
