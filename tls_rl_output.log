ret ==  Greenpeace has accused BP of slashing investment in clean energy A balcony protest at BP 's London headquarters over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has ended with no arrests . Two Greenpeace campaigners who unfurled a flag showing the company 's logo smudged in oil and the words `` British Polluters '' came down unassisted . Six others held banners as they greeted staff at a side entrance on the ground . Oil has been spewing into the Gulf since the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April , which killed 11 workers . A Greenpeace spokesman said the protesters chose to come down because they had `` made their point '' 
ret ==  Gulf spill : US to keep boot on BP 's neck - Salazar BP says it shares public frustration at its inability to plug the leaking well The US government has toughened its rhetoric towards BP as frustration builds about the company 's inability to plug a leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar pledged to `` keep our boot on their neck until the job gets done '' . BP Plc would be accountable , `` civilly and in whatever way is necessary '' , he said on a tour of the Gulf . Earlier on Monday , BP pledged $ 500m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- to study the spill 's impact on the environment . The company says it will be Wednesday before it tries a so-called `` top kill '' bid to plug the leak - firing heavy mud and cement down into the blown out well 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- below the surface of the Gulf 
ret ==  Obama pledges to triple oil response manpower in Gulf President Barack Obama : `` It 's an assault on the shores and our people '' US President Barack Obama has ordered a tripling of manpower in coastal areas where oil has washed ashore or threatens to within 24 hours . Speaking on a tour of oil-hit areas , Mr Obama said the US would `` do whatever it takes '' to help those affected . The oil company BP says operations to seal the hole in the damaged well are continuing . BP chief executive Tony Hayward said the outcome would not be clear for another 48 hours . He said the new `` top kill '' effort - untested before at this depth of 5,000 ft -LRB- 1
ret ==  Oil firm BP has lowered a cap on to a leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , in the hope of piping some of the oil to ships on the surface . Video footage showed the cap lowered into place against pressure from escaping oil and gas . BP said some oil had started flowing up the pipe attached to the cap , but it could take the rest of the day to determine how much . The US Coast Guard said the cap would only be a temporary , partial fix . Live underwater video footage from the site on Friday showed quantities of oil still escaping into the sea 
ret ==  BP 's Doug Suttles explains how the cap is meant to operate A new cap placed over a ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has begun to funnel oil to the surface . US Coast Guard chief Adm Thad Allen said rough estimates showed that 1,000 barrels a day were being captured . This is only a small part of the 12,000-19 ,000 barrels a day believed to be leaking and BP says it could take 48 hours to know if the system is working . Meanwhile , President Obama arrived in Louisiana for his third visit to the region since the crisis began . The visit to the Gulf area comes as beaches in the key tourist area of north-west Florida saw their first major signs of oil 
ret ==  Mr Obama has made three visits to Louisiana since the spill US President Barack Obama has pledged to use `` every resource '' available to clean shores and help those affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . In his weekly address , Mr Obama said that BP appeared to be `` making progress '' in containing the leak after placing a cap over the well . But the company 's latest effort , even if successful , will only stop some of the leak . Mr Obama has faced mounting criticism for his handling of the crisis . Correspondents say that , as the political fall-out has increased , the president 's tone has become stronger , saying earlier in the week that he was `` furious '' with how the issue has been managed 
ret ==  BP cap captures ' 10,000 barrels ' a day in US Gulf Tony Hayward , chief executive of BP , on the oil leak and stakeholder dividends A containment cap on a ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico is now funnelling off 10,000 barrels of oil a day , BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward says . The amount has risen since Saturday , and implies more than half the estimated 12,000 to 19,000 barrels leaking each day is now being captured . The spill has been described as the biggest environmental disaster in US history . Mr Hayward told the BBC that BP would restore the Gulf to its original state . Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show , Mr Hayward said : `` As we speak , the containment cap is producing around 10,000 barrels of oil a day to the surface 
ret ==  Shares in BP fell a further 5 % on Tuesday after US President Barack Obama launched his most strident attack yet on the oil giant . The company - in which most of the UK 's pension funds invest - has seen its shares tumble almost 40 % since April 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . President Obama said earlier he would have fired BP chief executive Tony Hayward over remarks he made . Some analysts have called for the BP boss to announce plans to step down . In an interview with NBC , Mr Obama was asked about comments Mr Hayward made in the wake of the disaster , which killed 11 people , such as `` I want my life back '' and the Gulf is `` a big ocean '' 
ret ==  US Adm Thad Allen says oil clean-up ` will take years ' Coast Guard chief Admiral Thad Allen warns oil will not be fully contained for months The US Coast Guard chief says cleaning up marshlands affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill will take years . Adm Thad Allen said oil giant BP needed to do better at getting money to people and businesses affected by the spill . Some 11,000 barrels of oil were being trapped by a containment cap , he said . President Barack Obama defended his response to the spill , using some of his toughest language yet . He said he had frequently consulted with experts in order to learn `` whose ass to kick '' 
ret ==  US President Barack Obama has strongly criticised BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward over the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . In an interview with NBC , Mr Obama was asked about comments Mr Hayward made in the wake of the disaster , such as `` I want my life back '' and the Gulf is `` a big ocean '' . Mr Obama said : `` He would n't be working for me after any of those statements . '' He said he had visited the Louisiana coast `` so I know whose ass to kick '' . The interview on NBC 's Today show is to be broadcast later on Tuesday 
ret ==  Images of oil-covered birds are fuelling public anger in the US The US government has given BP 72 hours to present its latest plans to clean up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . BP says its containment effort is going well , but there are signs of mistrust between the company and the government . The US justice department is mulling legal action to make sure BP has enough funds to cover the damage and compensate those affected by the slick . That could mean shareholders are not paid dividends , which would infuriate investors and hit pension funds . Amid growing public anger in the US , President Barack Obama will make his fourth visit to the region on Monday 
ret ==  BP accused of ` lack of integrity ' by US House speaker BP is working to contain the spill having failed to plug the leak US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accused BP of a `` lack of integrity '' when making its case for deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . US President Barack Obama has met relatives of the 11 workers killed in the explosion on the BP-leased oil platform in the Gulf . BP shares in the UK have fallen to their lowest level since 1997 amid fears of huge US penalties . The US attorney general said America would `` not pay a dime '' for cleaning up . BP would be held responsible for all damages , Eric Holder said 
ret ==  This is Mr Obama 's fourth visit to the oil-affected area US President Barack Obama has said the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico will have the same impact on the US psyche as 9\/11 . The disaster will `` shape how we think about the environment ... for years to come '' , he told US website Politico 
ret ==  President Barack Obama said his government was responding to the largest environmental disaster in US history US President Barack Obama has called on his party and supporters to back a `` new future '' of clean energy . Visiting areas affected by the BP oil spill , he said the full resources of government were being used , with 17,500 National Guard soldiers available . BP 's US head , Lamar McKay , is to return to Congress shortly for further questioning . Oil has been spewing into the Gulf of Mexico since a drilling rig it leased exploded and sank in April . The company has put the cost of the clean-up to date at $ 1
ret ==  Edward Markey called for `` iron-clad '' oil drilling safety plans Edward Markey told the House energy and commerce sub-committee Exxon-Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Shell all have identical response plans to BP . BP 's US chief Lamar McKay and four other oil bosses gave evidence amid accusations BP took shortcuts . President Barack Obama is to make a TV address later from the White House . He will use the prime-time speech , at 2000 -LRB- 0000 GMT -RRB- , to outline the next steps his administration will take against the spill . Those are reported to include new steps to restore the Gulf Coast ecosystem and explicit demands to ensure BP fully compensates those affected 
ret ==  Congress tells Hayward BP ignored oil well dangers During the course of the day , Mr Hayward faced attacks from both politicians and the audience House committee on energy and commerce chairman Henry Waxman said BP 's `` complacency '' before the 20 April rig explosion had been `` astonishing '' . He accused Mr Hayward of `` stonewalling '' for failing to answer his questions . As a public relations exercise for BP , the hearing was a disaster , a BBC correspondent says . David Willis BBC News , Washington Maybe it was President Obama 's decision to dispatch the Attorney General - Eric Holder - to the Gulf Of Mexico a few weeks back to look into the possibility of criminal charges against BP that made the company 's CEO so cautious as he gave testimony . Time after time , to their growing frustration , Tony Hayward told members of Congress that it would be `` premature '' to prejudge the outcome of investigations into the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon well nearly two months ago 
ret ==  BP CEO Tony Hayward criticised for yacht trip Mr Hayward and his son attended the Isle of Wight boat race BP CEO Tony Hayward has faced fresh criticism for taking time off to go sailing with his son instead of dealing with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The White House said the move was one of a `` long line of PR gaffes and mistakes '' by Mr Hayward . Environmental groups said the Isle of Wight outing was `` insulting '' to those affected by the environmental disaster . BP defended Mr Hayward , saying it was his first day off since the spill began after a deadly rig blast on 20 April . Mr Hayward spent the day with his son at the JP Morgan Asset Management Round The Island Race , where boats race around the Isle of Wight , off the coast of southern England 
ret ==  Mr Hayward initially said the impact would be ` very modest ' In the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , BP chief executive Tony Hayward has been criticised for a series of public relations setbacks that have enraged residents of the Gulf coast and US politicians . Earlier this month , President Barack Obama said in a television interview that Mr Hayward `` would n't be working for me after any of those statements '' . Here is a selection of what he has said and done to cause the controversy : President Obama 's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on Mr Hayward 's `` PR gaffe '' Mr Hayward is criticised by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel for taking time off to go sailing . In an interview with ABC News , Mr Emanuel says it has `` just been part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes '' . `` I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting 
ret ==  Environmental activist Dave Janka shows Rajesh Mirchandani oil from the Valdez still in local waters Before the BP accident in the Gulf of Mexico , America 's worst offshore oil leak was the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . Twenty-one years later , the BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani went to a nearby fishing village to see how its people had recovered - and found not all of them had . Surrounded by jagged snow-covered peaks and perched on the edge of a chilly fjord on Prince William Sound , the small Alaskan fishing town of Cordova is in a beautiful part of the world . But 21 years after one of the worst environmental disasters in US history , it remains scarred . In March 1989 , the Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef and spewed 11m gallons of crude oil into the sound 's pristine waters , and , until April 's BP accident in the Gulf of Mexico , it was America 's worst spill 
ret ==  BP set to begin oil drilling off Libya The Gulf of Mexico spill has raised serious safety concerns for BP Oil giant BP has confirmed it will begin drilling off the Libyan coast in the next few weeks . The deepwater drilling will take place in the Gulf of Sirte following a deal signed in 2007 with Libya on oil and gas development . The news comes amid major concerns over BP 's environmental and safety record following the Gulf of Mexico spill . It also follows claims , denied by BP , that it lobbied for Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi 's release . The Libyan was convicted of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over the Scottish town in 1988 , killing 270 people , but was freed by the Scottish government on medical grounds last August 
ret ==  Greenpeace said it wanted the company to adopt greener policies BP filling stations across London have been shut down by activists . Environmental group Greenpeace said it had cut fuel supplies to all 50 BP stations in the city . The oil firm said 35 to 40 had been shut but many of them have now reopened . The protesters stopped the fuel by removing safety switches on forecourts . The action comes as BP reported an # 11bn loss after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and confirmed chief executive Tony Hayward is to step down 
ret ==  Tony Hayward says BP was ` not prepared ' for the Gulf oil spill Former BP boss Tony Hayward says the company was `` not prepared '' to deal with media scrutiny over the Gulf oil disaster The former boss of BP Tony Hayward has admitted that the company was `` not prepared '' to deal with fallout over the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and the media `` feeding frenzy '' surrounding it . In his first interview since resigning Tony Hayward said as the face of BP he had been `` demonised and vilified '' , but he understood why . The blast on 20 April killed 11 workers and caused one of the worst environmental disasters in US history . It took five months for the well to be completely sealed . BP was widely condemned for its slow response to the leak , which pumped out around half a million barrels of oil in to the gulf during the first month 
ret ==  Mike O'Berry , US Coast Guard : `` We 'll search until all likelihood of success has passed '' The US Coast Guard says that no oil appears to be leaking from a rig that sank off Louisiana on Thursday . Crews will continue to monitor the rig closely amid concerns over a possible environmental disaster . BP chief executive Tony Hayward vowed that the company would do everything in its power to contain any spills and limit the environmental impact . The Coast Guard is continuing its search for 11 missing workers , but hopes for their survival are dimming . Coast Guard Rear Adm Mary Landry told Associated Press news agency that there was no leak at either the water 's surface or the well head at the ocean floor 
ret ==  The Deepwater Horizon sank following an explosion and fire By Michael Hirst and David Walker Stopping a potentially devastating slick from a damaged oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is only part of the headache currently facing BP . The company also faces a massive clean-up bill , plus legal action from those affected and possible damage to its global brand . It is not the first time BP has faced controversy and anger in the US . An explosion at a refinery in south Houston in 2005 killed 15 people and injured 170 , the worst US industrial accident since 1990 . BP was fined a record $ 87m -LRB- # 53m -RRB- after US health and safety experts cited 270 violations at the refinery 
ret ==  Gulf oil spill could be unprecedented disaster - Obama President Obama said he would ` spare no effort ' in responding to the crisis US President Barack Obama has described a sprawling oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico as a `` potentially unprecedented '' environmental disaster . Speaking in Louisiana , Mr Obama said his government would do whatever it takes to clean up the oil , adding that BP was responsible and must pay . He said the focus was now on preventing any further damage to the Gulf coast . BP says it will be at least a week before temporary measures to stem the leak are in place . But it could take up to three months to drill relief wells that could fully contain the spillage , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar warned on Sunday 
ret ==  Tony Hayward said there was an `` armada '' of ships trying to clean the spill Oil giant BP has acknowledged it is `` absolutely responsible '' for cleaning up a huge oil spill after an explosion at one of its wells off the US coast . But BP boss Tony Hayward said the firm was not to blame for the accident which sank the Deepwater Horizon rig on 22 April , causing the slick . He said the equipment that failed belonged to drilling firm Transocean . Both companies are expecting lawsuits over the slick , which threatens to cause major ecological damage . US President Barack Obama has described the oil leak as a `` potentially unprecedented '' environmental disaster 
ret ==  BP ` must pay ' oil spill costs US President Barack Obama is pressing for a law that would force British Petroleum to pay the full cost of the oil leak off the Gulf of Mexico . The bill could run into billions of dollars . Five thousand barrels of oil a day continue to spew into the Gulf of Mexico threatening five states . The investigations into the accident are far from over but United States senators have heard evidence from the companies involved that it might have been caused by a combination of faulty wiring , a leak in the equipment designed to prevent blowouts and even a dead battery . President Obama has written to Congress saying he will spare no effort trying to help those hit by what he calls a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster 
ret ==  US oil spill ` enters Loop Current ' with Florida at risk Oil has been gushing out of the blown-out well for almost a month The first oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill has entered an ocean current that could take it to Florida and up the east coast of the US , scientists say . A `` small portion '' of oil sheen is in the Loop Current , which circulates in the Gulf , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- said . Diluted oil could appear in isolated parts of Florida if persistent winds pushed the current that way , it added . European scientists warn the spill could reach Florida within six days . Oil has been spewing into the Gulf since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , leased by oil giant BP , exploded off the coast of Louisiana on 20 April and sank two days later 
ret ==  BP has fallen short in providing oil leak data , says US Video from BP appears to show vast quantities of oil still leaking from the well BP has `` fallen short '' in providing data about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the US government has said , in its latest critical letter to the firm . The Obama administration said the British energy giant should act in a `` transparent manner '' and `` promptly '' make all information public . Earlier , BP said more oil than the 5,000 barrels a day it first estimated were gushing from the burst well . The spill has reached Louisiana and is threatening Florida and Cuba . The crude has been flowing since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , leased by BP , exploded off the coast of Louisiana on 20 April and sank two days later 
ret ==  Greenpeace campaigners unfurled a protest banner at BP 's headquarters BP has said more oil than the 5,000 barrels a day it initially estimated is flowing from a burst oil well into the Gulf of Mexico . The energy giant said a long tube it inserted into the gusher at the weekend was now siphoning 5,000 barrels a day , but that more was escaping . Meanwhile , US officials have ordered BP to use a less toxic chemical to disperse the crude . The spill has reached Louisiana and is now threatening Florida and Cuba . Oil has been gushing since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , leased by BP , exploded off the coast of Louisiana on 20 April and sank two days later 
ret ==  US oil spill : BP ` recovering less oil ' than estimated Video from BP appears to show vast quantities of oil still leaking from the well BP has said the amount of oil recovered from a leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well on Thursday was less than half an earlier estimate . BP said it had siphoned 2,200 barrels in the 24-hour period to midnight on Thursday , down from an estimate of 5,000 barrels earlier in the day . The US government has formed a team to develop a more precise estimate of the amount of oil gushing from the well . BP will attempt to stem the oil flow next week , instead of Sunday as hoped . The oil leak began more than a month ago , when a rig leased by BP exploded 
ret ==  Obama names oil-spill panel heads President Obama said the commision would look at how the oil industry operates They are ex-Democratic Senator Bob Graham and former Republican environment chief William Reilly . The president said he wanted to make sure such a disaster never happened again . The panel has six months to compile its report . President Obama 's administration has been forced to defend its record in dealing with the spill . The oil leak began more than a month ago , when a rig leased by BP exploded , killing 11 people and spewing millions of gallons of oil into the ocean 
ret ==  Oil is now coating beaches and marshland along miles of coastline BP has begun sharing details of its internal inquiry into the causes of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill with the US government . It said its investigation was focused on seven control mechanisms that should have prevented the 20 April oil rig explosion and resulting spill . The oil giant will try to plug the leaking well in a so-called `` top kill '' operation on Wednesday . US President Barack Obama is to tour the Gulf state of Louisiana on Friday . The announcement of his visit - scheduled a day after he is due to be given a report into the spill - comes as the administration faces growing scrutiny over its oversight of efforts to handle the disaster 
ret ==  US President Barack Obama ` to extend oil drilling ban ' BP hope to stem the flow of oil by pumping mud into the breached well US President Barack Obama is set to extend a moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling for six months , the White House says . The move comes as his administration faces criticism of its handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The ban will stay in place while a commission further investigates the circumstances of the disaster . BP says its latest effort to stem the flow of oil from the well after a rig explosion is going to plan . Thousands of barrels of oil have been spewing into the Gulf at a depth of 1
ret ==  The company 's `` top kill '' effort has `` stabilised the wellhead '' , Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen said . But he cautioned it was too early to declare success . This is the first step in BP 's plan to seal the well for good . Meanwhile , a panel of US scientists said the oil leak was much worse than previously estimated , making it the nation 's worst spill . US Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said BP ` slows leaking Gulf oil well ' government teams estimated the flow ranges from 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons or 1
ret ==  Obama defends Gulf of Mexico oil spill response President Obama : `` People are going to be frustrated until -LRB- the leak -RRB- stops '' US President Barack Obama has defended his government 's handling of the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . He unveiled a series of measures , including a continued moratorium on drilling permits for six months . The move comes after an opinion poll said 60 % of Americans were unhappy with the government 's response . BP has resumed pumping heavy mud into the ruptured well after a pause to assess the effect of its `` top kill '' operation . The procedure is aimed at stemming the oil flow , from what some experts say is the country 's worst-ever spill 
ret ==  ` Top kill ' BP operation to halt US oil leak fails Doug Suttles of BP : `` We have been unable to overcome the flow '' The latest attempt to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil leak has failed , the oil giant BP has said . BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said the firm was now shifting to a new strategy to stop the spill . In the failed procedure - known as `` top kill '' - the firm had been blasting waste material and heavy mud into a ruptured well . US President Barack Obama said the continued flow of oil was `` as enraging as it is heartbreaking '' . The worst oil spill in US history began when a drilling rig exploded and sank last month , killing 11 people 
ret ==  BP 's shares fall 13 % after plan to stop oil leak fails BP plans to use underwater robots to cut a damaged pipe and lower a cap Oil giant BP 's share price has closed down 13 % after falling at one stage to its lowest level in 15 months . The sell-offs came as the firm 's so-called `` top kill '' bid failed to plug the massive spill from its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico . BP said later that it hoped to contain the spill `` within 24 hours '' by sealing the fractured pipe with a cap . Meanwhile , the US government said it would launch criminal and civil proceedings against BP . An operation to cap the leak was launched on Tuesday using underwater robots 
ret ==  Gulf oil spill : BP hopes to cap flow ` within 24 hours ' BP plans to use underwater robots to cut a damaged pipe and lower a cap BP hopes to contain the spill from its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico within 24 hours , its chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , has said . An operation using undersea robots to cut off the fractured pipe and seal it with a cap was launched on Tuesday . It comes as US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that officials had begun criminal and civil investigations into America 's worst oil spill . Mr Holder would not say which companies or individuals were being targeted . Reuters news agency quotes BP as saying it would `` co-operate with any inquiry that the Department of Justice undertakes '' 
ret ==  Attorney General Eric Holder on the criminal investigation He would not say which companies or individuals were being targeted . Earlier , BP launched a new attempt to try to contain the spill from its well using undersea robots to cut off the fractured pipe and seal it with a cap . BP said the spill - the largest in US history - might be capped within 24 hours , but success was not guaranteed . BP 's shares fell sharply on Tuesday following the failure of its previous efforts to `` top kill '' the leak by pumping mud into the well . At one stage the share price hit its lowest level for 15 months , as stock markets digested the news that the US was `` prepared for the worst scenario '' that the leak might not be stopped before August 
ret ==  Louisiana is already feeling the effects of the oil spill A sheen of oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill is nearing the white sand beaches of north-west Florida , officials say . The slick , containing thousands of tar balls , is only nine miles -LRB- 15km -RRB- from Pensacola on the Florida `` panhandle '' . `` It 's inevitable that we will see it on the beaches , '' said Keith Wilkins , an Escambia County official . Meanwhile , BP 's efforts to cap the leaking well got back on track as a saw that had become stuck in a thick pipe on the sea bed for hours was freed . The company is attempting to contain the spill from the well by cutting off the fractured pipe and sealing it with a cap 
ret ==  Oil company BP says it will pay for the construction of six sand barriers off the coast of the US state of Louisiana to try to protect fragile wetlands from a huge oil slick . BP - which is battling to cap a damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico - says the project will cost about $ 360m -LRB- # 244m -RRB- . The sandbanks will join together a chain of natural offshore islands , forming a 50-mile -LRB- 80km -RRB- barrier . Meanwhile , a slick is nearing the white sand beaches of north-west Florida . The slick , containing thousands of tar balls - heavy globs of decayed oil - is only seven miles -LRB- 11km -RRB- from Pensacola on the Florida `` panhandle '' , officials said 
ret ==  BP reaches key ` milestone ' in halting Gulf oil leak BP CEO Tony Hayward says cutting away the riser was a ` very important step ' Oil company BP says it has cut a ruptured pipe from the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , a key step in the latest effort to cap the well . BP chief Tony Hayward hailed it as an `` important milestone '' and said BP could know within the next 12 to 24 hours if the capping effort would succeed . For now , undersea robots are preparing the well-head to receive the cap . President Barack Obama is to visit the gulf on Friday , his third trip there since the leak began six weeks ago . The White House has been under increasing pressure to show the administration is in control of the response and clean-up efforts 
ret ==  Gulf spill : US tests confirm underwater oil plumes Barack Obama hits out at Tony Hayward - Clip courtesy NBC 's Today show Tests have shown that underwater oil plumes have traveled at least 40 miles from a leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , the US government says . Scientists noted that concentrations of oil in the plumes were `` very low . '' Meanwhile , US Coast Guard chief Thad Allen has said a containment cap placed on a blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico last week is helping to contain more of the leaking oil . President Barack Obama has criticised BP 's chief executive over the disaster . Mr Obama told US network NBC that he would have fired Tony Hayward over remarks the British chief executive made on behalf of BP 
ret ==  Gulf spill : Salazar reassures over oil drilling pause US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said drilling would continue in a `` safe way '' US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has told a senate panel that a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling will stay in place until safety is assured . But he sought to reassure senators that the moratorium - imposed after the huge Gulf of Mexico spill - was a `` pause '' rather a permanent halt to exploration . Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen said the amount of oil captured from the leaking well could almost double by next week . President Barack Obama has criticised BP 's efforts to deal with the spill . He is due to make his fourth trip to the Gulf of Mexico next week 
ret ==  The spill is the worst environmental disaster in US history A BP document has revealed the company estimated that 100,000 barrels of oil a day could , in theory , flow from the ruptured Gulf of Mexico well . That amount , included in an undated internal document released by US Congressman Ed Markey , is nearly twice the current US estimate of the leak . BP says the 100,000 figure is not relevant as it is not based on reality . US lawmakers have repeatedly accused BP of not being straightforward about the true size of the spill . Mr Markey - a senior Democrat and chairman of one of the committees investigating the Gulf spill - said the document raised troubling questions about what BP knew about the size of the spill and when they knew it 
ret ==  BP refits Gulf of Mexico oil cap after accident Footage shows the crude oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as Admiral Thad Allen of the US Coast Guard explains how the accident happened BP says it has reinstalled a containment cap on its blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico after an accident unleashed a torrent of oil . BP was forced to remove the cap after an underwater robot bumped into the venting system . Gas had risen through the vent that carried warm water down to prevent ice-like crystals from forming in the cap . The cap has been partially containing the leaking oil and directing some of it to a surface ship . The decision to remove the cap for repairs meant that oil was flowing unhindered into the ocean for about 10 hours on Wednesday 
ret ==  Two months after an explosion on BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 people , Panorama 's Hilary Andersson tells the story of America 's ` greatest environmental disaster . ' Dubbed an environmental ' 9\/11 ' by President Obama , the leak caused by the explosion is still releasing thousands of barrels of crude oil a day into the waters of the Gulf - livelihoods and ecosystems are threatened , fishermen are unable to work and billions have been wiped off the value of BP shares . Panorama examines the full consequences of the disaster amid a mounting war of words between the Obama adminstration and an embattled BP , asking what went wrong and who is really to blame . You must enable javascript to play content Workers on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig told Panorama 's Hilary Andersson of the horrors of the night the rig exploded and their battle for survival amid the flames . BP was told of oil safety fault ` weeks before blast ' A deepwater horizon rig worker said he identified a leak in its equipment weeks before the blast that caused the Gulf of Mexico oil spill 
ret ==  Gulf oil spill reaches Texas as tar balls wash ashore It is not clear if the tar balls drifted from the spill or were carried on a ship Tar balls have landed on a Texas beach , meaning oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill has hit all five US Gulf states . Tests identified the small amount of tar found on the Bolivar Peninsula , north-east of Galveston , as coming from BP 's blown-out well off Louisiana . But officials said it was unclear if it had drifted hundreds of kilometres from the leak site or had fallen from ships taking part in the clean-up operation . Up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day have leaked into the Gulf since 22 April . BP has said its oil-capture systems collected or burnt off 24,980 barrels of oil on Monday , according to the Reuters news agency 
ret ==  BP must give answers on oil well , US government says The new cap should make a more secure seal over the leaking wellhead BP has been given 24 hours to answer questions on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the US government 's incident commander said . Adm Thad Allen sent a letter to the oil giant 's managing director saying the company must hand over `` detailed plans and timelines '' on stopping the leak . The information is needed before BP is allowed to change caps on the oil well . Meanwhile , a court has rejected the government 's bid to restore an offshore deepwater oil drilling moratorium . The federal appeals court in Louisiana denied the Obama administration 's request that a lower court 's June order lifting the six-month moratorium be stayed pending appeal 
ret ==  BP begins to fit new cap on Gulf of Mexico oil leak The BBC 's Madeleine Morris says it may take days to complete the operation Underwater robots have successfully removed a leaking cap on BP 's blown-out Gulf of Mexico oil well , the first stage in fitting a tighter cap . However , many thousands of barrels of oil will now flow freely until the new cap is fitted , an operation that could take four to seven days . BP also said there was no guarantee of success at such a depth . A fleet of 400 skimmers is in place to try to minimize the effects of increased oil loss . The company has two other operations ongoing 
ret ==  BP faces 7-year offshore drilling ban BP has already accepted its guilt in a separate accident in Texas in 2005 that killed 15 A US Congressional committee has agreed measures that would ban BP from new offshore drilling for seven years . The House committee on natural resources voted in favor of precluding companies with poor safety records from offshore oil exploration permits . The proposed law does not name BP , but would apply to any company that has experienced 10 or more deaths in the last seven years . The April explosion of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers . According to the draft legislation , the deaths must have taken place at drilling , production facilities , or refineries , and must have broken US health and environment laws 
ret ==  Ships evacuated from Gulf as tropical storm advances BP 's Doug Suttles says the storm could delay plans by up to two weeks Dozens of ships in the Gulf of Mexico are preparing to leave the site of the BP oil spill as Tropical Storm Bonnie gathers pace . Incident commander Admiral Thad Allen said the well would remain capped while ships evacuated the Gulf . Drilling on a relief well has been suspended for up to two weeks . Bonnie is the second named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , with wind speeds of 40mph -LRB- 65km\/h -RRB- , the US National Hurricane Center says . Forecasters say the edge of the tropical storm could reach the spill area by early on Saturday 
ret ==  Some of the vessels deployed to the spill site are slow-moving Workers at the Gulf of Mexico BP oil spill site are making final preparations to leave as a storm nears . Work on the relief wells which BP hopes to use to permanently stop the leak is due to be suspended . But incident commander Adm Thad Allen has allowed the damaged well to remain capped while the site is evacuated . He said ships monitoring the sea bed for signs of problems will be the last to leave the site and the first to return . `` The seismic survey vessels , the acoustic vessels and the vessels operating the ROVs -LRB- remote-operated vehicles -RRB- will stay as long as possible , '' said Adm Allen 
ret ==  BP said any relevant lessons would be applied off Shetland Calls to halt BP 's plans to begin a deep drilling operation off Shetland , in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico disaster , have been rejected . The oil giant wants to drill in a field 60 miles off the islands and the operation is due to begin in October . Greenpeace said an accident off Scotland similar to the Deepwater Horizon explosion would `` wreak havoc '' . BP and the Department of Energy and Climate Change said they did not believe it necessary to halt drilling . Greenpeace is calling for a US-style moratorium on deep sea drilling 
ret ==  Dispersant used in Gulf ` no more toxic ' than oil alone The Macondo well has been temporarily sealed with a cap for two weeks The EPA study follows concerns raised by congressional investigators that dispersant may have been more widely used than the government ordered . Meanwhile a new US government estimate suggests the well leaked 4.9 m barrels of oil before being capped last month . The estimate would make it the largest accidental oil spill in world history . According to the new estimate prepared by the government 's Flow Rate Technical Group , BP was able to collect roughly 800,000 barrels of oil from the well in total 
ret ==  Admiral Thad Allen outlined the terms of the '' static kill '' BP says it plans to inject mud and possibly cement into its Gulf of Mexico oil well on Tuesday , in one of the final steps to permanently seal it . The `` static kill '' , as the procedure is called , will begin if preliminary tests are positive , a BP executive said . More mud and cement would then be pumped in from a relief well within five to seven days , said the US Coast Guard officer overseeing the operation . Only that `` bottom kill '' would fully seal the well , said Admiral Thad Allen . `` We want to confirm we can inject the oil in the wellbore back into the reservoir , '' said Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice-president of exploration and production 
ret ==  BP starts ` static kill ' to plug Gulf of Mexico oil well The Macondo well has been temporarily sealed with a cap for just over two weeks BP has started the `` static kill '' of its leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , a step towards permanently sealing it . Specially formulated mud is being pumped in from the top , forcing oil back down into the well . After the procedure - which could last up to two-and-a-half days - the top of the well could be filled with cement . The US government estimates the well leaked 4.9 million barrels of oil before being capped last month , with only 800,000 barrels being captured 
ret ==  BP gears up to plug ` world 's biggest ' oil spill The Macondo well has been temporarily sealed with a cap for just over two weeks The US government has said the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the biggest oil leak ever , as BP prepares its `` static kill '' operation to permanently seal its well . A new government estimate suggests BP 's Macondo well leaked 4.9 million barrels of oil before being capped last month . Scientists said only a fifth of the leaking oil - around 800,000 barrels - was captured during the clean-up . The well broke open after an explosion on a drilling rig in April 
ret ==  Transocean is the world 's largest offshore drilling contractor Offshore drilling firm Transocean has seen quarterly profits drop due to legal costs and reduced income after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill . It lost its rig in the April blowout , which also resulted in a reduction in drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , where Transocean had 14 other deepwater rigs . Second-quarter net profit fell to $ 715m -LRB- # 450m -RRB- from $ 806m a year earlier . The profit includes $ 267m resulting from insurance recoveries associated with the loss of Deepwater Horizon . That has helped towards costs of $ 69m associated with the well blow-out , and another $ 18m of expenses in other legal costs 
ret ==  BP says ` static kill ' to stop oil leak was successful BP pumped mud into the well for eight hours during the procedure BP says the `` static kill '' of its ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well has worked , a big step towards sealing it . In the procedure , special drilling fluid known as mud is pumped into the well , forcing the oil back down . BP said well pressure was being controlled by the pressure of the mud , which was `` the desired outcome '' . Meanwhile , a government report due to be published today is expected to say that only 26 % of the leaked oil poses any further danger to the environment . About three-quarters of the escaped oil has already evaporated , dispersed , been captured or otherwise eliminated , according to a new analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- , reported in the New York Times 
ret ==  Majority of BP spill ` dealt with ' President Obama : `` The long battle to stop the leak and contain the oil is finally close to coming to an end '' Almost three-quarters of the oil spilled in the Gulf of Mexico has been cleaned up or broken down by natural forces , the US government has said . A government report says only a quarter of the oil from the BP well remains and that it is `` degrading quickly '' . The majority has been captured , burned off or evaporated , it states . But more clean-up is necessary , officials warn . Meanwhile , the government has cleared BP to cement the blown oil well , one of the final steps required to seal it 
ret ==  There is still oil out there BP has finished pumping cement into the top of its damaged Gulf of Mexico oil well as part of its `` static kill '' procedure . The move comes the day after it was announced that almost three-quarters of the oil spilled had been broken down by natural forces or cleaned up . Oil leaked into the Gulf from 20 April when the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion killed 11 workers . The flow was stopped on 15 July . Work on a relief well can now continue 
ret ==  The leak was capped in the middle of July BP has made an initial deposit of $ 3bn -LRB- # 1.8 bn -RRB- into a $ 20bn compensation fund for the oil spill , after completing talks with the US Department of Justice , according to BP officials . The fund , called an escrow account , was set up by the oil giant to compensate victims of the Gulf of Mexico spill . BP 's response has cost $ 6.1 bn already 
ret ==  The leak was capped in the middle of July The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion has so far cost BP a total of $ 6.1 bn -LRB- # 3.8 bn -RRB- , the company has said . The total includes the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , and cementing up of the damaged well . The sum also includes grants to the Gulf states hit by the spill 
ret ==  BP oil spill : Final Gulf of Mexico well seal delayed Drilling of the relief well was previously delayed because of bad weather An operation to permanently seal the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been delayed until early September , US officials say . Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said oil firm BP needed to replace key equipment before starting the procedure , which involves pumping cement into the well . BP had intended to start the process , known as `` bottom kill '' , in mid-August . We will know when we have satisfied ourselves and we have removed any shadow of doubt '' End Quote Adm Thad Allen US Coast Guard The flow of oil was stopped on 15 July , but officials say the bottom kill is needed as a permanent fix . Meanwhile , new research on the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill has confirmed the presence of a toxic chemical residue 1km -LRB- 0
ret ==  The blowout preventer is being slowly raised to the surface BP has replaced a damanged blowout preventer that failed to stop oil from leaking into the Gulf of Mexico when a drilling rig exploded in April . The 300-ton device will be examined as part of the inquiry into the leak of 206m gallons of oil into the Gulf . The company said it had spent $ 8bn -LRB- # 5.2 bn -RRB- in clean-up costs and compensation to Gulf residents . Meanwhile , BP have said a ban on offshore oil drilling may impede its ability to pay for the damage 
ret ==  BP shares blame over oil spill BP shares blame over oil spill Oil company BP says they are n't the only ones to blame for the oil spill that happened in the Gulf of Mexico . The company have released a report saying things went wrong because some equipment was n't working properly . BP accepts it 's partly their fault for not checking the equipment properly , but also blame other companies who worked for them for doing a bad job . Eleven people died , and many birds and animals were killed or injured after an oil rig exploded in April . It all started when an underwater rig exploded in April 
ret ==  The US is set to require oil companies to plug 3,500 non-producing Gulf of Mexico oil wells in an effort to prevent future leaks , officials say . The interior department will also require companies to dismantle 650 unused oil and gas platforms . Some installations have sat idle for decades without inspection for leaks . The order comes five months after an explosion at a BP oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico caused one of the worst environmental disasters in US history . In an order issued on Wednesday , the interior department said wells that had not been used in the past five years for exploration or oil production must be plugged and their pipelines and rig structures dismantled 
ret ==  On 20 April , the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , killing 11 workers and causing an oil spill that soon became the worst environmental disaster in US history . Here is a chronology of events in the months since , as BP has struggled to stem the leak and oil has washed ashore along the Gulf Coast , from the fragile Louisiana wetlands to the white sand beaches of Florida . The ruptured well is finally sealed and `` effectively dead '' , says the top US federal official overseeing the disaster , Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen . BP pumps cement to seal the damaged well after it was intercepted by a relief well . In its own internal report into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill - the first to be published since the disaster - BP spreads the blame for the 11 April explosion and resulting leak 
ret ==  BP finally seals leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well The oil leak has been the worst offshore spill in US history The ruptured well that has spewed millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico has finally been sealed , US officials say . A pressure test showed a cement plug put in place by BP to permanently `` kill '' the well was holding . President Obama hailed the news , vowing to continue to help those affected . The worst offshore oil spill in US history began after the Deepwater Horizon rig blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers and later sinking . The top US federal official overseeing the disaster , Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen , said on Sunday that the well was now `` effectively dead '' 
ret ==  BP oil leak in Gulf of Mexico is finally sealed The leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been permanently sealed , it has been confirmed . Experts have carried out a pressure test on the cement plug put in place by oil company BP to stop the leak . They say it is holding well . US President Barack Obama is really pleased with the news . He says work to help people affected must continue 
ret ==  Gulf of Mexico oil leak : US sues BP over oil disaster The Deepwater Horizon rig explosion led to what was described as the worst environmental catastrophe in US history The US is suing BP and eight other firms for allegedly violating federal safety regulations in connection with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The lawsuit asks that they be held liable without limitation for all clean-up and damage costs . The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion in April killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil over several months . The oil leak was described as the worst environmental disaster in US history . The lawsuit charges the companies under the US Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act 
ret ==  US government takes BP to court over oil spill The US government is taking BP and eight other companies to court - to try and make them pay for cleaning up the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Millions of barrels of oil poured into the sea after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in April . Eleven workers died in the blast . US officials say it happened because government safety rules were broken . But oil company BP does n't agree 
ret ==  The Deepwater Horizon rig explosion led to the worst environmental catastrophe in US history BP shares have fallen after the US said it was suing the oil giant for alleged violations of federal safety laws over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The lawsuit asks BP and and eight other firms be held liable without limitation for all clean-up and damage costs . The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion in April killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil over several months . BP 's shares in London ended Thursday trading down 1.4 % 
ret ==  20 April : A surge in oil and gas causes an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig . The blowout preventer system of valves -LRB- BOP -RRB- at the well head on the seabed is believed to have failed . 22 April : The oil rig sinks and the riser pipe that connected it to the well falls to the seabed . Oil and gas continue to flow from the pipe and blowout preventer , causing a five mile -LRB- 8km -RRB- oil slick . The blowout preventer is meant to be the ultimate fail safe against pressure surges 
ret ==  BP has been using undersea robots to fit the sealing cap Engineers have made `` significant progress '' towards putting a new cap on the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , US Coast Guard commander Thad Allen has said . Adm Allen , the commander overseeing the spill response , said : `` This could lead to the shutting of the well . '' BP hopes partly to close the cap on Tuesday to test the well 's integrity . Meanwhile , the US government issued a new deep-water drilling moratorium to replace one struck down in court . The moratorium was reworked by the US interior department in the hope of gaining the approval of a federal court that rejected the Obama administration 's earlier ban , saying it was too broad 
ret ==  BP installs new sealing cap on leaking Gulf oil well Footage shows an underwater camera view of the new cap being placed over the broken well head BP has successfully installed a new sealing cap on the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , company officials say . It is hoped the new cap will stop the leak and help capture all the oil before it can pour into the sea . But BP warned the cap system had never been deployed at such depths and said `` its efficiency and ability to contain the oil and gas can not be assured '' . It also said that the two relief wells being drilled remain the only way permanently to seal the leak . Folks here in Florida and across the Gulf Coast are still depending on visitors and tourist dollars to put food on their tables and to pay their mortgages and to send their kids to college '' End Quote Michelle Obama US First Lady on Gulf Coast visit Meanwhile , the US government issued a new deep-water drilling moratorium to replace one struck down in court 
ret ==  The BBC 's Andy Gallacher explains BP 's new plan BP has delayed a key test on a newly installed well cap aimed at stopping the flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico . BP and US Coast Guard officials said further analysis was needed before pressure testing could begin . If it proves successful , the well will be kept `` shut in '' and the leak halted until relief wells plug it entirely . The blown-out well has been spewing oil into Gulf waters since April . The US administration has sent BP and other parties a new bill for the clean-up 
ret ==  James Reynolds reports as BP say the oil has stopped leaking BP says it has temporarily stopped oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from its leaking well . It is the first time the flow has stopped since an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . The well has been sealed with a cap as part of a test of its integrity that could last up to 48 hours . US President Barack Obama said the development was a `` positive sign '' but noted that BP was still in the testing phase . BP executive Kent Wells said the oil had been stopped at 1425 local time -LRB- 1925 GMT -RRB- and he was `` excited '' by the progress 
ret ==  Gulf spill : BP prepares for key oil well test Adm Thad Allen : `` When BP is ready , we will start to increase the pressure in the capping stack '' Oil firm BP is preparing to test the strength of its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , in its latest bid to stop the flow . BP began shutting valves linked to the new cap , but a `` small leak '' in a pipe has delayed the tests . The firm said it would take a `` short while '' to fix . The tests will find out if the well can handle the pressure of the flow . BP hopes the cap will eventually stem the flow entirely - three months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded 
ret ==  Vital BP oil well test back on course after setback Adm Thad Allen : `` When BP is ready , we will start to increase the pressure in the capping stack '' BP has fixed a problem with the cap on the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , which delayed a crucial test . Work on starting the test , which was due to begin on Tuesday , has resumed . The oil giant needs to shut all the valves on the new cap in order to test the well 's integrity . If the test is successful the flow of oil could be halted until relief wells can stop the leak permanently . The government 's incident commander Thad Allen said `` hopefully '' the test would begin later on Thursday 
ret ==  BP awaits crucial Gulf of Mexico oil well test data Video feeds from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico continue to show no leaking oil Oil firm BP is awaiting test results from the blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico , a day after staunching the flow of oil for the first time since April . The firm is checking how much pressure the well can withstand while the valves on its new capping device are closed . US President Barack Obama hailed the move as a `` positive sign '' , and BP 's shares rallied in early trading in London after sharp rises in New York . Oil has been flowing from the well since a rig exploded on 20 April . Eleven workers were killed in the Deepwater Horizon explosion , and the oil spill has raised fears of an environmental catastrophe 
ret ==  President Obama : `` This is good news '' BP says it is encouraged by the first test data following its stoppage of the oil from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well . President Obama gave a cautious welcome but added : `` It is important we do n't get ahead of ourselves . '' Pressure within the well is steadily rising , a good sign , said Kent Wells , BP 's vice president . The oil has been stopped for the first time since 20 April , as part of a 48-hour test . Spilled oil has damaged hundreds of miles of Gulf coastline since April , with serious economic damage to the region 
ret ==  The well has temporarily stopped leaking oil , but beach clean-up efforts continue BP says there are no signs of leakage from its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , a day after the flow was stopped for the first time since April . No oil has escaped from the new cap sealing the well and there was no sign of any breach under the sea floor , BP executive Kent Wells said . However , more pressure testing is being done to check there are no ruptures . Earlier , the US official overseeing the spill response , Adm Thad Allen , said the latest tests were inconclusive . Adm Allen said the pressure test of the well would continue for several more hours 
ret ==  BP shares rose modestly on Friday after the group confirmed it had temporarily stopped oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from its leaking well . At the close of trading , shares were up 1.3 % , having risen as much as 5 % earlier in the day . It is the first time the flow has been stopped since an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . The well has been sealed with a cap as part of a test of its strength that could last up to 48 hours 
ret ==  President Obama : `` This is good news '' `` It is important we do n't get ahead of ourselves , '' he said . Incident commander Adm Thad Allen warned a test of the well did not show conclusively there were no other leaks . He said the test would continue for several more hours at least before BP reassesses to see whether the well should be opened again . Meanwhile , Mr Obama said : `` One of the problems with having this camera down there is , is that when the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done - and we 're not . '' A new cap was used on Thursday to stop the flow for the first time since 20 April , as part of a 48-hour test of the well 's integrity 
ret ==  NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL In June , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface . However , this continued to leak oil and has now been replaced with a better fitting device . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL When engineers removed the LMRP cap on 10 July , oil began to freely flow from the top of the blowout preventer once more . However , the Q4000 containment system continued to take some oil to the surface . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL Engineers then bolted on a new capping stack onto the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- 
ret ==  Testing of BP 's newly capped Gulf of Mexico oil well has been extended for a further 24 hours . The US official in charge of the spill clean-up , Admiral Thad Allen , said the `` integrity test '' would not stop until Sunday afternoon . He added that when the test ceased , containment of the spill using surface ships to collect oil would resume . The new cap has managed to stop the flow of oil for the first time since the well exploded three months ago . The flow of oil was shut off at 1425 local time -LRB- 1925 GMT -RRB- on Thursday 
ret ==  Hopes are rising for the first time since the blast Tests on BP 's newly capped Gulf of Mexico oil well show pressure has been building up slightly as hoped with no signs of leakage , BP says . BP vice-president Kent Wells said rising pressure `` is giving us more and more confidence '' . However , tests have been extended for another 24 hours . The new cap has managed to stop the flow of oil for the first time since a 20 April explosion killed 11 people . The spill has been described as the worst environmental disaster in the US 
ret ==  Seepages near the leaking BP oil well ` may be natural ' Adm Thad Allen says the integrity of the capped well is not threatened Seepages on the sea floor near the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well may be unrelated to the well itself , the government 's incident commander says . Adm Thad Allen said there were concerns over three areas of `` anomaly '' during monitoring for a pressure test on the well . The well has been capped to see if the flow of oil can be stopped without provoking leaks in the sea bed . If the test fails , the well will be re-opened and oil will flow out again . Adm Allen outlined the three areas of concern 
ret ==  Vessels on the surface are ready to resume collecting the oil The US fears oil may be seeping from the ocean floor near the stricken Gulf of Mexico oil well . The official in charge of the clean-up , Thad Allen , said if a substance leaking from the seabed was found to be methane this might mean oil was also leaking . He ordered BP to submit a plan to reopen the capped well if the seepage was confirmed , so that oil could be funnelled to the surface . But BP says it would take three days to start this process . During this time , the daily leakage of tens of thousands of barrels of oil , which had been capped last Thursday , could resume 
ret ==  Bad weather in Gulf could threaten BP oil spill site The Development Driller II has been drilling one of the two relief wells Experts are considering whether a possible tropical storm could disrupt work at the site of the BP oil spill . If bad weather over the Caribbean strengthens and then moves to the site in the Gulf of Mexico , ships will have to be withdrawn . It could mean no work on the relief well for up to two weeks . A final piece of casing needs to be cemented in place at the bottom of the relief well before it can then drill into the damaged well . Once the casing is in place , engineers could begin the last drilling within five to seven days and then `` kill '' the well with mud and cement 
ret ==  Oil leak repairs start final stages Engineers have begun the final stages of plugging the well in the Gulf of Mexico that caused the world 's worst accidental oil spill . The operation called Static Kill is well underway and so far the results look promising . The process involves pumping mud and cement into the well to push the oil back underground . It 's similar to the procedure that failed in May - but then the oil was still gushing freely . This time a cap is in place and still holding after two weeks 
ret ==  BP says oil spill cost up to $ 8bn The cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster continues to mount up for BP BP says the cost of its Gulf of Mexico oil spill has risen to $ 8bn -LRB- # 5.2 bn -RRB- - a rise of more than $ 2bn in the last month alone . The company said it had paid out about $ 399m in claims to those affected by the spill . Last week , responsibilty for the claims was transfered to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility -LRB- GCCF -RRB- , which has so far paid out a total of $ 38.5 m
ret ==  The price of BP bonds has fallen sharply , a sign markets consider it is more likely to default on its debt . The downturn began on Tuesday , after BP 's `` top kill '' plan failed to block a massive leak in the Gulf of Mexico by pumping mud into the well . But BP 's bonds continued to fall even as its shares recovered on Wednesday . Meanwhile , rating agencies Moody 's and Fitch both cut the firm 's credit rating on Thursday , and threaten further downgrades . Moody 's and Fitch each cut BP 's rating by a modest one notch , from Aa1 to Aa2 , and from AA + to AA , respectively 
ret ==  By Anthony Reuben Business reporter , BBC News London Mayor Boris Johnson has expressed concern about the `` anti-British rhetoric that seems to be permeating from America '' . Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today program , he said that he `` would like to see a bit of cool heads rather than endlessly buck-passing and name-calling '' . So why is there so much concern about the effect on the British economy ? BP is a huge company , but its shares have almost halved in value since the explosion that set off the spill in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April . Its stock market value has fallen from about # 125bn to about # 70bn , which may make other oil companies think about making a takeover bid , although shareholders would be unlikely to accept an offer at the current levels . There is also a chance that BP will end up not paying dividends this year and it is almost certain that the amount BP is having to pay out for the clean-up in the US will eventually affect the dividend 
ret ==  BP directors will meet on Monday to discuss whether to suspend dividends to shareholders , the BBC has learned . Executives will then meet US President Barack Obama on Wednesday , but no announcement on the payments is expected in the near future . BP has been under intense pressure from the US government , which wants BP to use the money to pay for the Gulf of Mexico clean-up . Meanwhile , BP 's shares closed up 7.2 % , recovering losses suffered on Thursday 
ret ==  BP credit rating downgraded by Fitch BP has seen its share price fall dramatically since the oil leak began Fitch Ratings , one of the three big credit rating agencies , has downgraded BP following the disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The oil giant 's rating has been cut by six notches , from AA to BBB . The move means Fitch is less confident of BP 's ability to repay its debts following the huge clean-up and legal costs the company is expected to rack up as a result of the spill . Fitch expressed concerns about `` BP 's fundamental financial flexibility '' . The incident has so far cost BP $ 1
ret ==  President Obama 's statement about BP 's compensation fund Oil giant BP is to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- in a compensation fund for victims of the Gulf oil spill and will not pay shareholders a dividend this year . Barack Obama announced the compensation deal after talks at the White House with senior BP executives . Shortly afterwards , BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said dividends would not be paid for the rest of this year . The payout fund is to be run by Kenneth Feinberg , a lawyer who oversaw compensation after the 9\/11 attacks 
ret ==  BP shares have closed up almost 7 % after it agreed to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- in a fund to compensate victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The increase halted falls that had led to the company 's stock value halving in recent weeks . Investors said BP 's agreement with the White House had `` removed some of the uncertainty '' surrounding the company . The rise comes despite the announcement that BP shareholders will not receive dividend payments this year 
ret ==  BP 's oil spill : what has it cost you ? The major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has taken a huge toll on BP 's share value - almost halving it since the spill began in mid-April . In addition , the company has said it will not be paying any dividends to its shareholders this year , after agreeing to finance a $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- clean-up and compensation fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Given that BP is of great importance to the FTSE index of 100 leading companies and the country 's pension funds - what impact will its decline in value and the scrapping of dividends have in practice ? What has happened to my BP shares ? BP shareholders have seen a direct impact , with the value of the company 's shares almost halving since the spill on 20 April . There have been two main factors behind the fall in BP 's share price 
ret ==  BP suffers third rating downgrade The Gulf of Mexico oil disaster could cost BP $ 40bn , analysts say Moody 's downgraded BP 's creditworthiness by three notches , following similar moves by the other two rating agencies earlier this week . Earlier Russian President Dmitry Medvedev added further pressure on BP . He warned that the oil giant might face `` annihilation '' as a result of the fall-out of the oil disaster . In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , the Russian president described the spill as a `` wake-up call '' , and said that `` hopefully -LRB- BP -RRB- can afford the losses '' . But BP 's chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg later dismissed those comments 
ret ==  BP 's share price has plunged since the oil disaster began One of BP 's top bosses is due in Aberdeen to reassure staff the company has no plans to leave the North Sea . The firm faces enormous costs for the Gulf of Mexico explosion , which left 11 people dead and caused a major leak . Bernard Looney , managing director of BP North Sea , has dismissed speculation the company was planning to sell North Sea assets to help fund the costs . He is expected to address staff in Aberdeen on Monday before flying offshore on Tuesday . The Deepwater Horizon drill rig exploded in April , leaving a ruptured well leaking hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico 
ret ==  Shares in BP have risen amid speculation that Middle East investors may buy stakes in the oil giant . The shares closed up 3 % at 333.3 p following media reports suggesting that BP is seeking investment from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds . BP refused to comment directly on the speculation , but said it `` welcomed new investors '' . The oil company has been seen as a possible takeover target following the recent collapse in its share price 
ret ==  BP ` good value ' says leading Libyan oil executive The Gulf of Mexico oil spill has also proved a disaster for BP 's share price A leading Libyan oil executive has said he will recommend that the country 's sovereign wealth fund buys a stake in troubled oil giant BP . Shokri Ghanem , chairman of Libya 's National Oil Company , said BP shares were `` good value for bargain hunters '' . His comments follow reports on Monday that BP is seeking investment from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds . BP shares have almost halved in value following the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster , which began in April . `` BP is interesting now , with the price lower by half and I still have trust in BP 
ret ==  One of BP 's partners in the deepwater well which exploded in April - leading to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - has refused to pay its share of the costs so far . Houston-based Anadarko , which owns 25 % of the Macondo well , was asked to pay $ 272m -LRB- # 180m -RRB- by BP . But an Anadarko spokesman said it was going to withhold payment . BP said it was `` disappointed '' that the firm had `` failed to live up to their obligations '' . `` Anadarko 's refusal to pay their share will in no way affect BP 's commitment to stop the leak , clean up the spill , and pay all legitimate claims as quickly as possible '' , spokesman Mark Salt added 
ret ==  BP sells Pan American Energy stake for $ 7bn BP is raising cash to pay the costs of the Deepwater Horizon explosion BP has said it will sell its interests in an Argentina-based company as part of its moves to pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . By offloading its 60 % stake in Pan American Energy to Bridas Corporation , BP will raise $ 7bn -LRB- # 4.5 m ; 5.3 bn euros -RRB- . The oil giant has now sold $ 20bn of assets since announcing in July its plan to divest itself of up to $ 30bn by the end of 2011 
ret ==  The Deepwater Horizon rig explosion led to the worst environmental catastrophe in US history BP shares have surged almost 6 % after reports that rival Royal Dutch Shell considered a takeover bid following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Speculation that BP may not need to tap all of its $ 20bn -LRB- # 13bn -RRB- compensation fund also helped to push the company 's shares up by 27 pence to 493p . The Daily Mail newspaper reported that Shell mulled a bid for BP when its shares slumped because of the spill . The share price rise comes despite a sharp fall in the price of oil . US light crude fell by $ 2
ret ==  BP and Russia in Arctic oil deal BP 's chief executive Bob Dudley : '' This is a historic moment for BP '' The `` strategic global alliance '' will see the firms exchange expertise in exploring the region . As part of the deal Rosneft will take 5 % of BP 's shares in exchange for approximately 9.5 % of Rosneft 's shares . It is BP 's first deal since the Deepwater Horizon spill last year , which cost it billions . The BP shares stake is worth just under $ 8bn -LRB- # 5bn -RRB- 
ret ==  Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says his government supports the BP-Rosneft deal The creation of a joint venture and a share swap between BP and Russian state-controlled energy firm Rosneft could not have happened at a better time for the two businesses . The deal to exploit potentially huge oil and gas deposits in Russia 's Arctic shelf is the first for BP after both its profit and reputation were hit by the disaster at the Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico last year . `` In spite of the Macondo experience , and at the same time because of it , BP is betting that its relationship with the Russian government , which has often been fraught with problems , will now be its savior , '' says IHS Global Insight 's senior energy analyst Andrew Neff . Alexander Nazarov , senior analyst at IFC Metropol , believes that BP has become something of `` an outcast '' among the leading global energy firms as a result of the oil spill , which has already cost it billions of dollars . Valery Nesterov , an oil and gas analyst at Troika Dialog , says that there have been attempts to force BP out of the US energy market in the aftermath of the spill 
ret ==  The slick has now grown to about 1,500 sq km There are fears of an environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , as efforts to clear up an oil spill have been suspended because of bad weather . A drilling rig leased by the oil company BP exploded and sank off the Louisiana coast last week . Some 1,000 barrels of oil a day are leaking into the sea from the damaged well , officials say . They say the oil leak has the potential to damage beaches , barrier islands and wetlands across the coastline . Eleven workers are still missing and presumed to have been killed in the accident 
ret ==  Robot vessels used to cap Gulf of Mexico oil leak The US Coast Guard has described it as a `` very serious spill '' Robotic submersibles are being used to try to stop oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico from a damaged well almost a mile -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the surface . Some 1,000 barrels -LRB- 42,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day have been gushing from the well since a drilling rig exploded and sank off the Louisiana coast last week . British oil company BP , which leased the rig , said the `` first-of-its-kind '' attempt would take 24 to 36 hours . A nearby oil platform has been evacuated as a precaution 
ret ==  Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano : This is a spill of national significance The US military has joined efforts to stop an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as fears rise about its scale . Five times as much oil as previously thought could be leaking from the well beneath where a rig exploded and sank last week , the US Coast Guard says . Rear Admiral Mary Landry said 5,000 barrels a day were thought to be gushing into the sea off Louisiana . The Department of Homeland Security has designated the spill as one of `` national significance '' . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who is to go to Louisiana to oversee operations , told reporters in Washington that this designation would allow resources to be ordered in from other areas of the US 
ret ==  BP under pressure as the US oil spillage crisis worsens BP is paying millions of dollars a day to clean up the oil slick BP shares are expected to come under more pressure amid news that the US oil spillage crisis is getting worse . As the slick headed for the US coastline , President Barack Obama said BP was `` ultimately responsible for funding ... clean-up operations '' 
ret ==  White House adviser tells ABC all new drilling is on hold The US administration has banned oil drilling in new areas of the US coast while the cause of the oil spill off Louisiana is investigated . White House adviser David Axelrod told ABC TV it wanted to know exactly what led to last week 's explosion on the BP-operated rig in the Gulf of Mexico . As many as 5,000 barrels of oil a day are thought to be spilling into the water , threatening US coastal areas . Florida Governor Charlie Crist declared a state of emergency on Friday . The order , which covers Escambia , Santa Rosa , Okaloosa , Walton , Bay and Gulf counties , says the oil slick `` is generally moving in a northerly direction and threatens Florida 's coast '' 
ret ==  Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano : This is a spill of national significance The US Coast Guard is investigating reports that oil has started washing ashore on the Gulf Coast from a leaking offshore well . Up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day are thought to be spilling into the water after last week 's explosion on a BP-operated rig , which then sank . President Barack Obama has pledged `` every single available resource '' to help . The US navy has been deployed to help avert a looming environmental disaster . The Coast Guard said it had sent investigators to confirm whether crude oil had begun to wash up on parts of the Louisiana shoreline 
ret ==  Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal warned the spill threatened their way of life Bad weather hampered efforts to tackle the huge Gulf of Mexico oil slick , with high seas and winds keeping boats and planes away from the clean-up site . Reports suggest that the slick is growing rapidly - one report said it had tripled in size in a day . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal warned that the spillage threatened the very way of life of people in his state . President Obama is due there on Sunday as is BP head Tony Hayward , who has been criticised over the BP response . Sheen from the spill has begun washing up on the Louisiana coast , fuelling fears of environmental disaster 
ret ==  Inmates could help oil clean-up Criticism of BP is mounting in the US over its handling of the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano urged BP to commit more resources to tackling the catastrophe . Critics of the British oil giant also include President Barack Obama , who is due to travel to the region on Sunday to assess efforts to contain the spill . The sprawling oil slick has begun washing up on the Louisiana coast and is threatening three other states . Up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day are gushing into the sea after the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank last week 
ret ==  Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal warned the spill threatened their way of life Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has warned that the sprawling Gulf of Mexico oil slick threatens the very way of life of people in his state . As President Barack Obama prepared to fly in to see the devastation for himself , experts said the slick had tripled in size in just days . Attorneys general from five affected US states will meet to discuss legal options , as pressure mounts on BP . Choppy seas and strong winds have been hampering the clean-up operation . The BP-operated Deepwater Horizon rig sank on 22 April , two days after a huge explosion that killed 11 workers 
ret ==  The dome will be lowered 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- under water to funnel leaking oil to the surface BP has managed to seal the smallest of the three leaks spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico , the company says . Oil is still gushing into the sea at a rate of about 800,000 litres a day , but officials say working with only two leaks makes tackling the spill easier . A controlled burn of the slick to remove oil from open water has also begun , AP news agency said . And a special containment box to funnel oil to the surface from the leaking well is being sent to the site . Engineers plan to lower the 100-tonne concrete and steel box over the site on Thursday , using remote-controlled submarines , officials say 
ret ==  Hair and fur stuffed into tights are the latest tool in the Deepwater Horizon clean-up . The hairy booms wo n't plug leaks on the seabed , but will be floated off beaches to mop up oil washing towards shore . Making one of the oil spill hair booms How 's your hair - shower-fresh , or a bit greasy around the roots ? We wash our hair because it collects the oils our bodies produce . And it 's this property of hair - and fur and wool - that means it will be used to help tackling the oil spewing from BP 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico . It 's adsorbent rather than absorbent , meaning oil clings to the many tiny scales on each strand of hair 
ret ==  ` Top hat ' dome at Gulf of Mexico oil spill site - BP BP says the new dome should be working by the end of the week A new steel dome has been placed beside the damaged oil well that has been polluting the Gulf of Mexico since last month 's drilling rig disaster , BP says . Dubbed the `` top hat '' , it is smaller than a first container dome which had to be set aside after becoming blocked by crystallised gas hydrates . It is on the seabed but is being kept away from the well for now , BP said . The cost of tackling the spill is being put at $ 118m -LRB- # 80m -RRB- , much of which the Obama administration expects BP to pay . The figure is contained in legislation sent to Congress , which would also increase a tax on oil companies to provide funds for clear-up work 
ret ==  BP plans to slowly increase the amount of oil and gas flowing up the pipe The oil company BP says it has successfully started to siphon oil from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well to a tanker on the surface . BP executive Kent Wells would not say how much oil was being siphoned but said the process was `` working well '' . BP succeeded on its third attempt to insert a long narrow tube into the leaking pipe , using underwater robots . Earlier , scientists said they had found vast underwater plumes of oil , one 10 miles -LRB- 16km -RRB- long and a mile wide . It is thought that BP 's 6in-wide -LRB- 15cm -RRB- tube and stopper could capture more than three-quarters of the leak , although a smaller spill nearby also has to be contained 
ret ==  US says BP move to curb oil leak ` no solution ' A boom is erected in Louisiana to counter the spill The success of a move by oil giant BP to curb a leak in the Gulf of Mexico is `` not clear '' and the technique provides `` no solution '' , the US has said . It was responding to BP 's move to siphon oil from the leaking well head to a tanker on the surface . A government statement said it would not rest until the leak was permanently sealed and the spill cleaned up . BP executive Kent Wells earlier said that the siphoning process was `` working extremely well '' . This was the third attempt it had made to insert a long narrow tube into the leaking pipe , using underwater robots 
ret ==  Sea birds covered in spilt oil are being treated in Louisiana Oil spilling out of a ruptured pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico may reach the southern Florida coastline , a top coast guard official has told the US Senate . Any oil that does wash up is likely to be in the form of tarballs which are a `` little easier to manage '' , Rear Adm Peter Neffenger said in testimony . Reports from the White House say a presidential commission will be set up to investigate the disaster . And a top official who oversaw offshore drilling has announced he is retiring . Chris Oynes said he would step down at the end of this month 
ret ==  US President Barack Obama to set up oil spill panel Mr Obama 's announcement on the panel is expected in the coming days US President Barack Obama will set up a commission to investigate the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , officials say . They say the panel will also examine industry practices and the government 's role in the disaster . Federal officials including Interior Secretary Ken Salazar are to face questioning by senators later . Meanwhile , tarballs found off Florida 's Key West are being tested to see if they come from the spill . Scientists fear it could travel up the east coast 
ret ==  BP to make decision on ` top kill ' plan to stem oil leak Underwater video shows tests on the seabed ahead of a plan to plug the leak The oil company BP is to decide on whether to carry out a new plan to try to stem the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , the chief executive has said . Tony Hayward said the procedure would begin on Wednesday if considered safe . Teams have been carrying out diagnostic tests to ensure the `` top kill '' method is feasible and will not backfire . The government has approved the measure . Meanwhile , a congressional memo has revealed there were several warning signs shortly before the rig exploded 
ret ==  Gulf oil spill : BP says ` top kill ' plug going to plan BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles : `` We have the best people working on this . '' BP says its operation to pump mud into a breached Gulf of Mexico oil well to try to stem the flow of oil caused by a rig explosion is going to plan . The US government is backing the `` top kill '' procedure , which has never been tried at such a depth . BP is under intense pressure to succeed after previous attempts to stem the leak failed . President Obama is expected to announce tough new drilling regulations after a key report into the spill is released 
ret ==  Oil spill is worst in US history The oil spill off the coast of America is now the worst in US history . Oil company BP 's latest operation to stop the leak is continuing . Mud is being fired into the broken pipe to try to plug it up . It 'll be a while before we know whether the muddy plan has worked , but BP says things are `` going to plan '' so far . US President Barack Obama is making his second visit to the site of the leak 
ret ==  UK doubles drilling rig inspections after US oil spill Mr Huhne expressed sympathy for those killed and those affected by the oil spill Britain is doubling inspection of drilling rigs after the BP oil spill , Energy Secretary Chris Huhne has said . He told MPs a review of standards had been carried out but with the beginning of exploration in deeper waters west of Shetland , `` we must be vigilant '' . Following the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster , UK regulation had been `` significantly tightened '' , he said . US President Barack Obama likened the spill 's impact to the way the 9\/11 attacks shaped US security policy . Mr Huhne told MPs an `` urgent review '' of oil and gas industry standards had already been undertaken 
ret ==  Mexicans still haunted by 1979 Ixtoc spill By Julian Miglierini BBC News , Campeche , Mexico The Ixtoc well was drilling at 150ft compared with Deepwater Horizon at 5,000 ft If the worried inhabitants of the southern coast of the US wonder what long-term effects the BP oil spill will have on their livelihoods and the environment , they could come to the Mexican state of Campeche to find answers . An explosion in 1979 at the Ixtoc I platform , located 80km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- off Mexico 's Gulf Coast , caused the largest ever peacetime oil spill . It took Pemex , Mexico 's state-owned oil company , more than nine months to stop the leak , during which time almost 3.3 million barrels of oil had gushed into the sea . It traveled as far as the Texas shoreline 
ret ==  Just how sharply have the estimates changed ? US scientists issued a figure of 35,000-60 ,000 barrels -LRB- 1.5-2 .5 million gallons -RRB- per day on 15 June . The figure was accepted by US Energy Secretary Steven Chu as `` a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil '' . By contrast , an estimate announced by US officials on 26 April put the flow at just 1,000 barrels per day 
ret ==  Kevin Costner helps clean up oil spill The water will be 99 % clean of crude oil after the separation process Film star Kevin Costner is to play a part in cleaning up the oil spill off the Gulf of Mexico . BP says they will be using 32 oil separation machines owned by Costner 's company to clean up the water . Costner invested $ 20m -LRB- # 13.46 m -RRB- developing the machines , which can clean up to 210,000 gallons of oily water a day . `` I did n't come here to save the day , '' Costner told reporters 
ret ==  Oil covered brown pelicans found off the Louisiana coast and affected by the most recent oil spill - BP Deepwater Horizon The recent oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has left many asking - how long will the pollution be felt ? In Cornwall we are only too aware of how oil spills can disrupt lives for years and years after they happen . In 1967 the Torrey Canyon was shipwrecked while trying to take a short cut between Cornwall and Scilly , when 36 million gallons of crude oil was spilt . Some people still say oil from the disaster is still washed up on our shores to this day . It remains Britain 's worst oil spill . Certainly there were huge problems for wildlife but as BBC Radio Cornwall 's Denis Nightingale reports , few blame those problems on the oil itself

He has permission to board the RV -LRB- research vessel -RRB- Cape Hatteras , a science ship , owned by the US National Science Foundation , run by Duke University & the University of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium . The ship is orbiting the nucleus of activity at the site of the oil spill , held at a distance of five nautical miles . The ship has been modified to meet the needs of the scientists studying this leak Researchers Professor David Valentine from University of California in Santa Barbara and Professor John Kessler of Texas A & M University are onboard for a 10 day cruise hoping to answer some basic questions about how much crude is flowing and where it s going . Although usually referred to as an oil spill , the leak is made up of over 40 % natural gas mostly methane , propane and ethane 
ret ==  In the Gulf of Mexico , oil continues to hemorrhage from a deep sea well nearly a mile beneath the ocean and about forty miles off the US coast . Although estimates vary , the growing consensus among scientists is that even with the cap that has now been placed over the leak , some 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day of crude oil are continuing to flow into the waters of the Gulf . Latest estimates suggest that some 3m barrels of oil have already entered the seas since the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk on April 20 . Parts of Caribbean at risk So far it has been the US that has suffered , but as the hurricane season gets underway and ocean currents undergo seasonal changes , there is a slight but hard to predict possibility that if the flow is not stopped in August when relief wells being drilled by BP are expected to be complete , some parts of the Western Caribbean could also be at risk . The Caribbean islands might be affected us the leak is not contained Forecasting hurricane frequency , intensity and tracking is a far from exact science ; but the suggestion this year is that higher than average sea temperatures in the Caribbean Sea may result in greater activity and intensity and for hurricanes to form off the southeast coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico , or in the northeastern Caribbean 
ret ==  BP can keep oil cap closed for another day , says Allen Admiral Paul Zukunft , US Coast Guard : `` There is no new oil coming up at the source '' BP is being allowed to keep the cap on its damaged well shut for another 24 hours , says the US official in charge of the Gulf of Mexico oil clean-up . In a letter to BP , Adm Thad Allen expressed concern about a `` detected seep '' on the sea floor near the well and other `` undetermined anomalies '' . The firm has pledged to monitor the sea floor for signs of a new leak closely . On Monday , Coast Guard Adm Paul Zukunft said : `` We 've had no indication of oil being released at the site . '' BP has noted that seepage can be a natural phenomenon

Fisheries were closed and the local economy was undermined . Many said such a disaster should never again befall American coastal communities 
ret ==  By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent , BBC News A study of the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill has confirmed the presence of a toxic chemical residue one kilometre below the sea surface . The investigation , carried out in June , shows a plume of crude oil-based chemicals up to 200m high and 2km wide , extending 35km from the spill site . The results are published in the journal Science . There had already been speculation that large quantities of oil from the spill remained dissolved in the sea at depth . This new research confirms that a plume , or cloud , does indeed exist below the surface 
ret ==  BP 's Gulf of Mexico oil well to be sealed ` by Sunday ' Adm Thad Allen says the well should be sealed within 96 hours BP 's ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be permanently sealed by Sunday . Adm Thad Allen , in charge of cleaning up the oil spill , has said a relief well , which has taken more than four months to drill , should intersect the damaged well later on Thursday . A mixture of mud and cement will then be pumped in , permanently sealing it . On Wednesday , the US said it would require oil firms to plug 3,500 non-producing Gulf of Mexico oil wells . `` We are within a 96-hour window of killing the well , '' former Coast Guard chief Adm Allen told reporters

The well poured millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before being capped , three months after blowing open . The news came as a committee of UK MPs raised `` serious doubts '' about Britain 's ability to combat oil spills from deep sea rigs . David Shukman went to see two of the `` top hats '' used by BP in spills such as the Gulf leak , which could also be deployed in the North Sea . 
ret ==  The impact of the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . While oil company BP was trying to stop the oil leaking off the coast of America , the damage to the environment was getting worse and worse . At least 27 million litres of crude oil have flowed into the water since the pipe started leaking in April 2010 , threatening wildlife such as birds . There were a number of attempts to plug the leak . Presenters Sonali and Ricky find out more from Grahame Madge of the RSPB

ret ==  BBC Radio 4 's The Report To be present during the early sessions of the Congressional inquiries into the cause of the Deepwater Horizon explosion last month , was to get a sense that this is not a great time to be trading on the word `` British '' in Washington . The BP oil spill has cast US energy policy in a new light Congressmen were lining up to heap scorn on both BP 's response to the spill and its prior safety record in the United States . Although BP has not been called British Petroleum for the best part of a decade , it has become fashionable for administration officials and congressmen to refer to it pointedly by its former name . But despite the ill-feeling directed towards Britain 's biggest company , the more resounding lesson to come from the catastrophe could be for the United States and its relationship with its offshore oil industry . `` The United States uses 25 % of the world 's oil , yet we only have 3 % of those reserves in the United States , '' House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Henry Waxman told the BBC

At least 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons -RRB- are leaking into the Gulf every day . What should be the new strategy to stem the oil flow ? Are you in the region ?

ret ==  Clare Spencer | 09:51 UK time , Friday , 28 May 2010 Commentators react to President Obama 's management of BP 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to President George W Bush Karl Rove argues in the Wall Street Journal that President Obama has been too slow to react : `` Since the Deepwater Horizon rig blew up on April 20 , a lethargic Team Obama has delayed or blown off key decisions requested by state and local governments and left British Petroleum in charge of developing a plan to cap the massive leak . Now the slow-moving oil spill threatens Mr. Obama 's reputation , along with 40 % of America 's sensitive wetlands . Critics include some of his most ardent cheerleaders , who understand that 38 days without an administration solution is unacceptable 
ret ==  Robert Peston | 15:39 UK time , Tuesday , 1 June 2010 Given that BP is a core holding of most British pension funds , that 's tens of billions of pounds off the wealth of millions of British people saving for a pension . And with BP dividends representing around 8 % of all income going into those pension funds -LRB- and a considerably higher proportion of all corporate dividends received by those funds -RRB- , if BP 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico causes collateral damage to its dividend-paying capacity , well , many of us will be feeling a bit poorer . As I 've written here before , it 's certainly not ludicrous to assume that the final cost for BP of this mess could wipe out at least an entire year 's profit -LRB- which for the past three years was just over # 13bn on average -RRB- - once compensation and possible fines have been paid . Perhaps more damagingly , the debacle is doing considerable harm to the value of its brand in the US - with what looks like every US citizen , from President Obama down , equating BP with the sullying of one of America 's most cherished coastlines . The talk among BP oil executives is that the company 's reputation in the US may have been so tarnished that the board will conclude that an orderly withdrawal from America - with the sale of its massive US assets - may be necessary -LRB- it 's widely thought , for example , that Chevron would be an enthusiastic buyer of those assets -RRB-

Well , that is how the US multinational Union Carbide Corporation , now owned by Dow Chemical , has behaved since it created the world 's worst industrial disaster at Bhopal in central India . The difference between BP and Union Carbide is not just a matter of the location of the disaster , although it is plainly that too . It is also down to the fact that successive national and state governments in India have rolled over time and time again to the realpolitik of dealing with Dow Chemical 's other investments in India .

The oil giant has shelled out an undisclosed amount of money to purchase relevant phrases like `` oil spill '' and `` oil disaster '' to ensure its site dealing with America 's biggest environmental catastrophe floats to the top of the search page ahead of millions of other results . There is nothing sinister about the effort says BP , claiming the move aims to `` assist those who are most impacted and help them find the right forms and the right people quickly and effectively .

ret ==  12:13 UK time , Thursday , 10 June 2010 Mr Obama 's blunt criticism of BP over the spill has prompted accusations of `` anti-British '' language . He has often referred to BP as `` British Petroleum '' when discussing the disastrous oil leak , even though the company has not used this name since 1998 . Although BP was founded as a British company and has a British boss in Tony Hayward , BP is very much a global company : it 's 44 % owned in the UK , split largely between 33 institutions and seven large individual investors . US investors own 39 % of the company , including 25 institutional and 14 big individual investors . Is the US using the British history of BP for political motives ? Has the oil spill made you think differently about Britain ? Does the history of a multi-national matter ? How should Britain respond ? This debate is now closed 
ret ==  Clare Spencer | 09:26 UK time , Friday , 11 June 2010 Commentators discuss BP 's oil spill and how it is affecting US-UK relations . The Daily Mail editorial expresses disappointment that David Cameron did n't stick up for BP : `` And now surely it 's time for Mr Cameron to tell some of these truths to President Obama , in defense of BP , a vital British company that has been systematically sabotaged by a petty and vengeful American government . '' The Telegraph editorial argues that Mr Cameron needs to be firm with Mr Obama when he talks to him this weekend : `` In his conversation with the President , Mr Cameron needs to make clear that the long-term financial well-being of BP is crucial to the economies of both Britain and the US . Despite Mr Obama 's insistence on associating BP with Britain , it is a multinational company , 40 per cent of whose shareholders are American . Mr Obama is beginning to sound stridently anti-business and anti-oil , neither of which can be in the economic interest of his own country , let alone ours 
ret ==  Host | 12:20 UK time , Monday , 14 June 2010 Commentators reflect on the implications of the BP oil spill for British pensions , multinational companies and the Obama presidency . In the Observer , Ruth Sunderland reflects on BP 's involvement in British pensions and anticipates an increase in shareholder power : `` The average pension fund member is not an expert on finance , oil extraction or fund management . The system here , as in the US , relies on large shareholders to police boardroom behavior and risk-taking . We now know how utterly they have failed in that duty . Most institutions are strangely timid about confrontations with company managements , despite the billions of pounds under their control

This is Rivers State , an area abundant in oil and gas . Environmentalists call the Delta the global capital of oil pollution , but unlike the Gulf of Mexico , there are no underwater robots , flotillas of scientists or oil booms here . On 12 May 2009 , Shell 's Bomo manifold blew up , leaking massive amounts of crude . Local people say 39 hectares were contaminated

ret ==  By Jamie Robertson Presenter , BBC World News With its chief executive under fire during his appearence before US lawmakers this week , it ca n't be that much of a surprise that BP has lost its position , with its share price down by more than a third . Shell has taken its place , which has a certain irony since BP overtook Shell as Europe 's largest oil company just before the Gulf oil spill . BP was cutting costs faster and more aggressively and reaping the rewards . All that is rather academic now , and Shell 's investors are the happier bunch : for starters , they have a dividend , and they do n't have an oil spill . However , it is worth remembering that Shell is the second largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico , and although it and the other `` Big Oil '' brethren swear blind that the Gulf spill would never have happened on one of their rigs , offshore drilling could face serious obstacles 
ret ==  BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward has been under fire The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been made worse for BP by the public-relation gaffes of those in charge of the company . A few misplaced words can cause a lot of damage , so why are they getting them so wrong ? There 's a chronic foot-in-mouth outbreak at BP and it does n't look like it will be clearing up anytime soon . Chief executive Tony Hayward has already been dubbed `` wayward Hayward '' by the media for his gaffes when speaking about the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Even when he says very little , he gets it all wrong . Facing US politicians in Washington last week he was repeatedly criticised for dodging questions 
ret ==  President Barack Obama has labeled the spill America 's environmental 9\/11 . The failure of the blowout preventer - a critical piece of safety equipment - on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April means that up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day are gushing into the sea , wreaking havoc with the region 's delicate ecosystem . Hilary Andersson interviewed one worker on the Deepwater Horizon who told her he identified a leak on a component of the blowout preventer weeks before the explosion . The explosion killed 11 workers and injured many more . That worker is now suing both BP and the rig 's owners , Transocean , for negligence 
ret ==  By Laurence Knight Business reporter , BBC News BP want some way to draw a line under the Gulf of Mexico disaster and move on Things are not so bad now . BP 's share price - which had more than halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in April first triggered the company 's woes - has staged an impressive recovery in recent weeks . Yet talk continues to circulate of a possible strategic investor in BP - either as a welcome provider of fresh capital to the company , or an unwelcome opportunist sniffing a bargain . So what are the options now for BP ? On 16 June , the cost of buying financial protection for one year against a possible debt default by BP reached a staggering 10 % . I think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case 
ret ==  By Laura Trevelyan BBC News , New Orleans Laura Trevelyan describes the atmosphere at the commission Day one of the public hearings of the national commission into the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in New Orleans , and raw emotions were on display alongside the more tempered contributions . The many different reactions to the spill were there for all to see . This was the chance for the people of the Gulf Coast to give their reaction to what has happened , and finally , after a day of statements from officials and affected industries , it was the turn of those who had waited patiently . Not all managed to get that far . As the proceedings began , a man from Revolution newspaper stood up and denounced this as a capitalist oil spill 
ret ==  By Robyn Bresnahan BBC News Bob Shipp said BP wanted to hire his entire marine science department BP faces more than 300 lawsuits so far . In a statement , BP says it has hired more than a dozen national and local scientists `` with expertise in the resources of the Gulf of Mexico '' . The BBC has obtained a copy of a contract offered to scientists by BP . It says that scientists can not publish the research they do for BP or speak about the data for at least three years , or until the government gives the final approval to the company 's restoration plan for the whole of the Gulf . It also states scientists may perform research for other agencies as long as it does not conflict with the work they are doing for BP 
ret ==  Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg : BP still in ` grand shape ' despite record losses BP says it has set aside $ 32.2 bn -LRB- # 20.8 bn -RRB- to cover the costs linked to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The company said the charge gave it a loss of $ 17bn for the three months between April and June - a UK record . BP 's chairman said the costs estimate was based on the company 's belief that it was not grossly negligent , and added the bill could be higher 
ret ==  Clare Spencer | 09:55 UK time , Thursday , 6 January 2011 Commentators discuss the implications of a US report which concluded that BP cost-cutting is to blame for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . `` The report is likely to turn attention back to BP after several months in which the oil giant sought to turn the spotlight on its contractors . '' In The Times David Wighton says the report is unlikely to prove a critical obstacle to BP 's efforts to rebuild and minimize the costs of the disaster : `` The final report states that `` whether purposeful or not '' many of the decisions taken by BP , Halliburton and Transocean that increased risks did save time and therefore money . The conclusions will form an important part of the legal actions being pursued against BP , including that by the US Government . But they do not directly determine whether BP will be found guilty of gross negligence , which would increase the fines faced by the company by billions of dollars 
ret ==  Excerpts : BP oil spill report In an advance released chapter of its forthcoming final report , the US presidential National Oil Spill Commission found that the companies involved in the BP oil spill had made decisions to cut costs and save time , contributing to the disaster . Here are some key excerpts from their findings . The well blew out because a number of separate risk factors , oversights , and outright mistakes combined to overwhelm the safeguards meant to prevent just such an event from happening . But most of the mistakes and oversights at Macondo -LRB- well -RRB- can be traced back to a single overarching failure - a failure of management . Better management by BP , Halliburton , and Transocean would almost certainly have prevented the blowout by improving the ability of individuals involved to identify the risks they faced , and to properly evaluate , communicate , and address them 
ret ==  John Curry , from BP , explains how the funnel should work A giant iron funnel being built in a bid to halt the huge spill from a Gulf of Mexico well will be deployed to the seabed on Thursday , BP says . The 98-tonne , dome-topped box being built by steel workers will be connected to a drill ship and lowered to the sea floor . BP has never deployed such a structure at a depth of 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- and difficulties may occur , it says . `` There 's no guarantees , '' BP boss Tony Hayward told AP news agency . `` We 'll undoubtedly encounter some issues as we go through that process

ret ==  Oceanographer Simon Boxall explains how the funnel will work A ship carrying a giant metal containment box has arrived at the site where a sunken oil rig has been leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico . Oil giant BP says it hopes the 90-tonne device will help to contain the oil . The US is to carry out a controlled burn of some of the leaked oil . But the oil reached a beach for the first time on Thursday , officials confirmed . The spill was set off by an explosion that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig off Louisiana last month 
ret ==  BP is trying to funnel the leaking oil to the surface The deadly blast on board an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was caused by an exploding bubble of methane gas , according to a US media report . Workers on the rig described hearing `` screaming and hollering '' and said people leapt into the sea to escape . The accounts came from a BP report into last month 's blast , which has led to thousands of barrels of oil leaking . Eye-witnesses also said that safety mechanisms did not function and that workers were taken by surprise . The fresh details about the blast were revealed in interviews with oil rig workers carried out by BP during an internal investigation , Associated Press reports 
ret ==  More than 160 miles -LRB- 257km -RRB- of protective booms had been deployed The oil company , BP , has encountered problems with the containment device it is trying to put over a blown-out well on the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico . Chief operating officer Doug Suttles said the 98-tonne concrete-and-steel box had to be moved , after ice-like crystals began accumulating inside it . He said BP 's engineers hoped they could find a solution to the problem . The aim is to contain as much as 85 % of the escaping oil and then funnel it into a waiting tanker on the surface . US officials have closed the Breton National Wildlife Refuge to the public after the slick caused by the leak reached islands off Louisiana

The so-called top hat dome could be in place within 72 hours , chief executive Tony Hayward said . The latest bid to plug the gushing well comes after previous attempts to stem the flow failed . A growing slick from the BP-leased rig is threatening an environmental disaster along US coasts . The top hat dome could be in place within 72 hours , Mr Hayward told a press conference in Houston , Texas , on Monday 
ret ==  Hundreds of miles of booms are being laid along the coastline BP officials desperate to stem a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are considering stuffing the well with golf balls and tyres , it was revealed . BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the so-called `` junk shot '' of debris was one option after previous attempts to stem the flow failed . A growing slick from the BP-leased rig is threatening an environmental disaster along US coasts . Some 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day are flowing into the sea . Mr Suttles said it may be possible to stem the flow by blocking the well 's failed blowout preventer 
ret ==  Booms are being used against the oil off Louisiana Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the British company had missed `` deadline after deadline '' in its efforts to seal a blown-out oil well . But he said BP had agreed to pay clean-up costs beyond the current US $ 75m -LRB- # 52m -RRB- liability limit . Mr Salazar is due to visit the disaster site on Monday with other officials . The oil leak began more than a month ago , when a drilling rig operated on behalf of BP exploded , killing 11 people . Tens of thousands of barrels of oil have spewed into the ocean since then from the well 's ruptured riser pipe , 1,524 m -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- beneath the surface The spill has reached Louisiana and is threatening Florida and Cuba 
ret ==  There is increasing anger in local communities at the failures The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is the worst environmental disaster the US has faced , a senior official has said . White House energy adviser Carol Browner also said the US was `` prepared for the worst scenario '' that the leak might not be stopped before August . BP is to try a new tactic after its latest failure to halt the leak , but says there is no guarantee of success . BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said even if it worked it would only halt a majority of the spill . At least 20 million gallons have now spilled into the Gulf of Mexico , affecting more than 70 miles -LRB- 110km -RRB- of Louisiana 's coastline

ret ==  Firefighters battled in vain to save the rig The Deepwater Horizon rig disaster caused the deaths of 11 crew and a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Since the 20 April catastrophe there has been much discussion in US Congressional hearings and the media about the sequence of events that led up to it . Here is a summary of what we know so far about the BP oil spill , and the primary questions that are still being investigated . The Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling an oil well in the Macondo prospect that was intended to be plugged with cement and then completed later to become a production well . The top of the well was about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,524 m -RRB- beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico 
ret ==  The escaping oil volume was calculated by studying high-resolution video clips US scientists who have analyzed videos of the oil gushing from the Deepwater Horizon well say about 4.4 million barrels of crude escaped into the Gulf . This new figure is in good agreement with calculations produced by federal government advisers who used different estimation techniques . The Columbia University team reports its findings to the journal Science . They indicate the volume leaking from the well at one stage could have filled four Olympic-sized pools every day

In addition to these comments , his officials have begun referring to `` British Petroleum '' - a name the company has not used since 1998 . With UK industry increasingly uneasy at what they feel are attempts to label Britain as the villain , the blame game risks turning into a diplomatic row . Sir Christopher Meyer , former British ambassador to the US , told the BBC that the issue had become `` a bit of a crisis , politically '' for the American and UK governments . Miles Templeman , director general of the Institute of Directors , said that some of the language being used by the Obama administration was simply `` inappropriate ''

But when he speaks to Barack Obama this weekend , in a scheduled phone call , the prime minister will be acutely aware of the growing clamor for him to speak up for Britain . Several newspapers , a former Conservative party chairman , Lord Tebbit , and the present Conservative London mayor , Boris Johnson , are all up in arms at the perceived Britain-bashing by the US president . Headlines such as the Daily Mail 's `` Stand Up For Your Country , Mr Cameron '' and its allegations of `` cynical '' attacks by Mr Obama on Britain 's `` flagship company '' capture the mood in sections of the British press and Tory party . Mr Obama 's pithy pledge of finding ass to kick over the environmental disaster , and his pointed references to `` British Petroleum '' , a corporate identity BP has not used in years , have undoubtedly fuelled the impression of deliberate anti-British rhetoric

Rear Adm James Watson gave the oil firm 48 hours to identify `` additional leak containment capacity '' . The warning follows new US government data suggesting the flow of oil could be double previous estimates . Speaking to UK PM David Cameron by phone , President Barack Obama said his criticism of BP was not anti-British . In a letter to the oil firm , Rear Adm Watson said : `` Because those estimates have now been revised and estimate a substantially higher flow of oil from the Macado 252 well , it is clear that additional capacity is urgently needed 
ret ==  By Ross Hawkins Political correspondent , BBC News Mr Cameron spent 30 minutes on the phone to President Obama Government ministers have been careful not to get drawn into a debate about Barack Obama 's comments on BP . In the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg - they did not want to allow the issue to spiral into a `` tit for tat political diplomatic spat '' . It is hardly surprising they saved the discussions for a weekend phone call between David Cameron and the president . The question is : what exactly was said in that call ? Different points were emphasised by different sources . Downing Street 's account had the president saying frustrations about the oil spill had nothing to do with national identity , and making clear he had no interest in undermining BP 's value 
ret ==  Oil has been leaking into the Gulf since 20 April Barack Obama has told Prime Minister David Cameron that criticism of BP over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has `` nothing to do with national identity '' . In a 30-minute phone call , the US president said he recognized BP was a multinational company and he had no interest in undermining its value . Mr Obama 's blunt criticism of BP over the spill has prompted accusations of `` anti-British '' language . Mr Cameron will visit the US as prime minister for the first time on 20 July . During the telephone conversation on Saturday , Mr Cameron expressed his sadness at the environmental damage from the oil leak that began on 20 April 
ret ==  BP oil spill : Obama comments ` not anti-British ' Barack Obama said he would have fired BP 's boss had he run the company Obama administration officials have used the old name `` British Petroleum '' when making criticisms of the firm - sparking controversy in the UK . US ambassador Louis Susman said Mr Obama had used `` British Petroleum '' perhaps once , but was keen to say `` BP '' . The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Mexican Gulf on 20 April , killing 11 workers and creating a huge leak . Mr Obama has said he would have fired BP 's top executive Tony Hayward if he were in charge of the company and has supported the idea that it suspend its quarterly dividend for shareholders . His comments have provoked anger among many business people and pensioners in the UK , many of whose pension funds have investments in the oil giant 
ret ==  BP bosses hold Obama crisis talks The White House meeting was the first between the president and BP BP executives have met US President Barack Obama at the White House after he vowed to make the oil company pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . In his first Oval Office address to the US as president , Mr Obama said he would tell BP 's chairman the firm must set up a fund to compensate those affected . Oil has been leaking into the Gulf since a drilling rig leased by BP blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers . BP has been accused of failing to follow proper procedures . As oil has washed ashore in Gulf coast states , affecting businesses and wildlife , the rhetoric from US politicians has become increasingly bitter and the firm 's share price has tumbled , with billions of dollars being wiped off its value 
ret ==  Obama vows to ` make BP pay ' for oil spill damage President Obama : `` We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused '' President Barack Obama has vowed to `` make BP pay '' for damage caused by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , in his first national address from the Oval Office . Mr Obama said he would meet company executives later and tell them that they must set up a fund to compensate those affected by the spill . He described the spill as an assault on the shores and citizens of the US that tested the limits of human technology . And he said it demonstrated the need to end the US `` addiction '' to fossil fuels . Hours after the government sharply increased its estimate of how much oil was flowing into the Gulf from the broken well , Mr Obama warned that the risks of another such incident would continue to rise because `` we 're running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water '' 
ret ==  BP has faced mounting criticism for its handling of the crisis BP has denied claims by one of its partners that its handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill amounted to `` gross negligence '' . BP said it `` strongly disagrees '' with Anadarko Petroleum , who said BP 's behavior in the run-up to the disaster was `` reckless '' . Anadarko , the largest independent oil and gas company operating in the Gulf , owns 25 % of the well . The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , killing 11 workers . BP has faced mounting criticism for its handling of what has become the worst environmental disaster in US history , as the leak continues to spread despite efforts to contain it 
ret ==  London Olympics chairman Lord Coe has said the Gulf of Mexico oil spill will not harm BP 's sponsorship of the 2012 Games . He said the oil giant was a `` trusted partner '' , adding the spill `` does not make a difference to us at all '' . Lord Coe and BP regional vice president Peter Mather were attending an event to promote the London 2012 Cultural Weekend , which takes place in July . BP is a top tier sponsor of the 2012 Games . Lord Coe said : `` They -LRB- BP -RRB- were with us during the bid and now they are with us as partners doing the delivery phase 
ret ==  Representatives of BP , Transocean and Halliburton speak to senators Oil executives have traded blame in Congress over the Gulf Coast oil spill , as the battle to contain it continues . British oil giant BP told a Senate hearing a crucial safety device used by drilling contractor Transocean failed . Senators heard Transocean argue in turn that BP had been in charge and that a third firm , a BP contractor , did not plug the exploratory well properly . President Barack Obama was said by the White House to be `` deeply frustrated '' the oil leak had yet to be stopped . The Obama administration has announced a break-up of the federal oil industry watchdog amid fears of a conflict of interest 
ret ==  By Hilary Andersson BBC Panorama , Washington Tyrone Benton : ` We saw a leak ' A Deepwater Horizon rig worker has told the BBC that he identified a leak in the oil rig 's safety equipment weeks before the explosion . Tyrone Benton said the leak was not fixed at the time , but that instead the faulty device was shut down and a second one relied on . BP said rig owners Transocean were responsible for the operation and maintenance of that piece of equipment . Transocean said it tested the device successfully before the accident . Meanwhile , BP has said that its costs in tackling the disaster have now risen to $ 2bn -LRB- # 1
ret ==  BP said Transocean 's allegations are misguided and misleading Energy giant BP has been accused of hiding key data needed to investigate the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster . Transocean , the company that owned the oil rig , alleged that BP is refusing to hand over information it needs about the explosion . The claim is made in a letter from one of Transocean 's lawyers sent to members of President Barack Obama 's cabinet . BP rejected the allegation , saying the letter contained `` misguided and misleading assertions '' . Nevertheless , the claim risks piling further pressure on BP , which has borne the brunt of political and public criticism for the disaster on 20 April which killed 11 workers and caused the worst oil spill in US history 
ret ==  BP spreads blame over oil spill Eleven people were killed and 17 people were injured in the explosion A `` sequence of failures involving a number of different parties '' was to blame for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , BP says . An investigation carried out by BP said it was responsible in part for the disaster , but it also blamed two other companies working on the well . However both firms criticised the report .

ret ==  BP faces backlash over Gulf oil spill report The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and injured 17 Drilling firm Transocean branded the report `` self serving '' while cement contractor Halliburton said it contained `` omissions and inaccuracies '' . BP blamed a `` sequence of failures involving a number of different parties '' for the spill . It faces billions of dollars worth of compensation claims over the disaster . Transocean dismissed BP 's report , accusing the oil giant of having designed a `` fatally flawed '' well and making `` cost-saving decisions that increased risk - in some cases , severely '' . `` This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo -LRB- well -RRB- incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design , '' the Swiss-based group said in a statement 
ret ==  Who 's blamed by BP for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill ? At the time of the explosion , 126 crew members were on the rig , 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana BP has revealed a number of key findings made during its internal investigation into who it believes was responsible for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Eleven people were killed and 17 people were injured in an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon on 20 April . An estimated 4.9 m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf after the blast . The report says no one action or inaction was behind the accident 
ret ==  BP oil disaster : Pre-spill tests ` showed cement flaw ' The blowout caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers Cement used to seal the Macondo well may have contributed to the blowout that caused the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , US investigators have found . Both BP , which owned the well , and Halliburton , the contractor responsible for the cement , were aware of tests showing it was unstable , they said . Halliburton has denied the claims , saying the tests were invalid as they were on a different kind of cement . The 20 April blowout led to the worst environmental disaster in US history . Eleven workers on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig were killed by an explosion which followed , and hundreds of miles of coast were polluted 
ret ==  During a presentation to the oil spill commission , the panel 's chief investigator said he agreed with 90 % of BP 's conclusions about the disaster . But the panel 's preliminary report said some BP actions had led to extra risks . BP has been widely criticised since the 20 April blowout in the Gulf of Mexico . The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11 workers , polluted hundreds of miles of coast and led to the worst environmental disaster in US history . Fred Bartlit challenged congressional claims during his presentation to the seven-member National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , countering allegations that BP had made disastrous choices to save millions of dollars 
ret ==  Gulf oil spill : President 's panel says firms complacent Mr Reilly , shown at Monday 's meeting , cited a `` rush to completion '' of the well Three major companies involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill lacked a safety culture and made serious mistakes ahead of the catastrophe , the key inquiry into the disaster has said . The White House oil spill commission said there was a culture of complacency at BP , Transocean and Halliburton . `` There was not a culture of safety on that rig , '' co-chair Bill Reilly said . The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11 workers and polluted hundreds of miles of coast . Mr Reilly called for `` top-to-bottom reform '' at the companies involved in the well , known as the Macondo well , and faulted a `` sweep of bad decisions '' by the three companies 
ret ==  US oil spill : ` Bad management ' led to BP disaster BP said it would try to ensure the lessons learned from the spill improved deepwater drilling operations The companies involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill made decisions to cut costs and save time that contributed to the disaster , a US panel has concluded . In a chapter of its final report , to be published next week , the presidential commission said the failures were `` systemic '' and likely to recur . BP did not have adequate controls in place to ensure safety , it found . The April blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 people and caused one of the worst oil spills in history . The Macondo well , about a mile under the sea 's surface , eventually leaked millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , damaging hundreds of miles of coastline before it was capped in July 
ret ==  The Deepwater Horizon rig explosion led to the worst environmental catastrophe in US history A committee of MPs has raised `` serious doubts '' about the UK 's ability to combat oil spills from deep sea rigs following the BP Gulf of Mexico oil disaster last year . They also warned that taxpayers could pay for a major spill in the North Sea . But they said a moratorium on deep sea drilling would undermine the UK 's energy security and is unnecessary . Energy Minister Charles Hendry `` welcomed '' the report and said he would consider its recommendations in detail . The report came as a US presidential commission found that decisions to cut costs and save time had contributed to last year 's BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico 
ret ==  Gulf of Mexico oil spill : Panel urges major reforms The Deepwater Horizon disaster caused one of the worst oil spills in history The report comes from a US presidential commission investigating the spill . The panel also said the US needed to expand and update drilling regulation and establish an independent drilling safety agency . The April blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 people and caused one of the worst oil spills in history . The Macondo well , about a mile under the sea 's surface , eventually leaked millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf , damaging hundreds of miles of coastline before it was capped in July . The findings came in the final report of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , which President Barack Obama convened in May to investigate the root causes of the spill and recommend changes to industry and government policy 
ret ==  BP said there was a ` massive effort ' to control the leak BP has admitted full responsibility for cleaning up the spill . It has refused to accept blame for the accident , however , as the failed equipment that caused the explosion was owned and operated by drilling firm Transocean . By mid-afternoon , BP shares closed down 3 % lower at 558.5 p. Transocean shares also continued to fall , down 3
ret ==  Shares in BP fell 3.5 % in early trading , following the announcement of a criminal investigation into the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster in the US . But shares later fully recovered , closing just a quarter of a penny down , as markets rallied in the afternoon . Investors remain concerned over the impact that further litigation could have on the British oil giant 's finances and reputation . There are also fears that shareholders could see their dividend cut 
ret ==  BP will not make a decision on its next dividend payment until late July , chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has said . `` The first priority is to do what is right in the Gulf of Mexico , '' Mr Svanberg said , answering an investor 's question on a conference call . The comment came amid US pressure on BP to cut its dividend to help pay for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . He also gave chief executive Tony Hayward the board 's full support , after criticism of his handling of the spill . Before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began , the company had been expected to pay out $ 10

ret ==  By Richard Anderson Business reporter , BBC News BP has suffered a number of controversies in recent years It 's not often that a US president has cause to declare that , given the chance , he would sack the boss of one of the UK 's leading companies . But that is precisely what Barack Obama said he would do on Tuesday , prompted by what he considers to be a series of misjudged comments by BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward following the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . And it 's a view shared by many critics , some of whom are BP shareholders , unimpressed by Mr Hayward declaring that he `` just wants his life back '' and that the Gulf is a `` big ocean '' . Such comments have simply served to damage further BP 's already battered reputation in the US and fuel anti-BP anger among many Americans , particularly those directly affected by the spill in Louisiana and beyond . To accusations of negligence and incompetence can now be added charges of indifference in the minds of those incensed by the scale of the spill and the time it has taken for BP to stem the flow of oil 
ret ==  BP has seen its shares fall by 9 % - as its directors discussed whether to suspend dividends to shareholders . The firm is under intense pressure from the US government , which wants BP to use the money to pay for the Gulf of Mexico clean-up . The cost of cleaning up the spillage has risen to $ 1.6 bn -LRB- # 1.1 bn -RRB- 
ret ==  The clean-up costs are mounting for BP BP has said the cost of cleaning up the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico has now reached $ 2.65 bn -LRB- # 1.76 bn -RRB- . The oil giant said this included the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to Gulf states and claims paid . The total has risen to an average of $ 100m a day over the past three days - the highest daily average so far 
ret ==  There are now more than 44,000 people working on the operation The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has so far cost BP a total of $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- , the company has said . The total includes the cost of containing the spill and cleaning up the oil , and the cost of drilling relief wells . It also includes the $ 147m paid out in compensation to some of those affected by the spill . But BP again warned that the total cost of the spill is likely to be much higher 
ret ==  BP began drilling two relief wells in May BP says its operation to drill a relief well to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil leak is `` slightly ahead of schedule '' . A spokeswoman for the company told the BBC it was `` ahead of the original schedule of completion in August '' . Asked about comments made by Bob Dudley , the man in charge , that finishing by 27 July was possible , she emphasised the caveats in what he said . Mr Dudley said completion between 20 and 27 July was possible but only `` in a perfect world with no interruptions '' . In his interview with the Wall Street Journal newspaper earlier this week , Mr Dudley added that such a `` perfect case '' was threatened by the hurricane season in the region and was `` unlikely '' 
ret ==  BP shares rise on rumors of possible asset sales The cost of containing the oil spill now stands at $ 3.5 bn -LRB- # 2.3 bn -RRB- . BP shares have risen sharply on speculation it may have buyers lined up for possible asset sales . The UK oil firm is thought to be planning the sell-offs in order to fund cost of the Gulf of Mexico clean-up , which has now reached $ 3
ret ==  Shares in BP have closed down nearly 5 % in London amid uncertainty over the success of its latest attempts to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil leak . Earlier Thad Allen , the US official overseeing the oil clean-up , warned that BP may have to remove the cap on its damaged oil well . There are concerns that the cap is failing to prevent some oil leakage . BP 's shares ended the day at 389p , having risen from the 296p low reached at the end of June . But the share price is still less than 60 % of its level before the disaster began in April 
ret ==  Halliburton profits up despite oil spill Fallout from the US oil spill has not yet hit Halliburton profits Halliburton , services provicer for the energy industry , has announced a big jump in profits despite its involvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster . The Texas-based company said profits for the last three months rose by 83 % compared with last year . Halliburton 's share price rose as much as 5 % in early trading on Wall Street . It said the US suspension of deepwater drilling is expected to hit profits , but land-based oil and gas operations remained profitable . Halliburton was in charge of sealing BP 's Macondo oil well before it exploded in April 
ret ==  BP agrees $ 7bn -LRB- # 4.6 bn -RRB- asset sale to fund oil clean-up BP is likely to overshadow Prime Minister David Cameron 's visit to the US BP is to sell assets in Texas , Canada and Egypt , to part-fund the clean-up cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The oil giant said it had reached a $ 7bn -LRB- # 4.6 bn -RRB- deal with US-based oil production firm Apache Corp. 
ret ==  BP links staff bonuses to safety performance BP is taking steps to improve its image after the Gulf oil spill BP 's new boss Bob Dudley has told the company 's 80,000 employees that safety will be the sole measure for bonus payments in the fourth quarter . Mr Dudley said in an email that payments would be linked to `` reducing operational risks '' and `` excellent safety and compliance standards '' . Existing bonus arrangements would be honored for the first nine months of the year , he added . BP is struggling to repair its image following the Gulf oil spill disaster . `` We are taking this step in order to be absolutely clear that safety , compliance and operational risk management is BP 's number one priority , well ahead of all other priorities , '' the email said 
ret ==  BP sells Gulf of Mexico oil field assets to Marubeni BP faces paying out billions of dollars to compensate victims of the oil spill BP has said it will sell its interests in four Gulf of Mexico oil fields to Japan 's Marubeni as part of its moves to pay for the oil spill there . The deal , which is subject to regulatory approval , is expected to raise $ 650m -LRB- # 413m -RRB- . BP is in the process of selling assets worth up to $ 30bn to meet clean-up and compensation costs . Last week , the company announced it would sell business interests in Vietnam and Venezuela for $ 1.8 bn 
ret ==  BP has changed its chief executive since the oil spill Oil giant BP has announced a return to profit in the three months to September after last quarter 's record loss . The firm said its replacement cost profit for the period was $ 1.85 bn -LRB- # 1.15 bn -RRB- , as against the $ 17bn loss recorded from April to June . The previous loss reflected the massive costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill crisis , which followed an explosion on a drilling rig in April 
ret ==  BP wrestles with oil spill hitch in Gulf of Mexico A relief well being drilled to stop the spill will not be finished for weeks Engineers from the British oil firm BP are scrambling to find a way to contain oil leaking from a blown-out well on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . A containment device lowered over the well to funnel oil to the surface had to be moved on Saturday after ice-like crystals began accumulating inside it . Some 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day has been flowing into the sea since an explosion on a rig last month . Balls of tar have meanwhile begun washing up on an island off Alabama . Bundles of absorbent material have been laid along the shore of Dauphin Island in an attempt to protect the resort area 
ret ==  Oil spill in Gulf of Mexico in maps and graphics A massive operation is under way in and around the Gulf of Mexico to halt a leak from a blown-out oil well and prevent the spread of the slick . The graphic above shows the scene 1,524 m -LRB- 5,000 feet -RRB- beneath the waves where oil is leaking out of the damaged remnants of the oil well apparatus . Below we explain the various attempts to stem the leak from the damaged oil lines on the sea bed . Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125-tonne , 18-metre -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor . However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice-like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy 
ret ==  Plan to cap Gulf of Mexico oil leak with dome delayed BP says the new dome should be working later on Thursday or Friday A new attempt by BP to control the main leak at the Gulf of Mexico oil well disaster site with a steel dome has been put back by a `` few days '' . Earlier , the British oil giant said it hoped the `` top hat '' , which is now on the seabed , would be deployed by Thursday at the broken pipeline . An attempt to use a larger containment dome failed on Sunday when it became clogged with ice and gas . The well is spewing out some 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day . The `` top hat '' is meant to siphon oil into container ships but there is no guarantee that the plan will work , the BBC 's Andy Gallacher reports 
ret ==  BP tries to thread tube into leaking pipe to stop flow Forecasters predict the slick will begin washing ashore in more states soon BP is using undersea robots in a bid to jam a tube into a broken pipe that is gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico . The attempt to divert the oil flow came as workers readied a so-called `` top hat '' containment dome to be lowered over the leak . Some scientists have significantly raised their estimate of the rate of oil flow , as the surface slick has grown to 3,650 sq miles -LRB- 9,500 sq km -RRB- . Several US senators have proposed a ban on drilling off the Pacific coast . Five thousand feet -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- below the surface on Friday , remote-controlled robots were attempting to thread a six-inch -LRB- 15cm -RRB- tube surrounded by a stopper into the 21-inch pipe spewing crude oil and natural gas at a high rate into the water 
ret ==  US demands oil spill costs ` clarification ' from BP Thousands of barrels of oil a day have been leaking from the seabed The US government has demanded immediate clarification from BP over its commitment to pay for costs caused by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The Obama administration said it wanted to be sure BP would honor commitments not to limit payments for damages to a US statutory cap of $ 75m -LRB- # 50m -RRB- . Meanwhile , BP says oil dispersants applied at the source of the leak on Friday have begun to take effect . Mississippi has become the third US state to have oil wash up on its coast . Crude has already contaminated beaches in Louisiana and Alabama since a drilling rig blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers 
ret ==  BP has tried a number of methods to shut down the leak from the damaged oil well - often innovating as subsequent attempts have failed . Although some of the methods have been tried and tested at incidents elsewhere in the world , they have not been carried out at such great depth as the Deepwater Horizon leak - 5,000 feet -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the surface . 2 JUNE : LOWER MARINE RISER PACKAGE After the failure of the top kill procedure , BP attempts to cut the top off the upper section of the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and place a cap on it , sealing the leak and taking oil to a ship on the surface . After a brief setback with some of the cutting equipment , the cap is installed and BP announces on 4 June that it is collecting oil at a rate of 1,000 barrels a day 
ret ==  Thousands have submitted their ideas to BP We asked readers to submit their ideas on how the Gulf of Mexico oil spill should have been stopped . A selection of the hundreds we received has been assessed by Prof Iraj Ershaghi , director of petroleum engineering at the University of Southern California .

ret ==  US President Barack Obama has appointed Kenneth Feinberg to administer the $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- fund that BP has set up to compensate victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Mr Feinberg has experience in such matters : he ran the victims ' claim fund set up in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington . He has said he is not aligned with the government or BP and will administer the fund independently . Who will receive compensation from the fund ? The oil spill has caused disruption along the US Gulf Coast , affecting fishing and tourism and fouling some beaches and marshes 
ret ==  Kenneth Feinberg oversaw compensation for victims of the 11 September , 2001 attacks Independent administrator Kenneth Feinberg pledged swift action and said payments would be more generous than those that would be awarded by a court . But he said those seeking compensation must give up their right to sue BP . The fund is to reimburse Gulf of Mexico residents and businesses for lost wages and profits and for personal injuries and clean-up , among other claims . BP has already paid $ 368m in claims since the April spill . The oil spill , which began 20 April with the explosion of the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , caused widespread disruption along the US Gulf Coast 
ret ==  Kenneth Feinberg oversaw compensation for victims of the 11 September , 2001 attacks The administrator of a $ 20bn -LRB- # 12.5 bn -RRB- fund to compensate victims of the BP oil spill has said there is `` no doubt '' that fraudulent claims are an issue . Kenneth Feinberg pledged to be vigilant over who received payments to protect the integrity of the fund . About $ 1.3 bn has already been paid out in emergency payments

The companies involved in the BP oil spill made decisions to cut costs and save time that contributed to the disaster . In a 48-page report , the presidential commission wrote that the failures were `` systemic '' and likely to recur without industry and government reform . The BBC 's Iain Mackenzie said the report is `` incredibly critical '' of all of the companies involved . 
ret ==  6 January 2011 Last updated at 18:51 GMT Help The oil giant BP has been severely criticised in a major report into the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico last year . A report commissioned by President Obama has blamed bad management and cost cutting . It also found two other companies , Halliburton and Transocean to be at fault . BP says it has already introduced significant changes to improve safety . 
ret ==  Ben Sutherland | 09:43 UK time , Thursday , 6 January 2011 The final report into the Deepwater Horizon oil spill has said BP made decisions to cut costs and save time that contributed to the disaster - but that Haliburton and Transocean were also to blame . The report , by a US presidential panel , has said failures of BP were `` systemic '' - and were likely to happen again unless there were reforms in the oil industry . Perhaps most damningly , the chapter of the report detailing the circumstances of the actual explosion is headed with this quote from an internal BP email : `` But , who cares , it 's done , end of story , -LRB- we -RRB- will probably be fine and we 'll get a good cement job . '' However , from BP 's perspective , the key phrase in the report may be that the disaster was due to `` multiple causes and multiple companies . '' Certainly , it 's what they have emphasised in their reaction to the report 's findings 
ret ==  Case study : Gulf of Mexico oil spill and BP On 20 April 2010 a deepwater oil well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico . The immediate effect was that it killed 11 people and injured 17 others . Oil leaked at a high rate which is difficult to calculate . Some estimates are around 40,000 barrels a day . The oil spill posed risks to the environment and affected local industry

At the moment , the only completely accurate answer would appear to be : we do not know . For David Kennedy from the US National Ocean Service , it is `` a very very significant event , and of great concern '' . But Clifford Jones , an oil and gas engineering specialist from the UK 's Aberdeen University , suggests it should not be considered in the same category as the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 , with which it is regularly being compared . It is a threat to the ecosystem , he allows , but says the Exxon Valdez leaked significantly more oil than is likely to flow from the stricken Deepwater Horizons drillsite before pressure in the well drops and stops forcing the oil out .

The prediction this year for the Atlantic is for an `` active to extremely active '' hurricane season , which officially began on 1 June . According to the US 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , there is a 70 % chance of eight to 14 hurricanes , of which between three and seven could be major hurricanes with winds of more than 111mph -LRB- 179km\/h -RRB- . I 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant '' End Quote Prof Ed Overton Environmental scientist Apart from the possibility of damage and loss of life unrelated to the oil spill , there is a very obvious downside to hurricanes passing near the source of the oil spill . A hurricane would clearly disrupt the efforts to stop the leak , although BP has a plan to install a device in order to quickly disconnect and reconnect the link down to the spill site in high winds . On shore , tasks like the laying of boom and rescue of wildlife would become more problematic 
ret ==  By Finlo Rohrer BBC News , Washington There have been many devastating images from the Gulf WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE OIL ? `` The good news is that oil is a natural product and is relatively easily degraded , '' says Prof Ed Overton , an environmental scientist at Louisiana State University . Some of the oil will be picked up by skimmers Oil which has not been dispersed or washed up on shore will be targeted by microbes . `` They use the oil as a food , '' says Prof Overton . There is an advantage in that the spill happened in the warm Gulf of Mexico , where conditions are good for decomposition . In colder climes , things can be harder 
ret ==  By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News The oil has covered waters key to creatures such as crabs Following release of the US government 's latest estimate , the Deepwater Horizon disaster is confirmed as the biggest ever accidental release of oil into the oceans . It exceeds the 1979 Ixtoc I leak - also in the Gulf of Mexico . It 's comfortably bigger than tanker releases such as the Torrey Canyon and Amoco Cadiz , and 20 times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill with which it is often compared . Now that BP finally appears to have the flow under control , an important question - perhaps the most important of all - is being asked : it may have been the biggest , but was it the worst ? It is a simple-sounding question , but devilishly hard to answer . What impacts are we talking about - on the coast , on the ocean surface , or the sea floor ? Which species are we including - fish , shrimp , insects , plants , birds , whales , turtles - or some combination of them all ? Are we looking long-term or short-term , local or regional - and are we to include or exclude impacts from the use of chemical dispersants and fires and the other containment measures ? One thing that is clear is that different parts of the Gulf coast have seen very different levels of impact 
ret ==  Louisiana fish deaths raise oil spill questions The dead fish found at Bayou Chaland in Plaquemines Parish , Louisiana , include pogies , redfish , drum , crabs , shrimp and freshwater eel , officials say Officials in Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish have called for an investigation after finding hundreds of thousands of dead fish near the Mississippi River . The Plaquemines Parish Inland Waterways Strike Force claims oil was spotted in pictures of the dead fish . The group is now attempting to find if the BP oil spill was connected to the incident , known as a `` fish kill '' . The cause of the fish kill has not been determined , but such events typically happen due to depleted oxygen levels . The types of fish affected at Bayou Chaland , near the mouth of the Mississippi River , include pogies , redfish , drum , crabs , shrimp and freshwater eel , Plaquemines Parish officials said 
ret ==  It took Louisiana 's oyster industry years to recover from Hurricane Katrina Louisiana 's oyster beds have not recovered from the US 's worst environmental catastrophe , the Deepwater Horizon oil-rig disaster , and some fishermen fear they never will . We were fishing at the end of the world - or at least a place that felt like it . Grand Isle is one of the final precarious fragments of land where the myriad bayous of the Mississippi delta give way to the open water of the Gulf of Mexico . Around us , hungry frigate birds watched as we headed for the oyster beds . For the first time in my life , I had oysters for breakfast Pelicans swooped by in formation , low and effortless , and a pair of dolphins raced just ahead of the bow , daring each other to get closer and occasionally rolling sideways to check we were suitably impressed 
ret ==  By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News Vast amounts of methane are present in the Arctic , often in the form of hydrates Writing in journal Science , US researchers report that methane-absorbing bacteria multiplied in the Gulf following the April accident . The Arctic contains vast stores of methane , and its release could quickly accelerate warming around the world . But scientists caution that the regions are very different . The research ship Pisces , operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- , made several voyages into the Gulf in the months following the leak . `` There were thousands of different types of molecule coming out of the well , and by far the most abundant was methane , '' said research leader John Kessler , from Texas A and M University 
ret ==  US oil spill : Fishing villages ` on the edge ' Some fishing boats are now being used to help BP control the slick George Barisich 's fishing boat has survived three major hurricanes - Gustav , Ike and Katrina . `` My house was underwater , but she survived , '' he says , giving the boat a loving pat . But Mr Barisich fears what will sink his commercial fishing business once and for all is not a natural disaster , but a man-made one . A man 's got to have a hope , some kind of light at the end of the tunnel '' End Quote George Barisich Louisiana fisherman `` People laugh at us when we say this oil spill could be worse than Katrina , but we ai n't joking , '' he says . As he heats up a huge plate of shrimp pasta in the boat 's microwave , George says he is worried that the spill will be last straw for many people in this tight-knit fishing community of Bayou La Loutre , Louisiana
