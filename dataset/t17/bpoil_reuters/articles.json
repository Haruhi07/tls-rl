HOUSTON | Thu Apr 22 , 2010 7:30 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An oil drilling rig that had burned for 36 hours in the Gulf of Mexico sank on Thursday as hopes dimmed for 11 missing workers and the risk of a major oil spill loomed , officials said . The fire went out as the Deepwater Horizon , operated by Transocean Ltd , sank below the surface at 10:21 a.m. CDT -LRB- 1521 GMT -RRB- , about 42 miles off the Louisiana coast . The rig was drilling BP Plc 's Macondo project with 126 workers on board when it was ripped by an explosion and fire on Tuesday night . Some 115 workers escaped , including 17 helicoptered to New Orleans area hospitals with injuries . Search and rescue operations turned up two empty lifeboats , and officials cited dim hopes that the 11 workers missing since the blast about 10 p.m. CDT Tuesday night would be rescued . `` We do continue with search and rescue activities , '' the 8th District Coast Guard Commander Rear Admiral Mary Landry said . `` As time passes , however , the probability of success in locating the 11 missing persons decreases . '' Transocean , based in Zug , Switzerland and the world 's largest offshore drilling contractor , said some of the missing may not have been able to escape the rig . `` Based on reports of crew members , at the time of the incident , they believe they may have been on board and not able to evacuate , '' said Adrian Rose , a vice president of Transocean . U.S. lawmakers called for the Coast Guard and Minerals Management Service to investigate the incident . `` It is critical that these agencies examine what went wrong and the environmental impact this incident has created , '' said Sen. Mary Landrieu , Louisiana Democrat . The explosion comes almost three weeks after President Barack Obama unveiled plans for a limited expansion of U.S. offshore oil and gas drilling . It was unclear whether the rig sank to the bottom in about 5,000 feet of water , or how much oil still flowed or had spilled from the well , officials said . By Thursday afternoon , a five-mile long oil slick extended from the accident site , which has the potential to be a `` major '' oil spill , the Coast Guard said . Officials said floating oil spill barriers , skimmers and airplanes to drop dispersant were being prepared to control and clean up the spill . A remotely operated unmanned submarine , commonly used in the industry , was deployed to determine the exact location and condition of the rig and the situation of the well , which extends 5,000 feet through water and 13,000 feet beneath the seabed . `` We continue to assist Transocean in the effort to halt the flow of oil from the well through the use of a remotely operated vehicle to activate the subsea blowout preventer , '' said David Rainey , vice president of Gulf of Mexico Exploration for BP , a leading oil and gas operator in the Gulf . Officials said an investigation was being launched to determine exactly what happened . Sometimes oil and gas well drilling hits pockets of high pressure that were not anticipated and can not be controlled , experts said . The well in Tuesday 's accident was the first of a series to be drilled and was in the process of being temporarily plugged pending production . `` The well had been cased off . We were actually in process of running the final plug , '' Rainey said . `` At this point , we do n't understand what happened . '' The rig explosion did not have an effect on crude oil prices because the well was not in production mode .

L -RRB- failed to reassure investors with a more than doubling of first-quarter net profits on Tuesday , as the oil major 's shares fell on growing fears about the impact of a worsening oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . BP said replacement cost net profit , which strips out unrealized gains related to rises in the value of inventories , was $ 5.60 billion in the quarter , up from $ 2.39 billion in the same period of 2009 , thanks to higher oil and gas prices . The underlying results were well ahead of forecasts but were overshadowed by concerns about an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico which is leaking 1,000 barrels per day of crude after the rig drilling it exploded and sank with the loss of 11 workers , who are now presumed dead . BP 's shares fell 1.3 percent to 618.5 pence , underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . SXEP which was 0.9 percent down at 0836 GMT . `` The situation in the Gulf of Mexico is now looking more pessimistic and it looks increasingly likely that it will take months rather than days to remedy . Ultimately , the costs associated with this accident will be proportional to the time taken , '' said Dougie Youngson , oil analyst at Arbuthnot . The spill grew to cover 1,900 square miles on Monday as the U.S. Coast Guard scrambled to keep the slick from reaching the fragile Gulf Coast shoreline . BP is responsible for the costs of the cleanup operation and could also face lawsuits . The rise in profits was due to a recovery of crude and gas prices from the recession-hit levels of 2009 . Brent crude rose 72 percent to average over $ 76 a barrel over the first three months of the year . BP managed to outperform expectations partly because it also managed to achieve much higher prices for its gas , despite a drop in European benchmark gas prices compared to the first three months of 2009 . One dealer said the better-than-expected results augured well for other oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc -LRB- RDSa . L -RRB- , which reports its results on Wednesday . Shell 's London-listed `` A '' shares traded up 0.8 percent at 2,005 pence . French oil major Total 's shares were up 0.2 percent at 42.73 euros . Higher throughput at its refining unit also allowed the company to outperform expectations , although a halving of margins compared to the first quarter of 2009 meant the overall result was sharply lower . The world 's third-largest Western oil major by market value said oil and gas production was broadly flat compared to the same period of 2009 , at 4.01 million barrels of oil equivalent per day -- just ahead of forecasts . BP said it had agreed to buy a 15.7 percent interest in Valhall and a 25 percent interest in Hod , both located in the southern part of the Norwegian continental shelf , from France 's Total -LRB- TOTF . PA -RRB- for $ 991 million in cash . It was the latest in a string of acquisitions by the oil major in recent months , after it agreed to pay Devon Energy -LRB- DVN . N -RRB- $ 7.0 billion for assets in Brazil , Azerbaijan and the Gulf of Mexico . The London-based company also said it would pay $ 900 million for a 75 percent stake in the oil sands assets of unlisted Canadian company Value Creation . The tie-up was announced last month but no details on price or stake size were revealed then . Excluding one-off items , which amounted to a net charge of $ 49 million , BP 's replacement cost result was $ 5.65 billion , ahead of an average forecast of $ 4.78 billion from a Reuters poll of nine analysts .

The UK oil and gas major is sparing nothing in dealing with the fatal explosion on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig . Tony Hayward , the chief executive , has deployed 32 ships , two rigs , five airplanes and over 1,000 people . That may seem excessive for a relatively small spill , estimated at 1,000 barrels a day , but too much is better than too little . Mr. Hayward is clearly worried about BP 's reputation , which had been badly damaged when he took the job three years ago . In both a 2005 explosion in the company s Texas City refinery and problems in an Alaskan pipeline , BP was directly responsible and partly at fault . This case looks different : the rig was operated by Swiss contractor Transocean and the problem appears to have been technical , the failure of a key piece of equipment , the blowout preventer . But even if this accident was extremely bad luck -- the blowout preventer is supposed to be fool-proof -- BP designed the project and is ultimately responsible for the clean-up . That might take months and cost as much as $ 200 million , including the expense of drilling a relief well . In addition , there could be lawsuits . Investors seem to see even worse damages . They have wiped more than 6 billion pounds the company 's market capitalization since the spill , despite strong quarterly results . A big worry is that the spill provokes a public backlash on deep sea drilling , which is the new frontier in oil and gas exploration . It is hard enough to contain an oil spill on land , but it is much harder depths of 5,000 feet . There are n't any precedents for this kind of spill at those depths . The explosion gives ammunition to anti-oil environmentalists , just when President Barack Obama is considering expanding offshore drilling . The desire to prevent a political explosion helps explain BP 's aggressive response . Mr. Hayward may have cleaned up company 's deeper problems , but he stills needs maximal damage limitation , for the sake of BP and the whole industry . That requires is a swift clean-up , and no more freak accidents . It amazes me to see how disjointed the oil industry is when needing to get their message out , whether it 's to explain issues around exploration and production or address catastrophes like the fire and spill in the Gulf of Mexico . They all still communicate like it 's the 1950s and it 's almost always in crisis mode . Maybe some day they 'll learn that by providing facts about E&P and addressing the potential issues , costs , benefits , dangers ... they 'll be able to put a better message out about why these events , even though disastrous , are so rare and how they constantly work for a safer working environment and a smaller environmental footprint . Their lack of understanding when it comes to communications leaves them wide open for criticism at times like these . Why have BP and Transocean not been out front to mobilize employees and volunteers to assist along the coastlines and sensitive environmental areas ? Have they held any public meetings in the coastal communities ? Yes , they are focusing on trying to stop the flow of oil but they 're big boys and they can do more than one thing at a time , especially when it comes to the environment they want to operate in . If we are going to explore in water we need to have foolproof methods of controlling mishaps . They are saying this spill is up to 5,000 barrels a day and it could take 90 days to stop the flow ! The damage it may cause in environmentally sensitive areas of Louisiana and over to Florida is n't easily contained or cleaned up ! I think they will get the clean up done and minimize damage . I think the fact that it is in a warm water area makes it easier . It takes time to figure out exactly how to fix the problem and clean up is a matter of getting enough equipment there to get it cleaned up . Please also do not forget that a pipeline owned by a BP subsidiary exploded near Bellingham , WA in 1999 and killed 3 people . It could have been even worse than it was . The subsidiary was found at fault . BP appears to have a systemic problem with managing and mitigating risk . Today 's article in the Wall Street Journal -LRB- 4-29-2010 -RRB- summed up the problem here in the US . Apparently Norway and Brazil require the use of an acoustic switch on the blow out preventer valve in addition to the cable from the control room on the drilling rig . The acoustic switch which can be activated remotely as a back up system to close the valve . It costs about $ 500,000 which is about 0.10 % of the cost of the drilling rig that was lost and about 2 hours worth of clean-up reported to currently be $ 6,000,000 per day . My 13 year old grand daughter read the WSJ article and said `` It was a poor decision not to have the acoustic switch installed to shut off the blowout valve on the rig '' . I wonder why the US Mineral Management engineers could not come to the same conclusion ? Could it be the decisions in all US Government Agencies are made by industry lobbyists based on saving a few dollars and are not based on good engineering practices to protect life , property and the environment ?

Investors are growing increasingly concerned about the impact of the leak . Since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig caught fire , BP 's shares have fallen 11 percent , knocking around $ 20 billion off its market capitalization . `` It could have a material impact on the company 's financials , '' one fund manager said . The drop is despite the company reporting much better than expected first quarter results on Tuesday . BP 's shares traded down 6.8 percent at 582 pence at 1516 GMT , lagging a 1 percent drop in the STOXX Europe 600 oil and gas index . As happened in previous days , the biggest share price drop came after markets opened in the United States where BP also has a listing . BP said the clean-up operation was costing it $ 4 million a day , although this is likely to increase sharply if the slick hits land . BP could face much higher costs from potential lawsuits , punitive damages and reputational damage , which would hit its ability to grow output in the United States , its most important market . The clean-up team , which includes the U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies , began a controlled burn on parts of the slick on Wednesday , to try and limit the amount of oil that looks set to hit the shore . Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the worst oil rig disaster in almost a decade . Swiss-based Transocean Ltd 's Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 , two days after it exploded and caught fire while it was finishing a well for BP about 40 miles southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River . Five thousand barrels of oil are leaking a day , up from an earlier estimate of 1,000 barrels . Underwater robots failed to activate a cutoff valve on the ocean floor to stop the leak . BP is hoping a plan to cover the well with a steel cap and capture the leaking oil will avert an environmental disaster . However , this will take four weeks to put in place , by which stage over 150,000 barrels could have been spilled . If the steel cap does not work , BP will have to rely on stemming the flow by drilling a relief well , which would take two to three months . By this stage , the spill could be over 300,000 barrels - larger than the 258,000 barrels leaked by the Exxon Valdez in the U.S. 's worst oil spill to date . However , a BP spokesman said the environmental damage from and cost of tackling the leak from the Macondo well would not be in the same range as the Exxon Valdez tragedy , which happened close to shore in the narrow Prince William Sound in Alaska . Exxon spent $ 3.5 billion cleaning up the Valdez spill and had hundreds of millions of dollars in damages awarded against it . The fact the Macondo spill can be treated offshore and that the oil involved is light , rather than the heavy crude the tanker Valdez carried , should reduce the environmental damage .

The threat could not come at a worse time as the oyster season ends and shrimp season is set to begin . For Joe Jenkins , owner of Crystal Seas Oysters , an oyster and shrimp processing factory in the picturesque Mississippi coastal town of Pass Christian , there is little option but to wait and hope disaster does not strike . `` It 's time for the little shrimp to start coming out so we can catch those guys , '' Jenkins said . `` An oil spill will kill all of those guys . '' Around 100 boats work out of Pass Christian , one of the busiest harbors on the Mississippi Gulf Coast . As the Coast Guard and oil company BP Plc struggle to contain the slick from a blown-out well off Louisiana , states to the east were deploying fire-retardant booms and other measures to protect their coastlines . The slick , five times bigger than first thought , threatens the eastern shores of Louisiana and could also affect coastal waters in Mississippi , Alabama and northwest Florida . The Southern Shrimp Alliance told the National Marine Fisheries Service in Washington this week it could help with prevention and clean-up . `` They are willing to pull booms if they have to , '' said Deborah Long , a spokeswoman for the non-profit trade alliance . `` The timing of this could be horrible . '' U.S. landings of shrimp were valued at $ 442 million in 2008 , up 2 percent from the previous year , according to the National Marine Fisheries Service . But the industry has been hammered by cheap imports and falling international prices , Long said . At this time of year , shrimp head out to sea from inland estuaries where they spawn . The industry fears a southerly wind could keep oil off the coast but push the shrimp into the slick , Long said . The slick could also hit the tourism sector that is vital to Gulf Coast economies . In Alabama , coastal residents and businesses were `` frantic '' about the possible impact if the slick was blown east , said George Crozier , director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab , a state marine research facility . Tourists spent $ 2.3 billion on Alabama 's beaches in 2008 , supporting 41,000 workers , according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau . But Alabama 's beaches would be easier to clean than salt marshes and oyster reefs . Crozier said the state 's oyster fisheries are in `` immediate jeopardy . '' `` If they ca n't stop it and we wind up dealing with a flow of oil for three months , that carries us into hurricane season and all bets are off because it becomes a very significant ecological problem , '' he said . The spill could also fracture a fragile relationship between Louisiana 's powerful energy lobby and environmental groups that say decades of exploration have hurt the coastline . Coastal Louisiana sits on the Mississippi Delta and environmentalists say inland oil and gas exploration and the building of pipelines and canals have eroded wetlands . That loss exacerbated the storm surge in Louisiana that devastated New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and an oil spill will do further harm , said Steven Peyronnin , executive director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana . `` We have a catastrophe on our hands right now . This is a moment to change policy , to really look at the risk we have undertaken here for a century and make changes , '' he said . `` The state 's greatest challenge is to find a way to harmonize safe , effective -LRB- oil and gas -RRB- production to maintain the state 's engine and to recognize the natural system as important to the state as well . '' But restoring wetlands would cost big money . Estimates even before Katrina stood at $ 14 billion , Peyronnin said .

L -RRB- and owners of the oil rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , marking the first claim for economic losses stemming from the disaster . The lawsuit was filed late on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in New Orleans as London-based BP and the U.S. Coast Guard fought to contain a massive oil slick expected to hit the Gulf Coast on Friday . -LRB- ID : nN29104665 -RRB- The suit was filed on behalf of two commercial shrimp fishermen named in the suit , and all other coastal Louisiana residents whose livelihoods are threatened by the spill . The Coast Guard estimates that 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of crude oil a day is gushing from the sea floor where the blowout occurred , and authorities have said it could take weeks to cap the leak as BP mounts what it calls the largest oil spill containment operation in history . The suit names as defendants BP , which holds the lease to the offshore well ; Swiss-based Transocean Ltd RIGN . N -RRB- , owner of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that exploded in flames on April 20 and collapsed two days later ; and Halliburton Energy Services Inc -LRB- HAL . N -RRB- , which the suit says was engaging in cementing operations of the well and well cap . The complaint says Halliburton `` improperly and negligently performed these duties , increasing the pressure at the well and contributing to the fire , explosion and resulting oil spill . '' The suit also names Cameron International Corp -LRB- CAM . N -RRB- , which supplied the rig 's blow-out prevention equipment `` that failed to operate upon the explosion -LRB- and -RRB- should have prevented the oil spill .

LONDON | Fri Apr 30 , 2010 3:26 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc will compensate all those affected by an oil spill from one of its wells in the Gulf of Mexico , said its chief executive , who admitted that the disaster could hit plans to open new areas off the U.S. coast to drilling . `` We are taking full responsibility for the spill and we will clean it up , and where people can present legitimate claims for damages we will honor them . We are going to be very , very aggressive in all of that , '' Tony Hayward told Reuters in an interview on Friday . The massive spill , which started when an oil rig caught fire and sank last week , washed up to wildlife refuges and fishing grounds on the Louisiana coast on Friday . The cost to the fishing industry in Louisiana could be $ 2.5 billion , while the impact on tourism along Florida 's panhandle coast could be $ 3 billion , Neil McMahon , analyst at investment firm Bernstein , said in a research note on Friday . The spill could also hamper President Barack Obama 's plans to open some offshore areas of the U.S. where oil exploration is currently barred to drilling , Hayward said . `` There may be an industry issue around what may or may not be opened , '' he said . However the CEO hopes an effective response to the spill , including a flotilla of around 80 vessels and several aircraft , would reassure people about the risks of drilling . `` It would be bizarre to say it should n't influence the debate . How the debate will come out , I think ultimately will be judged by the success we have in dealing with this incident , '' he said . Regulations on drilling safety will also come under scrutiny , Hayward predicted . `` Rightly , there will be a reaction . Whenever you have something of this significance , it 's right that regulators should look very hard at what they can do to further ensure that something like this never happens again , '' he said . He said possible changes could relate to testing of equipment like the blow-out preventer on the ocean floor which failed to operate correctly and shut off the flow of oil , although he added it would be impossible to say how testing could be improved until the cause of the accident was known . Failures of blow-out preventers are extremely rare and the equipment is regularly tested . The scale of the disaster could also lead to changes in the rules on who is allowed to operate licenses in the deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico , analysts said . The government could limit operating licenses to larger companies -- like BP -- which have the deep pockets and operational capability to mount large cleanup operations . BP shares closed down 1.5 percent on Friday , bringing the total drop in the shares since the rig disaster was announced to around 13 percent -- a loss of around $ 20 billion in its market capitalization . Analysts expect the final cost of the incident to BP to be under $ 10 billion , and so said the price drop represents a buying opportunity . BP has spent the last five years trying to rebuild its reputation in the U.S. , after it took a big hit from a refinery explosion in 2005 in Texas which killed 15 workers and oil and gas leaks in Alaska in 2006 -- both of which regulators blamed on cost-cutting . Eleven workers are missing , presumed dead , following the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which was operated by Swiss-based Transocean Ltd , the largest independent driller in the world . BP owns 65 percent of the block in which the well was being drilled , and is field operator . U.S. explorer Anadarko Petroleum Corp owns 25 percent . The partners in the field are responsible for the cleanup costs on a basis proportionate with their shareholding , although BP has the leadership role because of its operatorship of the block . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin , Editing by Andrew Callus and Gerald E.

They 've had over a week to plan and mobilize whatever is necessary to stop the spill . Remember , BP announced right after the oil rig disaster that there was no leak -- I guess 42,000 gallons per day is hard to hide . The amount of the leak is n't the announced 42,000 , it is actually at least 200,000 . The spin control has started already and the people hurt the most will never be compensated , how do you replace a career ? This discussion is now closed .

Oil began washing up on Louisiana 's coast and commercial fishing areas on Friday as shrimpers and fishermen and survivors of the blast flooded courthouses with lawsuits . `` This is a multi-billion dollar event , '' said Keith Hall , an attorney with the firm Stone Pigman in New Orleans . `` There are going to be huge environmental clean-up costs . '' The explosion killed 11 workers and sank the rig . The oil well , which the companies have been unable to cap , was gushing about 5,000 barrels of crude per day . The rig was owned and operated by Zug , Switzerland-based Transocean Ltd RIGN . S. British oil major BP Plc -LRB- BP . L -RRB- hired Transocean to drill the well , and oilfield services companies Halliburton Co -LRB- HAL . N -RRB- and Cameron International Corp -LRB- CAM . N -RRB- were also doing work on the rig . BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward told Reuters on Friday the company will compensate all those affected by the oil spill . -LRB- IDn : nLDE63T1SP -RRB- Oil majors generally do not buy coverage for clean-up costs from spills , as it is too expensive or unavailable . The other companies on the project do hold insurance , but Hall said potential liability could outstrip any policy payouts . Transocean said its insurance covers the total loss of the Deepwater Horizon and wreck removal . The rig had an insured value of $ 560 million . -LRB- IDn : nN26150882 -RRB- . Cameron International Corp -LRB- CAM . N -RRB- , which supplied the device that failed to prevent the well blow out said it had a $ 500 million policy for any claims . -LRB- ID : nWEN3872 -RRB- . The global insurance industry is already estimating that property insurance losses will likely exceed $ 1 billion , while liability claims could dwarf that and take years to play out . Plaintiffs attorney have already targeted the companies with lawsuits seeking compensation for economic loss and loss of life or injury . Brent Coon , the Texas lawyer who spearheaded civil litigation against BP in the aftermath of the 2005 explosion at its Texas City , Texas refinery that killed 15 workers , said his firm is representing a worker who survived the explosion in a lawsuit against BP , Transocean Halliburton and Cameron . His firm is seeking a temporary restraining order against the companies to mandate that they preserve all documents and e-mails related to the disaster in anticipation of drawn-out litigation . Coon 's client , Stephen Stone , 24 , of Katy , Texas , was asleep when the explosion happened and escaped on a lifeboat . `` It 's like being in a war , to be caught in those kind of infernos with people screaming and not knowing whether you 'll live or die , '' Coon said . At least four lawsuits naming all or some of the companies have been filed in U.S. District Court in New Orleans , attorney Hall said . Shrimpers in Louisiana and Alabama have filed class-action lawsuits against the companies claiming anticipated economic losses from the disaster . -LRB- ID : nN29134097 -RRB- . Oilfield service company Halliburton Co -LRB- HAL . N -RRB- provided cementing on the well to stabilize its walls . BP also faces costs related to the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 -- enacted after the Exxon Mobil Corp -LRB- XOM . N -RRB- Valdez spill -- and the U.S. Clean Water Act . The Valdez spill of 250,000 barrels of oil into the Prince William Sound in Alaska cost Exxon about nearly $ 4 billion in compensatory payments , cleanup payments , settlements and fines , according to the company 's web site . Oil rig accidents bring a patchwork of regular insurance coverage , reinsurance , and self-insurance mechanisms , said Claire Wilkinson at the U.S. Insurance Information Institute , the industry 's trade group . `` The great unknown here will be the environmental pollution liability issue . These kinds of events take many years to unfold , '' she said . `` You could draw a parallel with Exxon Valdez -- 20 years later , the final costs are still unknown . '' Munich Re -LRB- MUVGn . DE -RRB- , the world 's biggest reinsurer , has said it could pay up to $ 100 million for the accident , but warned that it is too early to calculate the toll . Bermuda 's PartnerRe -LRB- PRE . N -RRB- expects to pay claims of up to $ 70 million . Even if losses exceed $ 1 billion , it does not appear to be an insurance industry-threatening event . The closest comparison is the explosion of the Piper Alpha rig off the British coast in 1988 , killing 167 , which ended up costing insurers $ 3.6 billion in today 's dollars , according to Swiss Re . By comparison , insurers put the price tag of the 2001 attack on New York 's World Trade Center at $ 23 billion in today 's dollars . Hurricane Katrina , which ravaged the U.S. Gulf Coast , cost insurers $ 71 billion . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . `` B. S. !

Are you people so STUPID not to listen ? Yes , you are so stupid not to listen . If there ever was a more stupid group of beings your all of what is required . But what do you do ? Walk around with NO brains and sitting on them . Now that not only goes for those of the gulf coast , but every one of you idiots that reads this and thinking `` who the hell does this guy think he is ? '' When the hell are you going to realize we do n't need fossil fuels ? When are you going to realize the professionals have all stopped researching for the energy we all need ? So wake up before it 's to late ! You dummies that 's correct ! They have all gone off researching in a field that is so complex they do n't know which end of a stick is which ! And you are so stupid to believe they will find the answers ! That they can solve a simple situation with another complex problem ! What do you want ? Life , DISASTER or disease and more complexity in life under a sick society , Lead by a false godliness ? You have been sitting on your brains ignoring the ONLY profound energy research , We have been asking for help for many years , Since 1980 . Just a simple , but small donation . No , not only to keep the wolf away from the door . But to help us completely eliminate the total use of all fossil fuels , You ignore the only research that has any potential , to completely stop the extinction of life . We gave up asking with a website , But took it off , because of lack of interest from ignorant people like all of you ! Do you not realize this energy will absolutely replace the use of all fossil fuels . The FACT remains NO ONE is doing this research for constant magnetic acceleration . Every one is off on a tangent so far off from solving this problem . If you believe that your leaders will solve the dilemma they created , you are more stupid than you actually are letting on ! What you see today will get worse ! That goes double for all of you so called GODLY people ! Your bible tells and speaks of all the death and destruction coming to this earth . Can you NOT see the idiots you are by allowing your government and industry leaders to flounder the earth for the greed and selfishness of a dollar ? You pray and ask amiss . You do n't see any damned thing of good happening . Do some thing right for a change ! Wake up before it 's to late . When you wait and do nothing , you are a fool just like the bible says you are ! Why do you think Christ said , `` it 's better to live among the meek and lowly than to rule among fools . '' That includes the followers of your leaders . Can you NOT see you idiot Americans of your money it says `` in God we trust '' Since when did God say to worship the all mighty dollar ? That goes for every one on this planet , so do n't think your the only ones being told the truth . Go ahead and carry on like nothing has happened , You will continue to destroy this earth by doing absolutely nothing . Development of destruction for and by the OIL industry , of a select few . just so these people are the only ones to work and make a so called good living . The fight over a necessary evil of oil will continue in all the water 's of this earth . You brainless people , Destroy the water and sea life and you kill this earth . You hear all the big hypocrite names of society including all the dummies of Hollywood , fighting for a better society asking to help the underprivileged of the 3rd world while ignoring the main problems of society -LRB- your followers of a Satanic leadership -RRB- . -LRB- Satan , A silent God seeking the destruction there of this earth ! just to line a pocket -RRB- When you had the time and the right to stop this before it 's to late . Think these big names of society will save the north with their plea for help ? `` B.S. '' Your all sick not doing enough except eat , sleep , drink and be merry , You fool . Now who is going to pay for all of this ? Who is also going to make a fortune from cleaning up this mess , While you should ask who NOW will benefit , and from prior to the mess they made ? Is it the same group of people just playing foolish games with the life of this earth ? YOUR CHILDREN 'S FUTURE ! Who 's destroying it for what ? `` MONEY '' That 's all they 're interested in . They do n't know how to give , LOVE ! You and they should all be ashamed of yourselves . All these years we have NEVER asked for a fortune , but only enough to help get us by . If you do n't believe us , remember to put your head between your legs and kiss it good bye ! We are as honest as the day is light and have told you exactly how we see it . Your stupid media reporting system stinks ! While their aim is to repeatedly bombard you with useless advertising , for the same idiots ruining this earth . They do all this and do n't speak up against the leaders of HELL . Allowing them to continue their agenda . That goes double for all you green movement groups , We been asking you for help that you ignored . We were told not to use such adjectives . But what other language do you idiots understand ? This earth belongs to everyone , NOT JUST YOU ! Blame those who for no other reason want more than they need . Do you think these leaders from the oil companies will be footing the bill ? You can bet your bottom dollar it 's not coming out of their personal pockets , Where it should come from ! But your money as a tax payer shall be paying for the clean up . Not only with your money but with lose of wild life and the ecology of the gulf . Where are these green groups ? Are they screaming disaster ? No their brains are stuck in AWE ! While their brains are stagnant over the mess . They 'll show up sooner or later with mediocre plaques etc. . Mean while your debt gets greater and their pockets get filled . Where 's all these groups along with your philanthropists , big mouths when this happened ? Oops , sorry if I offended all of you that are collecting the big dividends on oil stocks ! When the oil is no longer needed , Who will you blame for your loss ? You will wish you had invested a little some thing in C.M.A. energy research . Well when that happens , `` SORRY IT 'S TO LATE ! '' Stop the use of fossil fuels -LRB- NOW -RRB- by Donating to , % D Chura -LRB- that 's to prevent theft by mail etc -RRB- Wow . blah , blah , blah . BP is going to lose 1\\/2 its market value on this whole disaster . BP should be forced to make a larger percentage of its own workers labor to clean the spill , including and especially the executives . Why is it that they are n't made to labor visibly and publicly to clean up their own mess ? That 's what a truly responsible set of leaders would do with such an awful disaster ; admit responsibility , then work as hard as possible to fix it . Why can they just say , as they have been saying , that they are `` trying with their best efforts '' ? We all know that they should be doing much more and that they will yet keep waiting for others to bail them out . This discussion is now closed .

An oil drilling rig on lease to London-based BP -LRB- BP . L -RRB- -LRB- BP . N -RRB- exploded in flames on April 20 and collapsed two days later , leading to a massive oil spill that threatened to become the worst U.S. ecological disaster ever . The spreading oil has deepened fears of severe damage to fisheries , wildlife refuges and tourism in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . Shrimp fishermen in Louisiana have filed a class action lawsuit against BP , accusing it of negligence . `` The ultimate financial impact on BP will depend on how the environmental and economic impact develops when the spill reaches land , '' Fitch said in a statement . Costs could be more than $ 3 billion , depending on how long it takes to arrest the flow of oil into the Gulf , Jeffrey Woodruff , senior director in Fitch 's energy team in London , said in the statement . Insurance will likely cover the majority of BP 's costs , limiting rating pressure , Fitch said . It now rates BP AA-plus , just one notch below its top rating of AAA . There are precedents for assessing the potential impacts , Fitch said . In the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill , when about 250,000 barrels of crude oil were spilled into Prince William Sound , Alaska , cleanup costs were an estimated $ 2 billion , Fitch said . Exxon was eventually found liable for actual damages of about $ 287 million and compensatory damages of about $ 500 million after a series of appeals spanning nearly 20 years , Fitch said . Exxon was originally assessed punitive damages of $ 5 billion but a US Supreme Court ruling in 2003 imposed limits on punitive damages , helping reduce Exxon 's liability , Fitch said . Assuming the BP oil spill is worse than the Exxon Valdez accident , as environmentalists are now claiming , and it takes an additional 60 to 90 days to drill a relief well and stop the leak , the total spill could be about 1 million barrels , Fitch said . Fitch said it will take rating action if necessary because of significant increases in BP 's estimated environmental or litigation costs . -LRB- Reporting by Dena Aubin ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

STOCKACCUMULATO This discussion is now closed . We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1695", "dct": "2010-05-01", "dates": [null, null], "text": "-- Riki Ott , PhD , has written two books on the Exxon Valdez oil spill impacts on people , communities , and wildlife , including the recently released Not One Drop : Betrayal and Courage in the Wake of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill . Any views expressed here are her own . -- I remember the words , We ve had the Big One , with chilling clarity , spoken just over 21 years ago when a fellow fisherman arrived at my door in the early morning and announced that the Exxon Valdez had run aground in Alaska s Prince William Sound and was gushing oil . For the small fishing community of Cordova , Alaska , where I lived and worked as a commercial fisherma am , it was our worst nightmare . That nightmare is reoccurring now with BP s deadly rig blowout off the Gulf Coast with haunting parallels to the Exxon Valdez . I was not at all surprised when officials reported zero spillage , then projected modest spillage , and then reported spill amounts five times higher than their earlier estimates . As the spill continues , I imagine that even the newly reported amounts will continue to vastly underestimate the actual spillage . Underreporting of spill volumes is common , even though lying about self-reported spill volume is illegal and a breach of public trust . Still , penalties are based on spill volume : Exxon likely saved itself several billion dollars by sticking with its low-end estimate of 11 million gallons and scuttling its high-end estimate of 38 million gallons , later validated by independent surveyors . Sadly , it s a foregone conclusion that BP s promise to do everything we can to minimize the spill s impact and stop the oil still hemorrhaging from the well nearly one mile under the sea off Louisiana s coast will fade as its attention turns to minimizing its liability , including damaged public relations . BP will likely leverage the billions of dollars it will spend on the cleanup to reduce its fines and lawsuit expenses , despite later recouping a large portion of the cleanup cost from insurers or writing it off as a business expense as Exxon did . Such tactics saved Exxon billions of dollars in the civil settlement for damages to public lands and wildlife -LRB- in which damages were estimated at up to $ 8 billion ; but for which Exxon paid just $ 900 million -RRB- and in the class action lawsuit filed by those whose livelihoods were curtailed by the spill -LRB- for which the original jury awarded $ 5 billion in punitive damages ; but which Exxon fought for 20 years until the Supreme Court lessened its burden to just $ 507 million -RRB- . That Supreme Court decision strictly limited corporate liability and essentially removed the ability of future oil spill victims to hold corporations accountable to the people and the law . A friend in New Orleans is concerned about the oil fumes now engulfing the southern part of town . He says it smells pretty strong -- stronger than standing in a busy mechanics shop , but not as bad as the bus station in Tijuana . State health officials are warning people who are sensitive to reduced air quality to stay indoors , but anyone who experiences the classic symptoms of crude oil overexposure -- nausea , vomiting , headaches , or cold or flu-like symptoms -- should seek medical help . This is serious : Oil spill cleanups are regulated as hazardous waste cleanups because oil is , in fact , hazardous to health . Breathing oil fumes is extremely harmful . After the 2002 Prestige oil spill off Galicia , Spain , and the 2007 Hebei Spirit oil spill in South Korea , medical doctors found fishermen and cleanup workers suffered from respiratory problems , central nervous system problems -LRB- headaches , nausea , dizziness , etc. -RRB- , and even genetic damage -LRB- South Korea -RRB- . I have attended two international conferences the past two years to share information with these doctors . During the Exxon Valdez spill , health problems among cleanup workers became so widespread , so fast , that medical doctors , among others , sounded warnings . Dr. Robert Rigg , former Alaska medical director for Standard Alaska -LRB- BP -RRB- , warned , It is a known fact that neurologic changes -LRB- brain damage -RRB- , skin disorders -LRB- including cancer -RRB- , liver and kidney damage , cancer of other organ systems , and medical complications -- secondary to exposure to working unprotected in -LRB- or inadequately protected -RRB- -- can and will occur to workers exposed to crude oil and other petrochemical by-products . While short-term complaints , i.e. , skin irritation , nausea , dizziness , pulmonary symptoms , etc. , may be the initial signs of exposure and toxicity , the more serious long-term effects must be prevented . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Unfortunately , Exxon called the short-term symptoms , the Valdez Crud , and dismissed 6,722 cases of respiratory claims from cleanup workers as colds or flu using an exemption under OSHA s hazardous waste cleanup reporting requirements . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Sadly , sick Exxon cleanup workers were left to suffer and pay their own medical expenses . I know of many who have been disabled by their illnesses or have died . I have repeatedly warned Congress in letters and in person to strike that loophole because it exempts the very work-related injuries chemical induced illnesses that OSHA is supposedly designed to protect workers from . Remember the Katrina Crud and the 911 Crud ? Standby for the Gulf Crud because our federal laws do not adequately protect worker safety or public health from the very real threat of breathing oil vapors , including low levels typically found in our industrial ports , our highways during rush hour traffic , and our urban cities . Oil is not only harmful to people , it is deadly to wildlife . I am sickened to think of the short-term destruction and long-term devastation that will happen along America s biologically rich coastal wetlands a national treasure and a regional source of income . In Alaska , the killing did not stop in 1989 . Twenty-one years later , buried oil is still contaminating wildlife and Prince William Sound has not returned to pre-spill conditions nor , honestly , will it . The remnant population of once-plentiful herring no longer supports commercial fisheries and barely sustains the ecosystem . While local efforts to boom Louisiana s fragile coasts to keep the oil out will help people feel productive and empowered -LRB- and this is important -RRB- , it is an unfortunate truth that the booms have limited utility and effectiveness . In even mild sea conditions , oil will wash over and under boom . Further , underneath the visible oil slick , there is an invisible cloud of toxic oil dissolved into the water column and this dissolved oil is deadly to shrimp and fish eggs and marine life . Still , the Gulf spill has one advantage over the Alaska spill hot weather and the relatively warm ocean will speed the work of bacteria to degrade the Louisiana crude . Even so , the initial toxic hit is likely to harm generations of wildlife , similar to what happened in Prince William Sound . The oil industry has had over 40 years since the 1967 Torrey Canyon tanker spill in England to make good on its promise to cleanup future oil spills . This latest spill highlights the harsh truth that the industry has failed to live up to its promise . It is time for Americans to demand of our leaders accountability and closure of fossil fuel industries as we transition to new energies . -LRB- 1 -RRB- City of Cordova Fact Sheet , 1989 1 -LRB- 29 -RRB- : Robert Rigg , MD , Letter to Cordova District Fishermen United , 13 May 1989 . File photo shows members of the clean up crew in Prince William Sound begining work cleaning up the worst oil spill in U.S. history from the Exxon Valdez spill , Feb. 4 , 2009 . REUTERS\\/Mike Blake We MUST learn from this . Speak up now to get the US government involved to mobilize the cleanup . The toxic spill must be considered a threat to our homeland security . What is the emergency plan required to carry out for just such a disaster ? This MUST be considered before granting BP the permits to construct this rig . And I 'm not just talking about the costs in dollars . History showes the fact that capitalism is in the pat of distruction , but did some one say that we got to learn from history ! Currently humanity is lost and can not understand anything but monitary relationship which has turn workers to modern slaves , which even can not earn a very simple life with capitalist standards . While capital is driving us twords total colaps , some among us are thinking how to `` reform '' this rotten system , i dobt that humanity will understand the facts in front of his eyes and avoid the worest . I am surprised how doomed humanity is today and there are no sighns that will fight to make real changes befor total colaps . Thank you It 's not the end of the world , people . Yes , it will be a mess for a few months but , unlike Alaska , the Gulf of Mexico is in a hot climate with hurricanes . As soon as the leak is stopped , oil eating bacteria will gain the upper hand and , before you know it , no trace of oil will remain . A million barrels of oil have been leaking into the Gulf from natural oil seeps each year for millions of years . Pick up some BP stock after it finishes tanking , and you will make a lot of money in 6 years when peak oil hits and it goes way , way up . If you want to get all upset and worried about something , peak oil is it . rikki ott needs to be down there on the gulf if for any reason just to explain the human nervous system damage to the hundreds of people who will try to clean up this mess and wont know the long term ratifications to their nervous system and toxicology in their bodies i live with long term exposures and chronic pain due to exposure of oil based products i pray that this does n't turn out like the valdez -LRB- real smart idea buy some bp stock unlike Exxon bp is not an American company so it will be much tougher to buy off the courts and it is n't a small community fighting a giant corporation all those spring break beaches will be hit along with the devastation of the heart and soul of the gulf in the delta and with the knowledge and passion of rikki ott i am sure she will provide many documents to the courts and then we will call it Louisiana petroleum bp is n't getting out of this one so if you want `` buy baby buy '' but you will get burnt thanks ray stawski This article discusses the `` tactics '' Exxon used to reduce its legal and financial liability after the Valdez incident and how BP will likely follow the same damage control path . The language the author uses makes the reader draw the conclusion that these `` tactics '' are somehow underhanded , dirty , and possibly illegal . Unfortunately , Exxon , and now BP , are and will continue to play by the rules , stretching the boundaries of existing laws and policies . To insinuate these companies are somehow underhanded for toeing the line and doing everything possible to work in the best interest of the company\\/shareholders , despite the public tragedy they have caused , is ridiculous . If the public -LRB- or this author -RRB- does n't like the laws and policies regulating oil companies , work to change them . Do n't put these companies in a negative light for playing off the shortcomings in the ` rulebook ' . I know it can be cleaned up . Minimizing the additional flow to the slick is what concerns me . I would be interested in the size of the reservoir tht this is tapped into and the pressure . I would expect that any other deep water rigs would be shut down until a safe way can be determined to operate these rigs . I 've drilled in 5000 feet of water off the Louisiana coast . It 's very technical , very expensive , and very dangerous -LRB- both to men and machines -RRB- . I was offshore for five hurricanes from 1975 to 1980 . The people that do those jobs are very professional . My question is `` Why did n't the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- operate as designed ? '' Was there a communication failure between the wellhead and the surface ? In Alaska the shoreline effected by the spill was about 10 feet deep , If the spill hits the marsh , where the shore is 10 miles deep , then this spill could be thousands of times as destructive . P.S. BP is already handing out all inclusive damage waivers to the fishermen helping with the spill , offering $ 5000 to quit all claims and future claims against BP . BP has been asked to stop , as such an all inclusive waiver is illegal . Now that 's what I call taking responsebility . a documentary about the Valdez oil spill is airing on the green channel called black wave on Sunday may 9th 12 ; 00 am and 3 ; 00am central time it is airing on the green channel 194 for dish viewers it is a much need to watch show about the ramifications of oil spills IT IS GREAT thanks raymond stawski Only 4 % of the Valdez contamination was removed . The rest is now on the floor of the water there . i reread all the post about rikki ott and her quest for tight regulations in the oil and gas industry the may 2 post at 12 ; 15 was about laws and stretching the law my question is WHY DOES A COMPANY HAVE TO STRETCH THE LAW TO ITS MAXIMUM FOR THEIR OWN INTEREST AND SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST . WHY NOT BE THE GOOD GUY AND DO WHATS RIGHT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED . DO N'T STRETCH THE LAW -LRB- THAT 'S WHY NEW LAWS ARE CREATED -RRB- i am sorry i pressed a wrong button and sent this last post out while i edited MY OTHER MAIN POINT WAS DOES ANY AVERAGE PERSON KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO CHANGE , CREATE , OR HOLD UP AN EXISTING LAW . people have dedicated their lives and many years to change injustices or just trying to explain to people an ignorance IN A PARTICULAR LAW , AND THEN TO TAKE ON LOBBYIST PAC GROUP , GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY IT IS MIND BOGGLING THE HOOP JUMPING AND TIME IT TAKES . EVEN IF IT IS A TINY LAW TO JUST PUT IN A DRIVEWAY OR DIG A POND ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY TRUST ME IT TAKES YEARS SOMETIMES THANKS RAYMOND STAWSKI I have some concerns ... My family & I live on the Gulf coast in west central FL . My daughter & I have been experiencing flu-like symptoms for weeks ! She is on her way home from the Drs now . She 's been complaining of a sore throat for about 10 days now , and yet the doc told her that her throat is not red or inflamed . We have had sore throats , headaches , muscle cramps\\/pain , persistent cough and fatigue . In doing research online I have found that we have very similar symptoms to what is called `` Gulf War Syndrome '' ! In my gut I believe that this is being caused by the Corexit that they have been dropping . Ms. Ott , do you have any advice for us ? Or anyone out there that has had experience with this ? I 'm looking for some feedback . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

That bird , recovered offshore on Friday and taken to an emergency rehabilitation center to be cleaned up and nursed back to health , is only the tip of a potential calamity facing the region 's birds , sea turtles and marine mammals . Besides the rescued Gannet , and several sperm whales seen swimming in and around the oil slick earlier , no `` confirmed animal impacts '' have been reported , yet , Dr. Michael Ziccardi , a veterinarian overseeing some of the wildlife rescue teams in the region , said in a telephone interview from Houma , Louisiana . But , he added soberly : `` That is not going to stay the same . We are expecting many more -LRB- casualties -RRB- in the days to come . We hope that number is not catastrophic . We 're ... hoping for the best but planning for the worst . '' Ziccardi is director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network in California , a hub for the world 's leading experts in capturing and caring for oil-soaked sea life . He knows from responding to more than 60 oil spills in California that the full scope of harm to birds and other wildlife only becomes apparent once the oil washes ashore . Oil has been gushing unchecked from a ruptured deepwater well off Louisiana , pouring into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of up to 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons or 955,000 liters -RRB- a day since last week , and so far efforts plug the leaks have failed . As of Friday , the giant slick in the gulf had just begun to make landfall on barrier islands of the Mississippi River Delta off Louisiana . Ziccardi said the risk to bird species would grow as the spill progressed . Oil impairs the insulating properties of birds ' feathers , exposing them to cold and making it difficult for them to float , swim and fly . Chemicals in the petroleum also can burn their skin and irritate their eyes . They also end up ingesting the oil when they preen , damaging their digestive tracts . Similarly , oil can be ingested by turtles and marine mammals , burn their skin and eyes and cause respiratory damage when fumes are inhaled . How high a toll the gulf spill takes on wildlife hinges on several factors that have yet to play out , including the weather , how much of the slick can be contained and how soon crippled undersea well spewing oil can be capped . `` It 's really only going to be clear in the coming days because there are a lot of unknowns , '' said Paul Kelway , a regional manager of the International Bird Rescue Research Center , which sent a team to Louisiana . `` All we can do is prepare these -LRB- rescue -RRB- facilities and get staff trained and be ready to help , '' he said in California . The spill has come at an especially bad time for the region 's bird life . The Mississippi Flyway is a key migratory corridor that runs through the area , said Ziccardi , a professor at the University of California at Davis who wrote the U.S. federal guidelines for rescuing wildlife in oil spills . `` There are certain songbirds and shorebirds that are going through their peak migratory period , '' he said . `` There are other birds for which this is a nesting and egg-laying period . '' The oil-coated Northern Gannet , a sea bird with striking black and white plumage that feeds by plunge-diving for fish and squid , was found in the water . But because most birds tend to stay fairly close to land , they are most vulnerable once the oil washes ashore . `` With turtles and marine mammals , they 're out in the open water , so they are at risk earlier , '' Ziccardi said . Turtles may be particularly hard hit because many have just started nesting or are close to doing so in the gulf . As for marine mammals in the region , some studies have found that dolphins and whales tend to go out of their way to avoid oil spills , while the sperm whales seen swimming around the slick suggest otherwise . Ziccardi said , however , that the large presence of boats and planes in cleanup operations `` are a wonderful deterrent '' in keeping animals out of the danger zone , `` so that has a double advantage for us . '' Some experts have raised the possibility that prolonged difficulty in halting the oil flow from the BP-owned well could lead to an environmental disaster on the scale of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , in which an estimated 250,000 seabirds perished . But Ziccardi said that even if that happens , the mortality level for birds along the Gulf Coast may be smaller . `` We do n't have the same densities of sea birds in this area as Prince William Sound , '' he said . `` But that 's not to say that if the spill continues and birds are affected , we wo n't have sizable losses Ziccardi arrived in Louisiana on Thursday to manage rescue efforts for the five threatened and endangered species of sea turtles in harm 's way , along with manatees , dolphins and other marine mammals . Kelway 's group and another from Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research in Delaware are overseeing bird rescues . They will be relying on teams of trained professionals and volunteers who specialize in capturing , transporting and rehabilitating animals injured by oil spills . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The oil is known to have affected an estimated 90 miles of shoreline , numerous bird species , and recreational use of the bay , such as shell fishing and boating . We need to review the George Stephanopoulos interview the other day in which the Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary E. Landry told George there was no leak ! Where did the Rear Admiral get this faulty information and who does are government think they are dealing with ? OMG a bird was covered in slim !!! SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE GULF COAST DRILLING !!! ... seriousy people ? stopping drilling is a great plan , but first we need to curb our reliance anything with plastic in it or that used plastic in it 's manufacture , we will also need to stop all travel other than than by horse . we will also need to reduce our national electricity consumption by 17 % as it is derived from drilling . If this were to happen out healthcare system would fall apart as modern medicine relies on plastics .

BP will be paying the bill , '' said Obama as he visited the area and pledged a `` fully coordinated , relentless relief effort '' in the region where the coastlines of four Gulf states are being menaced . The swelling black tide threatens wildlife , beaches and one of the nation 's most fertile fishing grounds stretching across the Mississippi Delta from Louisiana to Florida . `` We a dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , '' Obama said . The president toured wetlands in Louisiana at risk from the oil spill , and flew over the coastal areas containing fisheries that could be most affected by the slick . Desperate efforts above and below the ocean surface -- using boats , planes and even an underwater robotic vehicle -- to check the oil flow and disperse and contain the spreading slick were being hampered by high winds and rough seas . The government suspended fishing on Sunday across a wide swath of its Gulf of Mexico waters , on worries about contamination of seafood . `` This is a terrible day . People can still fish west -LRB- of the Mississippi river -RRB- but if the oil keeps flowing the whole coast could be closed down , '' Roger Halphen , whose whole family is involved in commercial fishing , told Reuters in Venice . A team of government agencies is working on relief , but Obama and his deputies made it clear BP would be on the hook for what could be billions of dollars in cleanup costs . `` BOOT ON THE NECK '' OF BP `` Our job basically is to keep the boot on the neck of British Petroleum , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program on Sunday . The final bill for cleaning up the spill could be $ 7 billion , said Neil McMahon , analyst at investment firm Bernstein in London . Analysts at Morgan Stanley put the figure at $ 3.5 billion . Since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank last month , claiming 11 lives , hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude has been gushing into the Gulf with no quick or easy sol BP is simultaneously working on five plans to stop the flow of oil , including installing domes to collect the oil on the seabed and bring it to the surface and installing a new blow-out preventer to replace the equipment that failed , company officials told a media briefing . The first of two domes will be deployed in the next six days . BP is also preparing to drill two relief wells , but rough weather has hampered its efforts . Underwater dispersants are in use to break up the crude before its reaches the surface . BP officials said shutting off the well nearly one mile underwater on the ocean floor is an extraordinarily complicated operation that could take weeks and months . It was like performing `` open heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot-controlled submarines , '' BP America Chairman and President Lamar McKay told ABC News . Shares of BP and other companies involved in operating the lost rig plummeted last week as fears mounted of growing financial costs and legal liability from the accident . The looming disaster threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez catastrophe in Alaska , the worst previous U.S. oil spill to date . The Valdez spill , caused by a wrecked oil tanker , spilled an estimated 10.8 million gallons -LRB- 40.9 million liters -RRB- of crude oil into Alaska 's remote Prince William Sound . Government officials are having difficulty guessing how much oil is spilling from the deepwater well , but have raised their initial estimate of 5,000 barrels a day . `` The worst case scenario is we could have 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons , or 15.9 million liters -RRB- flowing out -LRB- per day -RRB- , '' Salazar said . `` The actual amount is impossible to estimate , '' Doug Suttles , chief operating officer of BP 's exploration and production unit , said on CBS News . The Coast Guard has laid hundreds of thousands of feet of protective booms to try to halt the encroaching oil , but high winds and rough seas were hampering deployment of the barriers and efforts by boats and planes to spray chemical dispersant on the oil . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced it was closing commercial and recreational fishing for at least 10 days in affected waters between Louisiana at the mouth of the Mississippi River to Florida 's Pensacola Bay . The area accounts for the bulk of U.S. production of oysters and shrimp . The Gulf supports a seafood industry that is second only to Alaska within the United States . In 2008 , commercial fishermen harvested more than 1 billion pounds of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of Mexico , out of total U.S. production of 8.3 billion pounds , NOAA said . The Gulf Coast is home to hundreds of species of wildlife , including manatees , sea turtles , dolphins , porpoises , whales , otters , pelicans and other birds . Obama 's visit came at a time when his administration had been criticized for acting too slowly in response to the growing problems . The spill has also forced Obama to suspend politically sensitive plans to expand offshore oil drilling , unveiled last month partly to woo Republican support for climate legislation , one of the U.S. leader 's priorities . The Minerals Management Service said two U.S. offshore Gulf of Mexico production platforms had been shut down and a third was evacuated as a safety precaution . Further shutdowns were possible , it added , but the output affected so far was very small .

As a huge oil slick advanced toward the Gulf Coast shoreline , the London-based company came under increasing pressure to do more to stop , or at least control , what is fast turning into the worst oil spillage in U.S. history . Comments by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that the Justice Department was involved in the investigation of the incident raised the specter of wide liability for BP over the spill after an April 20 explosion at a rig drilling its well . A Justice Department official said it was not a criminal probe at this stage . Holder has sent two top Justice officials to New Orleans . `` We 're down there to try to ensure that BP is held liable for their responsibility in the spill that has occurred , '' he said . The White House again stressed U.S. President Barack Obama 's commitment to ensuring BP pay the price . `` The commitment the president made yesterday is the responsible party will pay for this and that responsible party is BP , '' spokesman Robert Gibbs said . British markets were closed on Monday but BP 's Frankfurt-listed shares opened 8 percent lower and were down 7 percent at midday , against a 0.3 percent fall in the STOXX Europe 600 oil and gas index . In New York , American Depositary Receipts of BP 's shares fell 7.8 percent to $ 48.10 , bringing their drop since the close of trading on April 23 , to nearly 20 percent . Oil prices moved above $ 86 a barrel . The swelling slick , at least 130 miles by 70 miles , threatened shipping , wildlife , beaches and one of the United States ' most fertile fishing grounds . The government estimates that 210,000 gallons -LRB- 795,000 liters -RRB- of oil a day are pouring into the Gulf , and Obama has called the situation `` a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster . '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward was due to meet Monday with the Interior and Homeland Security secretaries and other U.S. officials to discuss how to control the widening spill . WEATHER HAMPERING FIGHT AGAINST SLICK Hayward on Monday acknowledged his company 's responsibility in appearances on American TV and radio shows , a day after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the administration would keep `` keep the boot on the neck '' of BP to fulfill its legal responsibilities . `` We are responsible not for the accident but we are responsible for the oil and for dealing with it and cleaning the situation up , '' Hayward told NBC 's `` Today '' show . He told National Public Radio the company would pay all `` legitimate claims '' from the spill . In Louisiana , the first point of impact for the slick , rough weather once again hampered efforts to lay protective plastic booms to keep the oil from the shore . `` It 's really bad . I mean they ca n't lay down the boom in this kind of weather with the oil slinging on top . It 's pouring all over the top ... I was going to work today but they turned us around because of the weather , '' fisherman Thomas Tiser , one of many recruited for the cleanup , told Reuters Television . People living along the Gulf coast were bracing for the slick . `` We have an opportunity to lose our entire fishery down here . I mean , not just the customers . It 's everything , '' said Ross Barkhurst , a boat owner in Venice . In a visit to Louisiana , one of four coastal states at risk , Obama stressed on Sunday BP was responsible for paying for the cleanup involving hundreds of boats and planes and thousands of military and civil personnel across five U.S. states . Analysts say the total costs of the spill following the explosion and sinking of a drilling rig operated by Swiss-based driller Transocean nearly two weeks ago could exceed $ 14 billion . BP said last week that it and its partners in the well , including Anadarko Petroleum , were paying $ 6 million a day in cleanup efforts but admitted costs would rise sharply when the oil slick hit land , as would claims for damages . Hayward said the technical options his company was working on to try to seal the ruptured well included an undersea containment system that would capture the leaking oil and channel it to a tanker on the surface . Another option was the drilling of a relief well to intersect the ruptured well and try to control and plug the flow that way , Hayward added . `` The worst-case scenario is that we would need to contain this for two to three months whilst a relief oil is drilled , '' Hayward told NBC . BP was also using undersea robots to try to fix the well blowout preventer , a mechanism he said had failed to keep the oil from gushing from the stricken rig after the accident . BP officials have likened efforts to fix the failed preventer to performing `` open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark . '' `` No one understands why it 's failed , '' Hayward said . Fishing in a wide swathe of federal waters between Louisiana and Florida 's Pensacola Bay was restricted for 10 days on Sunday to avoid any chance that contaminated seafood will make its way to store shelves . The Gulf supports a seafood industry that is second only to Alaska in the United States . The area accounts for the bulk of U.S. production of oysters and shrimp . Wildlife experts also fear a heavy toll on animals and birds . Near Gulfport , Mississippi , 19 sea turtles were found dead and necropsies were being done by experts at the National Marine Fisheries Services . But they had no external oil soiling and it was not clear if the deaths were linked to the slick . U.S. energy output from the Gulf has not been not strongly affected and shipping operations at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port were normal , a port spokeswoman said . Many of the coastal communities in the path of the oil slick , including Venice on the west bank of the Mississippi River , were devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . `` It 's just like Katrina , catastrophic , '' said Frances Lacross , a local resident . The looming disaster in the Gulf threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill of 11 million gallons -LRB- 40.8 million liters -RRB- in Alaska , the worst previous U.S. oil spill to date . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . In this case `` only '' fish , shrimps , oysters and sea birds will be affected but if a nuclear power station melts down potential tens of millions of people will be affected , will die , develop diseases or bear defective children for generations to come . This oil spill will be forgotten in a few years . A nuclear disaster may take thousands of years ... so just sit back and think about this a minute ... Here is a simple fix , make a concrete dome , with a line coming out the top , hooked to a pump at the surface , drop the dome on top of the pipe , what is outside the dome is crimped shut , what is inside the dome is pumped out on a continous basis and processed , this will stop the leakage and buy critical time to fix this problem , the dome can be poured and set in a couple of days and can be dropped by crane Yeah , did n't I see something like that in The Simpson 's Movie .

VENICE , Louisiana | Mon May 3 , 2010 7:54 pm EDT VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP Plc indicated some progress on Monday toward capping the underwater well that ruptured in the Gulf of Mexico almost two weeks ago , pushing a giant oil slick toward the U.S. Gulf Coast . The swelling slick , now estimated to be at least 130 miles by 70 miles , or about the size of the state of Delaware , threatens shipping , wildlife , beaches and one of the United States ' most fertile fishing grounds . `` This spill , it can fundamentally change our way of life here , '' Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said . BP , the British energy company , has been working to plug a leak nearly a mile under the surface of the ocean , under heavy pressure from the U.S. government to try to limit a looming ecological and economic disaster . Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , and Lamar McKay , BP America president , met on Monday with top Obama administration officials including the energy , interior and homeland security secretaries and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , to discuss coordinated response efforts . Separately , BP said crews in Louisiana have finished building the first of three massive steel and concrete containment domes the company plans to lower in place over one of the three leaks on the ocean floor . `` We will load that on a ship tomorrow along with other associated equipment , and transport it to the site , '' Doug Suttles , chief operating officer of BP 's exploration and production unit , told reporters on a conference call . Drilling also started Sunday night on a relief well that could cap the oil spill on the Gulf floor , the company said . Still , this operation is expected to take two to three months to complete . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that the oil slick , which continues to spread over a wider surface area in the warm Gulf waters , will move further east and west by Tuesday , although not necessarily further north toward the coast . Efforts to prevent the slow-moving mass from washing ashore in parts of four states have been hampered for days by choppy seas and high waves in the Gulf , but forecasts suggest calmer conditions in the next few days . `` The stormy weather is clearing as we speak , '' Shawn O'Neil , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in New Orleans , said . `` The winds will stay light and variable all the way through Friday . They will have much improved conditions to do what they need to get done . '' Miles of booms are being laid along the coast of four states in an effort to contain the movement of oil onto beaches and into key wildlife sanctuaries and breeding grounds . The Obama administration has kept the focus on BP to pay for and assume responsibility for the oil spill disaster , which started with an explosion April 20 on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers . For its part , the federal government has come under fire for not responding more quickly to the spreading economic and environmental threat -- criticisms that may have prompted Obama to travel to the affected region on Sunday . The oil spill , which continues unchecked for now , could ultimately rival the Exxon Valdez disaster from 1989 . That spill was caused when a single , massive oil tanker spewed some 10.8 million gallons or 250,000 barrels of crude oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound . Estimates put the daily flow from the current well leak at 5,000 barrels or more , but government and company officials have suggested they that estimate could be low . Comments by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that the Justice Department was involved in the investigation of the incident raised the specter of criminal liability for BP over the spill . A Justice Department official said it was not a criminal probe at this stage . BP 's Hayward on Monday acknowledged his company 's responsibility in a round of appearances on American TV and radio shows , a day after U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the administration would keep `` keep the boot on the neck '' of BP to fulfill its legal responsibilities . Analysts say BP 's total liability could exceed $ 14 billion . In New York , American Depositary Receipts of BP 's shares fell 3.7 percent to close at $ 50.19 . Shares of Transocean Ltd , operator of the sunken oil rig , rose 0.82 percent to 72.91 . Argus Research on Monday downgraded both Transocean and BP to `` hold '' from `` buy '' citing negative impact from the Deepwater Horizon spill . `` In many ways , the timing of this incident could not have been worse , as President Obama recently supported the expansion of drilling activity to areas where it was previously prohibited , '' the brokerage said . Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour , speaking on CNN , said Obama should not move hastily , despite the leak 's severity . `` It would n't be very wise to stop all drilling off the Gulf of Mexico , '' Barbour said , noting that the Deepwater Horizon well was `` one of thousands '' in the area . Oil prices moved above $ 86 a barrel as economic optimism lifted Wall Street and concerns the spill could cause short-term disruptions to supplying . So far , major shipping lanes in the Gulf of Mexico have not seen delays . But the rate to charter oil and product tankers in the Caribbean and Gulf Coast region has surged by 50 percent or more over the past week on worries about potential delays from the oil spill , analysts said . Fishing in a wide swathe of federal waters between Louisiana and Florida 's Pensacola Bay was restricted for 10 days on Sunday to avoid any chance that contaminated seafood will make its way to store shelves . Wildlife experts also fear a heavy toll on animals and birds . Near Gulfport , Mississippi , 19 sea turtles were found dead and necropsies were being done by experts at the National Marine Fisheries Services . But they had no external oil soiling and it was not clear if the deaths were linked to the slick . Before significant amounts of oil potentially come ashore , environmental groups were mobilizing thousands of volunteers to prepare for clean-up efforts . Those that make their living from the sea were already counting their losses . `` We have an opportunity to lose our entire fishery down here . I mean , not just the customers . It 's everything , '' said Ross Barkhurst , a boat owner in Venice . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . I 'm convinced the oil will reach there by then . Brace yourselves people , because if you think your life will not be impacted by this disaster , it will . Time to wake up to what we 've -LRB- yes , WE 've -RRB- done to ourselves . `` BP officials have likened efforts to fix the failed preventer to performing `` open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark . '' Gee and none of these multi million dollar a year executives thought of this when they decided NOT to use the latest safety technology ? BP should have to pay for the clean up . the loss of recreational dollars , the replacement cost of the wildlife . the loss to the shrimping and fishing industries and have a moratorium placed on then to stop pumping oil until all their rigs in the World have been outfitted with the best safety measures money can buy and be mandated to replace as newer and safer technology becomes available .

L -RRB- said on Monday that waiver clauses in contracts it offered to Alabama fishermen to help fight the Gulf of Mexico oil spill had drawn allegations that it was trying to buy them off to give up the right to sue the company . `` That was an early misstep , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told National Public Radio , when asked about Alabama media reports about a waiver campaign . `` It was a standard contract the team was using , '' Hayward said , referring to a contract BP recruiters used to hire fishermen and their boats to assist in deploying booms to help try to contain the oil spill before it reached the U.S. coast . Alabama Attorney General Troy King told Reuters that although he had no first-hand knowledge of the alleged BP waivers practice , he had been told it involved offers of payments of up to $ 5,000 to people affected by the oil spill who agreed not to sue the company . `` They 're saying that it was a mistake and that they 've corrected it . But the fact remains that there are people in Alabama who believe that BP was offering them $ 5,000 in exchange for a release -LRB- from liability -RRB- , '' King told Reuters . `` For many people who live along Alabama 's Gulf Coast , $ 5,000 is a lot of money , '' King said . BP said the company had never intended to apply the waiver clauses in the contracts in question . It said the clauses have since been stripped out of the waivers and any already signed would not be enforced . `` That was eliminated very early in the process , '' Hayward said , adding that about 700 commercial fishing boats were involved in the containment effort in the Gulf . Hayward did not elaborate on the issue in his interview with NPR , but stressed that BP was ready to pay all legitimate claims tied to the oil spill caused by the accident at its undersea well . `` We have the claims process set up , small claims today that are being paid instantly ... bigger claims we clearly have a process to run through , '' the BP chief executive said . BP has not put an estimate on the likely costs of the spill , which follows the explosion and sinking of a drilling rig owned and operated by Swiss-based driller Transocean -LRB- RIG . N -RRB- last month . But analysts say the total bill could exceed $ 14 billion . -LRB- ID : nLDE6410IJ -RRB- King said there were many unanswered question about the claims process , however . He also said there were people in the state who thought BP had launched a behind-the-scenes campaign to limit its liability in the face of a potential deluge of legal claims . If true , it would be a very clear case of `` bad corporate citizenship , '' said King , who added that he would not rule out possible legal action against the company . King said he and his fellow attorneys-general from Louisiana , Mississippi , and Florida would be writing a joint letter to BP on Tuesday demanding that it spell out its commitments as part of the claims process . `` We want to know if they are being responsible .

VENICE , Louisiana | Wed May 5 , 2010 10:27 pm BST VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Workers toiled above and below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday to plug a gushing oil leak and protect the U.S. shoreline in one of the biggest spill containment efforts ever mounted . Mother Nature continued to play a favourable hand . Prevailing winds were expected to hold the giant oil slick offshore for several more days . Conditions will also allow for the first `` controlled burn '' of the massive oil slick since a 28-minute blaze on April 28 that removed thousands of gallons of fuel , officials said . Controlled burns remove oil from the open water in an effort to protect shoreline and wildlife . No populated areas are expected to be affected by Wednesday 's burn and officials anticipated no impact on marine mammals and sea turtles . The Environmental Protection Agency will monitor air quality during the burning . Elsewhere , crews deployed miles of protective booms to block the huge slick and used dispersants to try to break up the thick oil as it slowly drifted near popular tourist beaches and fertile fishing grounds , threatening an environmental catastrophe . London-based energy giant BP used remote-operated undersea vehicles to cap one of three leaks in the ruptured well but oil still flowed at an unchanged rate of 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 litres -RRB- per day . A giant steel containment device to be placed over the leaking well was on a barge headed to the site on Wednesday and would be operating within six days , although it has never been tested at that depth and there is no guarantee of success . `` This has never been done before in 5,000 feet of water or more . They are going to be considerate and take their time , '' BP spokesman Mike Abendoff said . BP has also started drilling a relief well , but that could take two or three months to complete . Several hundred boats took advantage of a second consecutive day of calm seas to lay down miles of containment booms and deploy dispersants , and thousands of military and civilian personnel participated in the operations . In addition , 2,000 volunteers in Gulf coast communities prepared to assist in the cleanup . Authorities were on alert for the first major landfall of the oil slick , estimated to be at least 130 miles -LRB- 208 km -RRB- by 70 miles -LRB- 112 km -RRB- in size , and scientists monitored the impact on marine and coastal wildlife in the region . `` The risks posed by the BP oil spill to the Gulf Coast 's environment and economy continue to grow , '' said National Wildlife Federation President Larry Schweiger . `` The oil we 're seeing on the water 's surface is only part of the problem . Much of it has been sunk by dispersants and suspended in the water column , posing a grave threat to fish and other marine life , '' he said . BP shares hovered flat on Wednesday , rising 0.4 percent , after almost two weeks of declines that wiped more than $ 32 billion -LRB- 21.16 billion pounds -RRB- from the company 's market value . The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index stayed steady on Wednesday . Analysts said the sell-off after the spill was viewed as an overreaction , but Moody 's Investors Service cut its outlook on BP debt to negative , citing uncertainty over the costs related to the oil spill . The spill forced President Barack Obama to suspend plans to expand offshore oil drilling , unveiled last month partly to woo Republican support for climate legislation . The White House and U.S. lawmakers vowed to review a law limiting BP 's liability for lost revenues from fishing , tourism and other businesses to $ 75 million and raise it to $ 10 billion . Suttles said BP , which has promised to pay cleanup costs , would pay `` legitimate '' claims . `` I do n't think the $ 75 million cap is going to be the issue , '' Suttles told CNN . `` Any impacts that are legitimate and created by this , we 'll meet those responsibilities . '' U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is scheduled to visit wildlife refuges in Alabama and Louisiana later on Wednesday to keep the pressure on BP after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which killed 11 workers and started the flow of oil into the sea . Other top U.S. officials continue to beat a path to the Gulf Coast to monitor containment and cleanup efforts . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Commerce Secretary Gary Locke , NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco and EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe will travel to the region this week to meet with federal , state and local officials , as well as local business leaders . Environmental regulators reported a `` first sighting '' of a slick near the Chandeleur Islands , three narrow islands off the southeast coast of Louisiana , on Tuesday . Local officials worried another potential swing in wind direction could threaten the Chandeleurs . `` We have not received any confirmed landfall of oil , '' said Petty Officer David Mosley of the U.S. Coast Guard , who spoke from the Unified Command Centre in Roberts , Louisiana . In Venice , Louisiana , workers loaded lengths of boom onto a barge as part of a plan to protect a vast network of inshore estuaries and canals that form the Mississippi Delta . `` We will monitor the water quality from the barge and at the first sign of oil we will deploy -LRB- the boom -RRB- immediately , '' said Kurt Fromherz , spokesman for Plaquemines parish . The leak , still weeks or months away from being stopped , threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez catastrophe in Alaska , the worst U.S. oil spill . Mississippi , Alabama and Florida are also threatened by the leak . If the slick contacts the so-called Loop sea current , the oily sheen could eventually be carried to Miami in southern Florida , or as far as North Carolina 's barrier islands , warned Robert Weisberg , a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida . `` Exactly when the oil will enter the Loop Current at the surface is unknown , but it appears to be imminent , '' Weisberg said , referring to the prevailing current in the Gulf .

Shares of waste management services firm Clean Harbors -LRB- CLH . N -RRB- soared more than 25 percent to a 20-month high in the wake of the April 21 explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , while shares in water treatment services company Nalco Holding NLC . N rose nearly 20 percent to a year high . Even though it is still unclear how much gains the companies can book , analysts say the revenue potential from the spill does not justify the sharp rise in share prices . Wedbush Securities analyst David Rose said the Nalco share move was exaggerated . `` The stock was getting ahead of itself based on these expectations , '' he said . `` The impact should be relatively minimal . '' Wunderlich Securities analyst Michael Hoffman was similarly skeptical of the Clean Harbors share move . `` While the Gulf oil spill may represent a large clean-up opportunity , we do not believe it warrants Clean Harbors ' recent price move , '' he said . `` No question , the stock over-reacted . '' Both stocks have pulled back more than 15 percent from their initial gains , suggesting that investors were reassessing their initial optimism . `` They -LRB- Clean Harbors -RRB- were being appropriately reserved on the call . As a result , the stock fell as much as it did today , '' Hoffman said . Clean Harbors shares fell as much as 6 percent on Wednesday in intra-day trade . In a similar scenario , five years ago , Clean Harbors ' stock shed more than 20 percent , after the company 's dour outlook on gains from clean-up following Hurricane Katrina disappointed investors . Since the Transocean RIGN . N -RRB- rig exploded and sank last month , claiming 11 lives , hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude have been gushing into the Gulf from the ocean floor with no easy solution in sight . That has boosted demand for products that can contain or dissipate the oil , such as oil booms , detergents and emulsifiers . Naperville , Illinois-based Nalco said it is working with BP Plc -LRB- BP . L -RRB- to apply one of its proprietary chemicals that breaks down oil into small parts that can be eaten and dissolved by naturally occurring bacteria . The rig was contracted to BP , which will bear the cost of clean-up from an ever widening oil spill , while Anadarko Petroleum Corp -LRB- APC . N -RRB- had a 25 percent interest in the well . `` Assuming a clean-up effort on par with -LRB- the 1989 Exxon -LRB- XOM . N -RRB- -RRB- Valdez spill is awarded to Clean Harbors , the inflation adjusted non-recurring profit would be an estimated $ 50 million to $ 60 million , or $ 2.00 to $ 2.50 per share , '' Wunderlich 's Hoffman said . So far , efforts to plug the oil leak have failed . If unchecked , it will take about 50 days to eclipse the Exxon Valdez spill , the worst U.S. oil spill , which sent 10.8 million gallons of crude into Alaska 's Prince William Sound . On a conference call with analysts , Clean Harbors ' executives said it would be premature to speculate on the revenue potential at this time . `` We are participating in the cleanup , but the extent of our involvement has yet to be determined , '' they said . Estimates for Nalco 's profits are also modest . Earlier this week , Nalco CEO Erik Fyrwald said sales related to the spill , till date , had not had a material financial impact . `` We look at anywhere between a penny to 2 cents in potential positive impact , between now -LRB- the second-quarter -RRB- and the third , '' Wedbush analyst Rose said . `` On the whole , we do not expect a significant impact .

BP and its employees have given more than $ 3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years , with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . Donations come from a mix of employees and the company 's political action committees - $ 2.89 million flowed to campaigns from BP-related PACs and about $ 638,000 came from individuals . On top of that , the oil giant has spent millions each year on lobbying -- including $ 15.9 million last year alone -- as it has tried to influence energy policy . During his time in the Senate and while running for president , Obama received a total of $ 77,051 from the oil giant and is the top recipient of BP PAC and individual money over the past 20 years , according to financial disclosure records . In Congress , Sen. Mary Landrieu -LRB- D-La . -RRB- , who last week cautioned that the incident should `` not be used inappropriately '' to halt Obama 's push for expansion of offshore drilling , has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of BP 's largesse . Her comments created some blowback , with critics complaining that she is too blas about the impact of the disaster , even though she was among the first lawmakers to call for a federal investigation into the spill . As the top congressional recipient in the last cycle and one of the top BP cash recipients of the past two decades , Landrieu banked almost $ 17,000 from the oil giant in 2008 alone and has lined her war chest with more than $ 28,000 in BP cash overall . `` Campaign contributions , from energy companies or from environmental groups , have absolutely no impact on Sen. Landrieu 's policy agenda or her response to this unprecedented disaster in the Gulf , '' said Landrieu spokesman Aaron Saunders . `` The senator is proud of the broad coalition she 's built since her first day in the Senate to address the energy and environmental challenges in Louisiana and in the nation . This disaster only makes the effort to promote and save Louisiana 's coast all that more important . '' Several BP executives have given directly to Landrieu 's campaign , including current and previous U.S. operation Presidents Lamar McKay and Robert Malone . Other donors include Margaret Hudson , BP 's America vice president , and Benjamin Cannon , federal affairs director for the U.S. branch . Donations ranged from $ 1,000 to $ 2,300 during the past campaign cycle . Environmentalists complain that Landrieu has played down the impact of oil spills . `` I mean , just the gallons are so minuscule compared to the benefits of U.S. strength and security , the benefits of job creation and energy security , '' Landrieu said at a hearing last month on offshore drilling . `` So while there are risks associated with everything , I think you understand that they are quite , quite minimal . '' `` They own Mary Landrieu and the rest of the Louisiana delegation , '' said Greenpeace Research Director Kert Davies . `` They have more money , disposable income and a fleet of dispensable lobbyists to beat the band . '' Other politicians with ties to coastal states or states with BP refineries have also reaped benefits from the fourth largest company in the world . The top congressional recipients of BP campaign cash include Republican Rep. Don Young of the oil-intensive Alaska delegation , who has received almost as much as Obama , raking in $ 73,300 during his congressional tenure . Also on the list is Sen. George Voinovich -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- , whose state has a BP refinery in Toledo and who has raked in $ 41,400 . Sen. John McCain -LRB- R-Ariz . -RRB- has received $ 44,899 . `` Make no mistake : BP ranks among the most powerful corporate forces in U.S. politics , '' said Dave Levinthal , spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics . `` It donates hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle through its employees and political action committee and is routinely a seven - or eight-figure federal lobbying powerhouse each year . '' In 2008 alone , BP gave $ 37,000 to members of the House Energy Committee and $ 106,501 to members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , which deals with security issues facing the nation 's oil supply . BP has also evolved in its corporate giving over the past decade , shifting more money to Democrats . In 2000 , the company gave almost 39 percent more to Republicans than to Democrats . But by 2008 , Democrats had nearly pulled even with Republicans on BP donations . Moreover , the company has nearly tripled the amount of money it has spent on lobbying , from about $ 5.7 million in 1999 to $ 15.9 million last year , according to lobbying disclosures . BP has bulked up its K Street team by signing some of the biggest firms in Washington , several of which employ former Hill staffers with deep-seated ties to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico coast . BP representation within lobby shop Alpine Group alone includes lobbyist Bob Brooks , who served as chief of staff to former Rep. Jim McCrery -LRB- R-La . -RRB- , and lobbyist Rebecca Hawes , a longtime counsel for former Sen. John Breaux -LRB- D-La . -RRB- . Jason Schendle worked for Landrieu for nine years , according to lobbying disclosures . Former Rep. Jim Turner , now a lobbyist for BP with Arnold & Porter , formerly represented the 2nd District of Texas , which includes a large piece of Gulf shoreline . And at DC Legislative and Regulatory Services , BP lobbyist David Marin was formerly the lead Hill staffer for Congress 's Select Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina . `` First , they are exceedingly competent . Second , they are . I know the first will help enormously in the next few weeks . I am not so sure about the second , '' said Republican energy lobbyist Mike McKen ? na of MWR Strategies , who predicted that Landrieu would quite likely get `` very wide latitude '' on the oil issue . `` That may not be the case with BP , whose record is a bit more spotty .

The device is intended to corral leaking oil almost a mile under the water 's surface and channel it through a pipe to a ship above . Such containment efforts have been tried before in shallow water depths , including after Hurricane Katrina , but the technology is untested in the high pressures and low temperatures 5,000 feet below the water 's surface . The chamber is BP 's best hope so far of corralling the oil until a relief well is drilled within two to three months . The leak began after a blowout preventer at the seabed failed on April 20 , allowing Transocean 's Deepwater Horizon rig to explode and later sink . Below are some details on the chamber and how it is intended to work , from BP and the Deepwater Horizon response team : \\* At the leak site , the device will be lowered by cable to the site of the leak . Once at the seafloor , underwater robots will place it on top of the larger of two remaining leaks . \\* The chamber , 40 feet tall , 24 feet wide and 14 feet deep has steel shelf-like `` mud flaps '' on the side to ensure it does n't sink more than 15 feet into the mud . \\* The funnel-like top of the chamber will be connected to a drill pipe inside a larger pipe , or riser . That mechanism will then be connected to Transocean 's Deepwater Enterprise drillship , which is capable of processing 15,000 barrels of oil per day . \\* The dual-pipe mechanism will allow warm water and a chemical , methanol , to be pumped into the space between the drill pipe and larger pipe . That is intended to counteract the possibility of ice - or sludge-like plugs in the larger pipe that could hinder or stop the flow of oil to the ship . Such plugs can form from natural gas , 3,000 cubic feet of which is in each leaking barrel of oil . \\* When the fluids reach the drillship , they will go to a closed processing system designed for normal well testing . There , the oil , gas and water will be separated . \\* The oil will be stored in a tank that can hold up to 139,000 barrels of oil ; the gas will be flared ; and the water will be dumped back into the sea . \\* The oil collected aboard the drillship can be later offloaded onto a standby vessel , with the capacity to store 137,000 barrels of oil , to take to BP 's 455,790 barrel-per-day -LRB- bpd -RRB- Texas City , Texas refinery to process . \\* The larger leak is estimated to be releasing about 85 percent of the gushing oil from a riser that broke when the rig sank . A second leak stems from a bent pipe connected to the failed blowout preventer at the seabed . \\* A second containment chamber is being built at Wild Well Control in Port Fourchon , Louisiana , to later be placed atop the second leak . In the meantime , underwater robots will continue trying to manipulate valves on the blowout preventer to stop both leaks at the main source .

News that the massive containment dome to be placed over one of the leaks had arrived above the leak off the Louisiana shore appeared first on the popular social media sites . So did word that controlled burns of the oil slick would go ahead on Wednesday after a week of bad weather . `` In a crisis situation , social media is the fastest and most effective way to reach consumers besides television , '' Lauren Hurvitz , a New York-based media consultant who worked in crisis public relations , said on Thursday . `` It 's much more cost effective and direct . '' Oil company BP Plc is also able to control the message without it being filtered by radio , television and newspaper reporters , Hurvitz said . A Facebook page launched by the joint U.S. and BP spill response team , located here has over 11,000 followers . They have access to photos , spill-trajectory maps generated by the government , video on topics including the controlled burns by BP , and summaries of daily news briefings . `` We want to ensure that we can get out information about the response to this incident and spill as rapidly and widely as possible , '' David Nicholas , a BP spokesman wrote in an email . `` Twitter is a clearly popular medium that can complement other , more traditional , communication efforts . '' U.S. responders are also posting video on YouTube and are running photograph slideshows Flickr , according to their main web site , here BP 's critics are also active on Facebook . One site `` Make BP responsible for the Gulf Coast oil spill , '' has 867 followers . Another , `` Speak out on the Gulf oil spill , '' has 227 . BP is n't the only notable party to use social media to comment on the spill . Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has used it to weigh in on the accident . `` Gulf : learn from Alaska 's lesson w\\/foreign oil co 's : do n't naively trust - VERIFY , '' Palin said this week , referring to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . Still , Hurvitz said that corporate messages sent via social media outlets do not reach those who do not have computers or are not familiar with the medium . The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 after a well ruptured . The explosion killed 11 workers , and the well is gushing out of control , spewing crude oil in a massive slick that threatens the coastlines of four states . Fishermen have been banned from working in the waters affected by the spill , which could also damage wildlife and hurt tourism in popular beach resorts . -LRB- Reporting by Anna Driver and Kristen Hays in Houston , editing by Philip Barbara -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "264", "dct": "2010-05-06", "dates": ["2010-05-06", "2010-05-06", "2010-05-05", "2010-04-20"], "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO | Thu May 6 , 2010 8:50 am EDT RIO DE JANEIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brazil will ask oil companies operating its offshore fields to provide information on well control systems and to review their emergency response protocols in the wake of the BP Gulf of Mexico spill , the ANP energy regulator said late Wednesday .

Oil giant BP Plc has been carefully playing the public relations game by saying it bore responsibility for the costs of the clean up of the oil that was shooting out of the damaged well a mile below the surface of the Gulf . But in recent days it has begun to point directly at driller Transocean Ltd as the main culprit . `` This was not our drilling rig and not our equipment . It was not our people , our systems or our processes . Their systems , their people , their equipment , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told the BBC on Tuesday . Transocean , which is the world 's largest offshore oil driller , with rigs used by oil companies around the globe , fired back on Thursday . `` It is inappropriate to speculate on what may have caused the catastrophic failure of a cased and cemented well in advance of that investigation , '' Transocean Chief Executive Steven Newman told a conference call . At stake is potentially billions of dollars of damages for clean-up costs and damages resultinfg from the loss of work for people who live on the Gulf Coast , including many fishermen and shrimpers , and people who run hotels and other tourist businesses . Newman 's comments suggested the subcontracting companies it hired and who were responsible for that part of the operation may also become part of the blame game . Transocean 's Deepwater Horizon rig drilled the well about 40 miles off the Louisiana coast when a pressure surge appeared to cause an explosion on the vessel on April 20 . It sank two days later , leaving 11 workers missing and presumed dead . Well drillers place cement around the casing in the wells to secure the pipes and prevent them from breaking or leaking -- a job performed on the BP well by Halliburton Co , the world 's second largest oilfield services company . But Halliburton has said cementing was completed 20 hours before the accident and that testing had shown the work was done properly . BP has also sent a letter to its drilling contractors , including Transocean , to verify the condition of their blowout protectors -- a valve fitted onto the wellhead that is designed to prevent catastrophic surges of oil and gas . If the BOP was defective , that could drag its maker , Cameron International Corp , into the fray . Investors have already punished Cameron , knocking its stock down 20 percent since April 26 . Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , BP has responsibility to pay for clean up of the spill that could run into the billions of dollars , as well as up to $ 75 million liability for economic damages , according to Alfred Kuffler , a partner at law firm Montgomery McCracken in Philadelphia and an expert in maritime pollution law . `` The responsible party has very limited defenses , '' he said of the law , which was created in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska . A company can only shift legal blame for the accident if it can show another party was responsible , he said , but BP 's contractual relationship with Transocean may prevent such a maneuver . Transocean said its contracts specifically call for BP to indemnify it from any pollution from the well . `` We believe in this particular instance the contract is pretty clear about that , '' Transocean 's Newman said . `` Our industry has a long history of contract sanctity , and we expect BP to honor that . '' With the oil slick still growing , the full cost of the cleanup and the damages will not be known for some time , according to Brent Coon , a Texas lawyer representing a Transocean worker who survived the April 20 explosion , as well as others in the area whose livelihoods are affected by the spill . `` In this kind of case , there 's usually some blame to pass around , '' said Coon , who previously represented victims in the BP Texas City refinery blast . Anadarko Petroleum , BP 's partner in the well with a 25 percent stake , is also on the hook for some clean-up liability , although the Woodlands , Texas company was quick to say it did not make any operational mistakes . Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told investors this week his company had nothing to do with the well design or operating procedures and came in only at the end of planning to approve the project 's budget . -LRB- ID : nN04102706 -RRB- Still , the company was expecting the different parties to begin trading accusations as the facts of the accident came to light . `` There 's going to be a lot of fingers pointing in a lot of different ways , '' Robert Reeves , Anadarko 's general counsel said on a conference call on Wednesday . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It just shows that BP 's ability to check the process sucks and it means that all the righs should be checked . Also , there where a lot of other spills on BP rigs . Have n't they learned anything besides blaming others ? They should nationalise BP and use the future proceeds to make good of al the damages made ! Stop drilling at all you dont have to do that in the future . Use solar thermal power plants like Chevron is doing as fuel replacers or build wind power as fuel savers . PV is maybe to waek ... Look itnto the DESERTEC project OMV seems to have understood ... Corporate citizenship , the honor of thieves and the sanctity of contracts all go out the window when big business stands to lose money . The market has no mercy as smart traders inflict a punishment through share pricing . In the real world the only 's uckers who 'll get fleeced ' are the slow , great government tit and the oil-consuming public .

But hope has already turned to disappointment for many in Louisiana and Alabama who complain that too few people are being selected . Some also say that out-of-state fishermen are taking advantage of a program designed specifically for locals . `` People who have a job -LRB- with BP -RRB- think it 's a good program , but people who do n't , think that it sucks , '' said shrimp fisherman Benjamin Truong whose boat is moored at Buras , a village on the east bank of the Mississippi River . Oil has been gushing from a BP-owned well at an estimated 5,000 barrels a day since a Deepwater Horizon rig exploded two weeks ago off the Louisiana coast , killing 11 workers . Authorities this week closed affected Gulf of Mexico waters to fishing from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to northwest Florida , effectively putting thousands of fishermen out of work at a crucial time in the season . Many said they faced immediate financial hardship with mortgages and boat loans to pay . The situation is worse for those still recovering from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , which destroyed boats and homes but also wiped out savings . BP 's offer of work to clean up the spill provided a double incentive for fishermen . By helping to contain the slick they would earn much-needed income in addition to speeding the clean-up process so they could return to work . Even so , the irony of the situation is not lost on the fishermen , forced to seek temporary jobs with the very company that has put their profession in jeopardy -- and the program itself is ineffective , according to many . `` They are putting certain people to work and certain people are just getting the runaround , '' said Johnny Wilson , who signed a contract to work for BP in Venice , Louisiana , but has yet to be selected . There was no immediate response to the complaints , but BP has said it would employ more people as the program gathers steam , and is working to iron out any problems . Thousands signed contracts in the past week to make themselves and their boats available , and so far 100 people have been given jobs in Louisiana alone in a program that is accelerating , BP spokesman Marti Powers said on Wednesday . Two types of work are on offer : boat owners can earn up to $ 2,000 a day for a vessel over 45 feet , and the company is hiring crews to clean up trash from beaches before the oil strikes , lay protective lines of `` boom '' to keep the oil from spreading into sensitive areas , and other tasks . `` It -LRB- the program -RRB- allows us to take advantage of the local knowledge . These fishermen know these waterways better than we do and their boats are very good for this kind of work , '' Powers said . The company has tried to blunt criticism by opening a compensation hotline and deploying staff to participate in meetings with local leaders , such as Plaquemines Parish President Bill Nungesser in Louisiana . Nungesser and BP community outreach coordinator Dave Kinnaird addressed a town hall meeting in Buras on Thursday for ethnic Vietnamese and Cambodian fishermen . In a measure of the rapport forged with BP since the crisis started , Nungesser told the audience , `` He -LRB- Kinnaird -RRB- has come to express how BP cares for you . '' But fishermen at the meeting complained they felt excluded so far from BP 's jobs program and could not read BP contracts or follow the training course it has provided because they do not speak English . `` I just want a chance to go to work and make money , '' said Thoai Tong , a deckhand who has been acting as a translator for Vietnamese fishermen . If the waters do not reopen for fishing , the community will in the long term be forced to move from the area to find fishing elsewhere , he said . Kinnaird said the fishermen 's concerns would be addressed , and future training sessions and contracts would be translated . In Alabama and Louisiana fishermen reported another problem with the cleanup contracts : outsiders rather than locals were being given jobs . BP contractors have passed over local fishermen to hire out-of-state boat crews to lay booms off the coast of Bayou La Batre , Alabama , the heart of that state 's seafood industry , according to local officials . Hundreds of local fishermen in both states went through more than four hours of hazardous-materials training this week to prepare for temporary work with BP , only to be left waiting for a call that never came , they said . Instead , 81 vessels plying Alabama coastal waters under contract with BP for oil-spill containment work all had crews from elsewhere , some from as far away as Maine , said Bayou La Batre Mayor Stan Wright . `` Not one is from the state of Alabama , '' Wright said . `` I 'm very upset about that . That 's no different than a man coming home for dinner and finding his wife in bed with someone else .

CORDOVA , Alaska\\/SAN FRANCISCO | Fri May 7 , 2010 2:25 pm EDT CORDOVA , Alaska\\/SAN FRANCISCO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - More than half an inch of oil covered the sea when Dennis Kelso 's boat , piled with a few newly dead birds , nudged up against the side of the Exxon Valdez on Friday , March 24 , 1989 . A rope ladder hung down the side of one of the biggest vessels on earth , which had run aground near midnight on a reef in pristine Prince William Sound , a haven for birds , whales and otters , brimming with fish that supplied a multimillion dollar industry . It is also next to the end of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline , and the Exxon Valdez had picked up millions of gallons of crude piped from the top of the frosty state to bring to gas-thirsty consumers in Long Beach , California . Spring was breaking , migrations were starting -- and Kelso was gagging at the rush of chemicals from the liberated oil . `` At the beginning oil was literally boiling out of the tanker , '' said Kelso , the head of Alaska 's Department of Environmental Conservation at the time . The crude began changing as it hit the water , releasing benzene and other pungent chemicals into the air , the start of a months-long process of transforming from a light liquid to a tarry gunk that would cling to more than a thousand miles of beaches in southern Alaska . A close examination of studies of the Exxon Valdez disaster and interviews with many people who took part in the cleanup offers a possible peek into what lies ahead for the Gulf Coast in the coming weeks , months , years -- and perhaps decades . Indeed , by one estimate , about 21,000 gallons of oil still linger on some of Alaska 's beaches , often in the form of dark brown globs just beneath the rocks . What 's more , there are still some experts who argue that the aggressive cleanup following the Exxon Valdez spill proved more harmful than the oil itself . That continuing debate points to another potential cautionary tale about how conflicts among various groups looking to make things right can end up hampering cleanup efforts . The Exxon Valdez was an unrivaled environmental disaster which forced the United States to set a new standard for response to oil spills . Nothing in the United States had come close -- until now . As oil spreads across the Gulf of Mexico , a continent away , from the remnants of a British Petroleum well , the debates over how to contain the crude and what to do when it hits shore are similar to the arguments in Alaska two decades ago . Surprisingly , not much has changed in the technology of cleaning up oil spills , and research on what to do is dominated by `` gray literature '' funded by either oil companies or environmental organizations that makes some experts wary . It 's clear , though , that the warm Gulf waters lapping marshes in Louisiana and the white sand beaches stretching from Mississippi to northern Florida are a world of difference from Alaska 's chilly , craggy , rocky southern coast . Two mercurial forces -- weather and people -- are key for any cleanup . In many ways both acted against Exxon , beset by storms of nature and among warring scientists and politicians , and have played to BP 's advantage . Prevailing winds have largely kept the giant Gulf oil slick offshore for two weeks since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident triggered the breach , and the coast guard is firmly in charge . On the day two decades ago in Alaska , the question of who was in charge was open . The day was calm and the sea was smooth -- perfect conditions for containing a slick of crude . But the view from the bridge , abandoned by the captain after his crew drove the Valdez out of shipping lanes and onto a well known reef , was eerily clear . Exxon had a plan to respond to spills , but the ` designated responder ' it had hired was n't responding . In fact , the boat that was supposed to be in the water , ready to launch at the first word of an accident , had been in dry dock covered with snow . The Valdez ran into the reef at four minutes after midnight . The captain was n't on the bridge and had been drinking alcohol earlier in the evening . Eleven of the ship 's cargo holds were punctured , and the first of 11 million gallons started filling Prince William Sound . The Valdez , roughly three American football fields long , eventually lost 20 percent of its cargo , although the exact figure was never known , since seawater flowing into the ship made it difficult to measure how much was left . The uncapped well in the Gulf has been spewing out around 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- a day . Cleaning up oil is tough at the beginning and gets harder every day . The first job is to contain a spill , a nearly impossible task in the real world . On the water , booms which absorb and contain spills on relatively calm seas can be used to herd it into big pools that can be sucked up or burned . Burning needs perfect conditions , and one engineer compared a siphon to a toothpick in the Gulf . Chemical dispersants which separate crude into fine droplets can be sprayed from ships and planes . Rusty-colored oil ` mousse ' can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico where dispersants mixed into the water by waves are breaking down the oil . Above all , the oil needs to be kept off shore , which over time is the most difficult thing to do . When oil hits land it 's often for a short visit -- dropping off a sheen and then moving with the tides up or down the shoreline . Eventually though , the oil ages , becoming a tar -- like a blob that gloms onto a surface and wo n't let go . That 's fine on a hard-packed sandy beach , which is the best place for an oil spill , since a careful lift of a thin layer of sand can get rid of most of the problem . But in marshes , new and old oil can spread thin and deep with a ferocity that makes any cleanup counterproductive -- boots kill more than the oil . Alaska 's rocky coast is somewhere in between the two extremes , and just where the risks lay , and what the risks involved , is still debated today . The threats to wildlife are legion . Fish eggs in water and turtle eggs on land can be fouled by oil . Growing fish mutate , otters and whales swimming through oil can get sick or suffocate from the fumes or oil coating their breathing passages . Petroleum fouls feathers , and small sea creatures can ingest chemicals and die . How that affects the environment is still being studied . Do tiny sea creatures eat the tiny droplets of oil , creating a food chain timebomb in the way that mercury levels concentrate in bigger fish ? Researchers say they do n't know or disagree . The Southern Shrimp Alliance in the Gulf Coast fears just such long term effects . The experts converging on Alaska had seen hundreds of spills . Two decades later , they agree on one thing with regard to Exxon Valdez : the first three days were lost . Al Maki , Exxon 's chief scientist at the time , flew in early and knew what to do : break up the oil with chemical dispersants . The chemicals , which are being used widely in the current Gulf spill crisis , break oil into fine droplets so that it can be absorbed into the water and degrade naturally . Warm water and wave action speed the mixing and energy . `` If we had a chance to use dispersants earlier in the game , it would have reduced the landing impact substantially , '' said Maki . Exxon , which was in charge of the cleanup , was n't allowed to use dispersants for three critical , calm days , after the early Friday crash , he said . `` The storm that came through on Sunday night moved the oil way out beyond our reaches and the use of dispersants was canceled , '' he said . Kelso remembers the early days differently , though his conclusion is the same . `` The window of opportunity to move as much oil out of the water as possible was squandered , '' he said . Exxon , which had relied on an unreliable contractor to prepare for the spill , was scrambling in the first few days . Dispersants were n't at hand , and a trial of them was a flop in the cold , still water , he said . Conflicts over dispersants were one of the first between the main players in the cleanup -- state authorities like Kelso , Exxon leaders like Maki , and the federal government , including John Robinson , the chief scientist at the spill for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Robinson remembers two years of animosity and contention , a management problem that contributed to the oil spill issue -- and which was dealt with directly by legislation the following year that gave the federal government clear authority to step in and take charge of a spill response , as it has done on the Gulf Coast . The state was so unhappy , `` it was difficult for them to agree to almost anything in terms of the approach to cleanup , '' Robinson , now retired , said by phone . The storm which swept through three days after the crash totally changed the game , making it a desperate attempt to keep oil away from sensitive areas and muster resources . A state report compared the work to `` guerrilla warfare . '' An obvious solution to too much oil is to send it up in flames . `` People think you just light a match , '' said Stan Jones , spokesman for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council , a commission that monitors tanker and marine safety operations in Prince William Sound and was established by Congress in response to the Exxon Valdez . `` Burning 's just not that easy , '' he said . Some 15,000 gallons burned in about 75 minutes in one attempt the day after the spill . But others proved futile . Little seemed to be happening the day after the spill , and Exxon panicked at the lack of clear action . `` Kick ass and get stuff out there . I do n't care what it is . I do n't care if it picks up two gallons -LRB- of oil -RRB- a week . Get that shit out there and stand it around where people can see it , '' executive Don Cornett said , according to a transcript of an audio tape of Cornett gathered for a 1994 trial on the spill . Frustrated fishermen took to the seas , marshaling what they called the `` mosquito fleet '' of skiffs and small boats loaded with buckets and hand-skimmers that launched off a state ferry press-ganged into service . There was no incident command system , the standard hierarchy that is used for responses to natural disasters and is now automatically activated to respond to oil spills . `` Early in the oil spill , no one was in charge and everyone was in charge , '' said R.J. Kopchak , a longtime Cordova commercial fisherman and development director for the Prince William Sound Science Center . `` It was sort of a spontaneous , grass-roots response where people saw that the oil-company response was n't working , '' said Rick Steiner , a marine scientist and former Cordova fishermen who was part of the effort . `` Some boats got booms . Some just got buckets . '' A salmon fishery was saved and a good 100,000 gallons of oil picked up in the home-made effort . Exxon coordinated with the group , and Kelso says it shamed the oil giant into action . The oil kept spreading . In four days it was 37 miles from the spill site . In two weeks it was 150 miles . By day 56 , a sheen of crude stretched 470 miles . But two months in , guerrilla warfare had turned into a corporate campaign . Exxon had mobilized in full . Some 11,000 workers were washing rocks , first with rags and then with power hoses . The main plan was to float the oil off the beaches . Since oil floats , flooded beaches would shed the oil , which could be caught at the waterline . The main problem was that by this time the oil was tar , stuck to rock , and was n't going to move that easily . `` This stuff became much more difficult to deal with plastered on the rocks than it was the first few days . and that is what led us to deal with it with the hot water , '' NOAA 's Robinson remembers , describing the decision to rely heavily on high pressure hot water to wash the rocky beaches . `` The cleanup in Alaska did n't get started for a couple of months , started in a serious way , '' he said . `` We eventually had to have about 10,000 people and several ships and support facilities and all the wherewithal to make hot water and deliver it to the coast . And that was a couple of months before that arrived , at least , '' he said . It was more than a big effort though . It was a big mistake , Robinson said . `` The aggressiveness of the cleanup in the end contributed to more damage than the oil did , '' he believes . Nine strips of beach were left untouched as an experiment , and those nine beaches look better today than the swept ones , where whatever was alive was cooked to death in superhot water . Maki , the Exxon scientist , disagrees . Beach denizens -- mussels , clams , worms -- indeed were killed off by the washes , but birds could nest , seals could raise pups on the cleared beaches , sea otters ' chances of survival rose . `` When you look at the hot water or warm water wash from a net environmental standpoint for all the species , it was a benefit , '' he said . Exxon also put fertilizer on beaches far and wide , calculating that naturally existing microbes that eat naturally seeping hydrocarbons would multiply with the fertilizer and munch up the oil , which many said was indeed the case . Maki is in the Gulf today , so far as an observer and potentially as a consultant . The differences are stark , he believes . Dispersants are breaking up the oil far from land , weather has been good , keeping the oil at sea up to now , and the land oil may come to is a different world -- marshes and stretches of white , packed sand that lets oil rest on the surface , not rocks that oil slips down between . That is not to say a white sand beach is easy to clean . The key to such an effort is to wait until all the oil has arrived , skim it and a little sand off with a shovel , and be done . But oil moves with tides , so the perfect time to clean is a moving target . Volunteers can easily dig too deep , or not deep enough . Heavy equipment works faster but can damage the beach . And so a simple one-two exercise can become a seemingly endless process that is repeated until there is no beach left . More than 20 years after Valdez , there is hardly any difference in the tools available for cleanup , and very little research has been done to solve the question that divides Robinson and Maki -- what is the least of the evils ? The answers are mostly in studies that Environmental Scientist Nancy Kinner of University of New Hampshire calls ` gray literature ' -- funded by either the oil industry or environmental groups , and thus suspect . Take the case of dispersants . There is broad agreement that they can be used in the warm waters of the Gulf , she said , but Alaska ? `` I do n't know and I 'm pretty sure from looking at the literature that other people do n't know either . They may they claim they do but again it 's a matter of the quality of these studies , '' said Kinner , who is co-director the Coastal Response Research Center , a joint effort between the university and NOAA . Funding for a great new generation of inquiry , studies that would answer , for instance , whether dispersed droplets of oil disappeared or collected in tummies of microbes eaten by shrimp , never happened . Congress authorized studies in the 1990 law which followed on the Exxon Valdez disaster , but it never approved the funds to carry out them out , she said . Oil still lingers on some Alaska beaches , in surprisingly fresh condition . NOAA estimates that about 21,000 gallons of oil are buried in beaches . `` There 's more oil out there , in larger quantities and in a more toxic state , than we thought there would be , '' said Craig Tillery , Deputy Attorney General of Alaska . Exxon spent billions on the cleanup , which Erich Gundlach , an engineer who consulted on the Valdez spill , still marvels at . `` The line was -- we did n't tell Exxon but -- thank God it was Exxon . The state could n't do it . '' Crude from Alaska 's north still comes down the pipeline , and Royal Dutch Shell is on the cusp of drilling exploratory wells in pristine , remote territory of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas . Today , a small beach at the end of a narrow cove on Prince William Sound 's Eleanor Island , a site hit heavily by Exxon oil in 1989 , presents an iconic Alaska scene of natural beauty . On a recent visit , a bald eagle flew overhead . The air was scented with kelp , clinging to beach cobbles , and fresh water rushed from a stream in the spruce forest down into the sound . Snowy peaks glitter nearby . Dave Janka has been searching beaches like this for oil since the cleanup was declared officially complete in 1992 . His oldest daughter , who was 3 years old at the time of the spill , wound up riding along while Janka took scientists and others around the sound . He remembers her playing with a toy rod and toy fish . `` She 'd bring it up onto the boat and say , ` Oh , it 's dead , it got oil on it , ' '' he said . Two decades of his samples rest in jars on display at the Prince William Sound Science Center , headquartered in a cozy building at the end of a pier in Cordova Harbor , where the local fishing fleet is based . On the recent visit , Janka plunged a shovel into the beach surface . Globs of dark brown oil surrounded by reflective sheen emerged , emitting a headache-inducing odor . `` Looks like oil . Smells like oil , '' said Janka . `` Right from the start of the spill , you did n't want to see it , and then to be here 21 years later and still be seeing it ... '' He paused . `` It gets old . It really does . '' -LRB- Editing by Jim Impoco and Claudia Parsons -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The companies are BP Plc -LRB- BP . L -RRB- , the British company backing drilling at the Macondo well , Anadarko Petroleum -LRB- APC . N -RRB- , which owns a 25 percent state in Macondo , Transocean -LRB- RIG . N -RRB- , the owner of the rig that burned down , Cameron International -LRB- CAM . N -RRB- , manufacturer of the blowout preventer and Halliburton -LRB- HAL . N -RRB- , which had just completed the cementing of the production casing , the agency said in a note . `` The environmental liabilities and legal costs facing these five companies involved in the Macondo drilling project will put negative pressure on their credit profiles , '' said Steven Wood , Managing Director of the Oil and Gas\\/Chemicals team at Moody 's . `` Although the monetary liability and long-term credit effects remain unclear , all five companies face reputational risk , '' he said . BP is likely to take the brunt of the liability although it is too early to assess its exposure as the spill continues , he said . `` The magnitude of the spill could place BP under some credit pressure , but how much -- and whether it will affect the company 's long-term credit rating -- remains unclear , '' said the analyst . `` The accident has compelled us to revise our outlook on BP 's ratings to negative from stable , however . '' Anadarko was not the operator at Macondo , and unlike BP it was insured against accidents . But it 's likely to share in well-repair and clean-up costs , he said . Transocean has about $ 1.6 billion in insurance , and has already collected most of the cost of its destroyed rig -- over $ 400 million , said Wood . A greater threat to the company is that new regulations and laws stemming from the high-profile accident could hurt its business model in the long term , he said . Insurance may limit the liability of the other two companies involved , Cameron International and Halliburton . `` The impact on both companies is also buffered by strong liquidity , adequate insurance , and a limited degree of responsibility for the well , '' said Wood .

The four-story structure , the best short-term hope of controlling the spewing crude , was lowered to the seabed almost one mile below the surface in an attempt to funnel the escaping oil to a surface tanker . BP , which faces major financial losses from the spill , suffered a further blow when ratings agency Standard & Poor 's lowered its outlook on the British oil giant to negative from stable . It is under pressure from the Obama administration to limit the damage from what could be the worst oil spill in U.S. history . BP has said it will pay all legitimate costs , a bill that is likely to run into the billions of dollars . BP officials hope the container will begin funneling oil from the leak next week . Workers will spend the next three to four days making the connections to pump crude to the surface . The device has not been tried at that depth , where engineers guiding remotely operated vehicles battle darkness , currents and intense undersea pressure . BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward warned there was no certainty of success . `` The pressures and temperatures are very different here , so we can not be confident that it will work , '' Hayward told CNN . BP is drilling a relief well to halt the leak -- which began after the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 , killing 11 crew members -- but it could take up to three months to complete . Engineers have also considered pumping heavy fluids into the top of the failed blowout preventer to plug the leaking well in a technique called `` top kill . '' They gave up on efforts to close valves on a failed blowout preventer with underwater robots , after trying in vain for two weeks , Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said . Surface containment efforts continue , helped by calm seas . Controlled burns on Thursday removed up to 9,000 barrels -LRB- 280,000 gallons\\/1 ,070,000 liters -RRB- of oil , he said . It `` is a very powerful technique and when the weather is good it will continue , '' Suttles said . Forecasts suggest light winds through Saturday , although they are expected shift and come from the south to southwest , which could push the slick toward the Louisiana shore . About 250 boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the thick oil on Friday . Crews have laid almost 800,000 feet of boom , and spread 267,000 gallons -LRB- 1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant . On Thursday , after meeting with BP executives in Houston , U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the company and its partners made `` some very major mistakes . '' Salazar reiterated the U.S. government will issue no new offshore drilling permits until an inter-agency panel gives a safety review to President Barack Obama by May 28 . In the meantime , current drilling will continue . Standard & Poor 's , in announcing the negative outlook , indicated a ratings downgrade was likely . Moody 's said the spill raised the specter of credit pressure for the five primary companies involved in the project . S&P cut its outlook for Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which has a 25 percent stake in the ill-fated well , to stable from positive , saying it is `` potentially liable for significant costs and liabilities relating to the clean-up . '' Other companies involved are Transocean , owner of the rig that caught fire and collapsed ; Cameron International , which supplied the failed blow-out preventer for the well ; and Halliburton , which helped cement in place the blown-out well . Hayward a $ 75 million legal cap on its cleanup and compensation liabilities under federal law , which some U.S. lawmakers now want to raise , would not be a limit for BP . BP shares dropped 2.3 percent in London on Friday , less than the broad STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index which fell 3.8 percent . In New York , BP 's American Depository Receipts sank 2.7 percent . The spill threatens an economic and ecological disaster on tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . It has forced Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling . At least 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have poured into the Gulf each day since the well ruptured . A sheen of oil has engulfed much of the Chandeleur Islands , barrier islands that are part of Louisiana 's Breton National Wildlife Refuge , the first confirmation of the oil slick hitting land . Some oiled birds have been found in recent days . The Breton refuge was closed to the public after a silver sheen and emulsified oil reached the shoreline , the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said . Altogether , crude from the spill could hit 24 national wildlife refuges . A Reuters photographer , on a flyover of the coast , saw a band of oil , orange in color and about a mile or two long , running parallel to shore about 17 miles south of barrier islands off Mississippi 's mainland . Numerous black blobs , possibly emulsified tar , were visible just below the surface in shallow water near some marsh coast to the east of the Chandeleur Islands . U.S. authorities on Friday modified and expanded the boundaries of the area closed to fishing as a result of the spill , and extended restrictions for another 10 days , to May 17 . The closed area represents almost 4.5 percent of Gulf of Mexico federal waters , up from slightly less than 3 percent included in the original ban . `` This oil spill was the last thing we needed , '' Lance Nacio , a shrimper with Anna Marie Seafood in Dulac , Louisiana , said on a call with reporters . `` I think this is going to devastate the industry which was already tattered by low dockside prices . '' Kevin Begos , a seafood industry spokesman in Apalachicola , Florida , said dealers in his area have seen orders drop . `` Right now , it 's mostly fear , because oil has n't come here yet , '' Begos said . Alabama tourism officials planned an ad campaign to let tourists know the beaches were still clean and encourage them not to cancel their vacation plans . Fears of massive shipping problems in the Gulf of Mexico have not panned out . Shippers and ports are prepared to clean vessels that move through the oily waters , but so far ships have passed through without contamination .

L -RRB- executive said on Saturday . BP officials are scrambling for a solution after methane hydrates stopped up the 98-ton containment dome as they were maneuvering it into place , Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , told reporters at a briefing in Robert . `` As we were placing the dome over the leak source a large volume of hydrates formed inside the top of the dome , requiring us to move the dome to the side of the leak point , '' Suttles said . `` I would n't say it 's failed yet . '' The four-story structure , BP 's only short-term hope of controlling the leak , is supposed to redirect the unchecked flow of crude from nearly one mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- below the water and , once connected , pump it to a surface tanker . If the dome plan fails , BP faces the prospect of drilling a relief well to cut off the leaky oil well , which could take two to three months . A giant oil slick from the gush of oil threatens to create an environmental disaster for four Gulf Coast states . Methane hydrates -- a slush of frozen hydrocarbons and water that form in the deep , cold conditions at the leak site -- began clogging up the opening in the dome , forcing them to set the structure aside , Suttles said . The dome is now resting on the ocean floor about 200 metres -LRB- 660 ft -RRB- from the leak source , and it could take 48 hours or more to find a workaround , Suttles said . Those could include using hot water to heat up the hydrates at the ocean floor , or using hydrocarbons like methanol to thin them out , Suttles said . Suttles said BP is mulling two other short-term fixes , including installing a new blow-out preventer on the leak site and trying to clog up the existing failed blow-out preventer with an injection of rubber and other solids , known as a `` junk shot . '' Hydrates are highly flammable and present a danger to BP workers on ships above the leak . If they dethaw in an uncontrolled manner , they could send a flood of natural gas to the top of the ocean surface and potentially ignite . Ironically , methane hydrates are a promising future energy source in themselves , but researchers are still searching for ways to safely harness them . A recent study by the Minerals Management Service pegged methane hydrate resources in the Gulf of Mexico at 21,000 trillion cubic feet of natural gas -- 100 times the country 's current proven supply . -LRB- Reporting by Erwin Seba , Writing by Chris Baltimore , Editing by Eric Walsh -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The region 's oyster beds are the vital foundation of a commercial and recreational fishing industry -- including shrimp , crabs and other shellfish -- that generates $ 6.5 billion in annual revenues , according to one recent estimate . The networks of reefs built up in shallow waters by these unassuming bivalves are like the Gulf of Mexico equivalent of the Caribbean 's coral reef system , only with oysters at the base of the pyramid instead of live coral . In addition to providing shelter and food for a complex web of undersea species , the way coral reefs do , oyster beds serve a number of other important functions by virtue of their proximity to land . `` It is not only the economic engine of this region , it is a real indicator of the environmental and ecological health of the Gulf Coast area , '' said Jamie Rappaport Clark , executive vice president of the conservation group Defenders of Wildlife and former head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . Oyster beds form undersea breakwaters that buffer shorelines and wetlands from erosion due to storm surge , helping preserve a habitat for birds and land animals . At low tide , exposed oyster banks themselves offer a feeding ground for some birds . And as filter feeders , oysters constantly strain the water of impurities for the estuaries , bays and marshlands that lie behind them , a characteristic that also makes the oyster reef particularly sensitive to contamination . Gulf fishery managers are bracing for the arrival of oil gushing from a ruptured undersea wellhead off Louisiana 's coast since April 20 , when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig under contract with BP Plc exploded . The blast killed 11 crew members , sank the rig and unleashed a spill that could eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska . The spill comes at a particularly bad time for oysters , coinciding with the peak season for oyster `` spat , '' the release of billions of tiny juvenile oysters the size of pepper flakes into the water , where they drift until those that survive settle onto a reef , attach themselves and grow to adulthood . The Gulf 's oyster beds are `` getting ready , like all other fisheries , to suffer a significant assault in the coming weeks , '' Clark said . `` And these filter feeders are the first lines of impact . '' A MARINE ECOSYSTEM MOST UNDER THREAT Various seabirds , like the brown pelican , which was taken off the endangered list last year , and five species of endangered sea turtles , all just starting to nest in the area , also are at high risk and are more visible to the public . But oysters are likely to be the region 's great unsung victims , whose destiny near the bottom of the food chain will be registered throughout the Gulf Coast marine environment . Although decades of water pollution , much of it runoff from farms , storm sewers and industry , has taken a toll on aquatic life along the U.S. Gulf Coast , the region still is home to the world 's last , largely intact network of oyster reefs . Compared with other types of marine ecosystems , oyster reefs on the whole are considered by scientists to be the most environmentally damaged globally , declining by 85 percent over the past several decades . The Chesapeake Bay along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard , for example , has lost 99 percent of its once-bountiful oyster beds , said Mike Beck , a senior marine scientist for the environmental group Nature Conservancy . With over half of its reefs still left , the Gulf Coast is the world 's `` last , best '' chance of maintaining a healthy oystery , Beck said . The Gulf Coast leads U.S. commercial oyster production , accounting for nearly 70 percent of a total national catch valued at $ 131.6 million in 2008 , the last year for which government figures are available . With the oil slick taking longer than first expected to reach the main coastal areas , fish and wildlife agencies have scurried to cordon off the most ecologically sensitive areas with containment booms they hope will minimize the damage . In Alabama , the spill poses a serious setback to efforts to enhance oysteries and other marine resources . The state recently launched an ambitious restoration program that includes temporary closure of its publicly owned oyster reefs and the relocation of 6 million pounds of oysters from upper Mobile Bay to other areas , said Chris Denson , a marine biologist at the state Conservation Department . Separately , the Nature Conservancy secured nearly $ 3 million in federal economic stimulus money to fund a pilot program to test three kinds of artificial reef structures along a salt marsh island near Mobile Bay . The project was more than half complete when it was put on hold due to the oil spill . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

BP engineers have moved the four-story containment dome -- which was seen as the best short-term way to stem the flow from a ruptured oil well -- off to the side on the sea floor and will take two days trying to come up with a solution , Doug Suttles , chief operating officer , told reporters . The problem is with gas hydrates , essentially slushy methane gas that would block the oil from being siphoned out the top of the box . As BP tries to solve it , oil keeps flowing unchecked into the Gulf in what could be the worst U.S. oil spill . `` I would n't say it 's failed yet . What I would say is what we attempted to do last night did n't work because these hydrates plugged up the top of the dome , '' Suttles said . `` What we 're currently doing , and I suspect it will probably take the next 48 hours or so , is saying , ` Is there a way to overcome this problem ? ' '' The company , under pressure from the Obama administration to limit the damage to the Gulf and coastlines of four states , expected hydrates , but not the volumes encountered after a crew lowered the dome nearly a mile to the sea floor . Possible solutions may involve heating the area or adding methanol to break up the hydrates , Suttles said . Officials had already warned there was no guarantee that the technology would work at such water depth . BP had spent the previous day or so lowering the 98-ton contraption to the well site with the aid of sensors , video cameras and undersea robots . It hopes to attach a pipe to the chamber to start pumping oil up to a tanker , with the aim of capturing about 85 percent of the leaking oil . The spill threatens an economic and ecological disaster targeting beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . It has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling .

Suttles said BP may now try to plug up the existing preventer or attach a new one on top of it . It also is drilling a relief well to halt the leak -- which began after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 crew members -- but it could take up to three months to complete . In the initial blast , a natural gas cloud enveloped the rig and exploded just as visiting BP officials were celebrating seven accident-free years in the rig 's crew quarters , according to accounts by survivors of the blast . According to transcripts of interviews obtained by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , a giant methane bubble rushed up the drill pipe and filled the air above the deck of the drilling platform with flammable gas , followed by a scalding flood of crude that spilled onto the drill deck and ignited . Nine workers on the drill deck were killed , along with two others working in the nearby mud storage room , Bea said . After several days of calm weather , winds began to pick up on Saturday , preventing controlled burns of the thickest concentrations of oil . Crews conducted five burns on Friday . Nearly 200 boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the thick oil on Saturday . Crews have laid almost 900,000 feet of boom , and spread 267,000 gallons -LRB- 1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant . In Bayou La Batre , the heart of Alabama 's seafood industry , the docks were largely quiet as thousands of shrimpers and seafood processors remained idled by fishing restrictions prompted by the oil spill . About 30 oyster-processing plants have run out of product and shut down , putting as many as 900 people out of work , said Wayne Eldridge , owner of J&W Marine Enterprises and an oyster plant operator himself . `` I 'm screwed , '' Eldridge said . `` The biggest thing is I 've got 35 people unemployed there .

An estimated 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have poured into the Gulf each day since the well ruptured . But Ian MacDonald , a biological oceanographer at Florida State University , said the estimate was much too conservative . The real flow rate from the undersea well , based on aerial images of the oil slick and estimates of the thickness of the oil itself , is probably closer to 25,000 barrels -LRB- 1.05 million gallons\\/4 million liters -RRB- per day , MacDonald told Reuters . A sheen of oil has engulfed much of the Chandeleur Islands , barrier islands that are part of Louisiana 's Breton National Wildlife Refuge , the first confirmation of the oil slick hitting land .

The spill is spreading west , further from Florida but toward the important shipping channels and rich seafood areas of the Louisiana shoreline , where fishing , shrimping and oyster harvesting bans have been widened . A state of emergency was declared in Lafourche Parish , Louisiana , with sheen , the leading edge of the oil slick , forecast to come ashore near Port Fourchon within days . BP is exploring several new options to control the spill after a buildup of crystallized gas in the dome forced engineers to delay efforts to place a massive four-story containment chamber over the rupture on Saturday . `` We 're gathering some data to help us with two things . One is another way to do containment , the second is other ways to actually stop the flow , '' BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles told Reuters in Venice , Louisiana . BP was also exploring ways to overcome the containment dome 's problem with gas hydrates -- slushy methane gas that would block the oil from being siphoned up to a waiting ship . `` People are working around the clock at BP headquarters , '' U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told National Public Radio . But conducting operations at depths of one mile below the surface was complicating the challenge . `` We 're actually dealing with a source that does n't have human access , '' Allen said . At least 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil a day have been gushing unchecked into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , rupturing the well and killing 11 crew members . On Dauphin Island , Alabama , a barrier island and beach resort , sunbathers found tar balls along a short stretch of beach . Experts were testing the tar to determine if it came from the Gulf spill . The spill , which could become the worst in U.S. history , threatens economic and ecological disaster on Gulf Coast tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds . It has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling . The disaster could slow the exploration and development of offshore oil projects worldwide , the head of the International Energy Agency warned . `` The future potential is offshore in deeper water and in the Arctic , so if offshore investment is going to be slowed down , that is a concern , '' IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka told Reuters . BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told London 's Sunday Telegraph it could be weeks or months before the spill is brought under control . He said the company could spend $ 10 million a day on clean-up efforts . BP may next try to plug the damaged blowout preventer on the underwater well by pumping debris into it at high pressure , a technique called a `` junk shot , '' or attaching a new preventer on top of it . `` They are actually going to take a bunch of debris -- some shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that -- and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up to stop the leak , '' Allen told CBS News . BP also is drilling a relief well to halt the leak but that could take three months . Hundreds of boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the oil again on Sunday . Crews have laid more than 900,000 feet of boom and spread 290,000 gallons -LRB- 1.1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant . Latest government forecasts show possible effects of the spill moving further west , toward Texas . `` With continued winds from the east , potential oil contacts could reach as far west as Point Au Fer Island by Wednesday , '' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said . Sheen is about eight miles off the coast of Port Fourchon , with heavy oil still some 28 miles offshore , said Charlotte Randolph , president of Lafourche Parish . `` We 're keeping a very close watch , deploying boom and closing some beaches , '' she said . Truckloads of sand are being delivered to Port Fourchon to fill large sandbags , which will be dropped by National Guard helicopters in five areas along the coast . Chett Chiasson , executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission , said access to the port is a major concern . `` If necessary , our current strategy is to place boom along Belle Pass in Bayou Lafourche to create a ` decontamination station ' for ingress and egress through the port , '' he said . In Alabama , BP-contracted workers in rubber boots and gloves laid down clusters of oil-absorbing synthetic fibers called pom-poms , erected storm fencing along the Dauphin Island beach and collected samples of the tar and water for testing . Gary Bratt , owner of Chaise N ' Rays Rentals , which rents recreational equipment on Dauphin Island , said the threat of the spill reaching shore was ruining his business . `` Our business is off 70 percent at this point , '' with potential vacationers canceling `` right and left , '' he said . Gulf Coast politicians echoed the public 's fears . `` If this gusher continues for several months , it 's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it 's going to get down into the Loop Current and that 's going to take it down into the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida , '' Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson told CNN . `` You 're talking about massive economic loss to our tourism , our beaches , our fisheries , very possibly disruption of our military testing and training which is in the Gulf of Mexico . '' Crews labored to cordon off the entrance to Alabama 's Mobile Bay with a containment boom fence to try to safeguard America 's ninth-largest seaport . Ships arriving at Southwest Pass , the deepwater entrance to the Mississippi River and New Orleans will be inspected to determine if they need cleaning . The spill 's only major contact with the shoreline so far has been in the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana , mostly a wildlife reserve . The next few days threatens wider contact . Louisiana officials closed more waters to fishing and shrimp and oyster harvesting as the slick edged westward . Shrimp harvesting is now banned from Freshwater Bayou on the central coast to Louisiana 's border with Mississippi . Some oyster beds west of the Mississippi River also are shut . Seafood is a $ 2.4 billion industry in Louisiana , which produces more than 30 percent of the seafood originating in the continental United States .

BP shares fell 1.1 percent at 4:29 a.m. ET , lagging a 2.5 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . The stock has lost 16 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire with the loss of 11 lives , wiping around $ 30 billion off BP 's market value . Analysts have offered forecasts for spill clean-up costs and compensation that range from a few hundred million dollars to $ 12.5 billion . BP 's latest figures show the lower estimates to be wildly optimistic but so far there is no indication the higher estimates will be exceeded . Until the end of last week , BP said the cleanup effort was costing $ 6 million\\/day . Over the weekend , BP suspended operations on a plan to cap the leak with a metal dome , due to problems with gas coming from the well . The company said it was investigating other possible options to cap the leak , while continuing to drill another well that it said was certain to stem the flow but which could take three months to complete . `` BP appears to be turning to more adventurous , and potentially more expensive , solutions , '' analysts at BOA Merrill Lynch said in a research note . The final bill is likely to be much higher than the $ 350 million figure announced on Monday as the well which caused the leak is still pumping at least 5,000 barrels per day of crude into the sea and the spill has yet to hit land . Only traces of oil have been reported on Gulf beaches so far and clean up costs will accelerate when major landfall occurs . Fishing has been impacted , prompting fishermen 's groups to lodge lawsuits for damages while others , including people in the tourism industry , have complained of losses due to the spill . Fishing and tourism damages could run into several billions of dollars , analysts said . The spill is expected to head westward next , suggesting the important shipping channels off the central Louisiana coast , west of the Mississippi Delta could be impacted . BP has said it would cover all `` legitimate '' claims for compensation . BP owns 65 percent of the well . Anadarko Petroleum owns 25 percent and Japan 's Mitsui owns 10 percent . All are liable for costs on a proportionate basis . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin ; Editing by Mike Nesbit and Louise Heavens -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Watkins\\/U . S. Navy\\/Handout ROBERT , Louisiana | Mon May 10 , 2010 7:25 pm EDT ROBERT , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc said on Monday it will again attempt to contain oil gushing deep in the Gulf of Mexico , this time with a far smaller funnel than it tried before , as a massive slick threatened Louisiana shores . With cleanup efforts in high gear , a blame game will unfold in Washington on Tuesday as executives from BP and two other companies involved , Transocean Ltd and Halliburton Co , appear before Senate panels probing the disaster . BP now aims to deploy a small `` top hat '' dome over the leak after its effort over the weekend to cover it with a huge metal box was stymied by a buildup of crystallized gas hydrates . Fears of a prolonged environmental and economic disaster for the Gulf Coast are growing after the setback for BP , which contracted the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded on April 20 , killing 11 people and triggering the spill . Delays in containing the leaking well increase the chances it could become the worst U.S. oil spill , surpassing the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Prince William Sound , Alaska . The new plan is to have an oil-barrel-sized container at the leak site , a mile down from the water 's surface , within 72 hours , BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said . Then oil would be siphoned up to a tanker . `` There will be less seawater in the smaller dome and therefore less likelihood of hydrate formation , '' he told reporters at the company 's U.S. headquarters in Houston . Hydrates , essentially slushy methane gas , clogged the top of the dome , preventing crude from being pumped . The projected westward spread of the massive slick it is creating has raised fears for rich fishery areas filled with shrimps , oysters , crabs and crayfish , and even on major shipping channels off the Louisiana coast . The company is also spraying chemical dispersants at the ruptured well , an operation Hayward said was showing some success . The well is spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil a day into the Gulf . It threatens tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds across four states and has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling . Other options BP is weighing to stem the flow of oil include trying to block the well 's failed blowout preventer with a `` junk shot '' of rubber or other materials , or fitting a new valve or preventer . It is also drilling a relief well , but that could still take 75 to 80 days to complete . In written testimony for Tuesday 's Senate hearings , a BP executive directs blame for the blowout at Transocean , the rig 's owner and overseer of the operation of the blowout preventer , a stack of pipes and valves designed to close off the flow of oil in case of a sudden pressure change . Transocean says the blowout preventer was not the cause , and instead points to failure of two other vital elements -- the well 's metal casing and the cement that entombed it . Halliburton , which had the cementing contract , had finished cementing the final casing in place 20 hours before the explosion , according to testimony . BP has incurred $ 350 million in costs so far from response , containment , relief well drilling and payments to Gulf Coast states , suggesting the final bill could be much higher than many analysts predicted . Hayward said an investigation into the incident will reveal what happened in the moments before the well blew out . It will likely also generate new measures to control blowouts . He rejected the notion that BP , one of the world 's largest oil companies , was ill-prepared to deal with such an incident . `` Frankly , it 's been far more effective than any spill response hitherto in terms of containment offshore and preventing oil from getting to the shore , '' he said . BP shares fell 0.9 percent at 1430 GMT , lagging a 4.8 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . The stock dropped as low as 540.7 p in London , its lowest level since November . BP 's American Depositary Receipts fell 0.5 percent in New York . The stock has fallen by around 15 percent since the rig blast , wiping around $ 30 billion from BP 's market value . The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port -LRB- LOOP -RRB- , the nation 's only deepwater oil terminal located southwest of New Orleans , said vessel movements were unaffected so far . The slick 's major contact with the shoreline so far has been in the unpopulated Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana , which is a mostly a wildlife reserve and bird sanctuary . At Breton Island in the Chandeleurs , crude is washing into a bird colony , said John Andrew , regional wildlife refuge chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . `` I am expecting it to get bad , '' he said . `` The birds are foraging into the water , into the sheen . They plunge for fish . Sheen is getting into their feathers and we are concerned about what happens when they return to the nest . '' The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said winds could push oil ashore in the Mississippi Delta , Breton Sound , the Chandeleur Islands and areas directly north . If the wind keeps blowing from the southeast , oil could reach as far west as Atchafalaya Bay by late on Wednesday , NOAA said . The two Louisiana parishes directly west of the Mississippi Delta declared states of emergency on Sunday . National Guard helicopters in Louisiana 's Lafourche Parish dropped sandbags onto outlying island beaches to try to block oil from getting into fragile marshlands . Tar balls washed up on Alabama 's Dauphin Island , a barrier island and popular beach resort , during the weekend and local tourism operators said vacation traffic had already slowed to a trickle because of fears of the spill 's impact . `` It makes me so sad . You take so many things for granted : a beautiful beach , fresh shrimp whenever you want it . It is so frustrating because there seems to be no answers for it , '' said Dauphin Island resident Joyce Carroll . Fishing is suspended in parts of the Gulf waters and much of the Louisiana coast . Many tourists have been scared away by reports of reddish , putrid water offshore , even though the coast is currently unaffected .

Marilyn Heiman , the former director of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Commission and now with the Pew group 's U.S. Arctic program , quoted the Shell exploration drilling plan as saying that a large oil spill , such as a crude oil release from a blowout , is extremely rare and not considered a reasonably foreseeable impact . Heiman said the U.S. Minerals Management Service ' s environmental assessment also dismissed the probability of this kind of blowout and spill as `` insignificant . '' A blowout at BP 's well off the Louisiana coast is the source of the oil spill there . Since the BP spill in the Gulf , the Minerals Management Service has asked Shell for additional safety information by May 18 , but that may not be enough to allay the environmental groups ' fears .

Also threatened is the heart of U.S. energy production , as a giant , unprecedented underwater leak spreads oil across the northern Gulf of Mexico , threatening areas from Florida to points west of the of the Mississippi River . President Barack Obama 's plans to widen offshore drilling have been suspended , and energy giant BP Plc faces another blow to its reputation and a multibillion-dollar bill for cleaning up the mess and paying damages . Below is a chronology of the spill and its impact : \\* April 20 , 2010 - Explosion and fire on Transocean Ltd 's drilling rig Deepwater Horizon licensed to BP ; 11 workers missing , 17 injured . The rig was drilling in BP 's Macondo project 42 miles southeast of Venice , Louisiana , beneath about 5,000 feet of water and 13,000 feet under the seabed . A blowout preventer , intended to prevent release of crude oil , failed to activate . \\* April 22 - The Deepwater Horizon rig , valued at more than $ 560 million , sinks and a five-mile long oil slick is seen . \\* April 23 - The U.S. Coast Guard suspends search for missing workers . \\* April 25 - The Coast Guard says remote underwater cameras detect the well is leaking 1,000 barrels of crude oil per day . The agency calls the leak a `` very serious spill '' that threatens ecosystems along the Gulf Coast . It approves a plan to have remote underwater vehicles activate a blowout preventer and stop leak , but the effort fails . \\* April 26 - BP 's shares fall 2 percent on fears the cost of cleanup and legal claims will deal the London-based energy giant a heavy financial blow . \\* April 27 - U.S. departments of Interior and Homeland Security announce joint investigation . Coast Guard says leaking crude may be set ablaze to slow the spread of oil in the Gulf . \\* April 28 - The Coast Guard says the flow of oil is 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- -- five times greater than first estimated . A controlled burn is held on the giant oil slick . \\* April 29 - Obama pledges `` every single available resource , '' including the U.S. military , to contain the spill , which Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says is of `` national significance . '' Obama also says BP is responsible for the cleanup . Louisiana declares state of emergency due to the threat to the state 's natural resources . \\* April 30 - An Obama aide says no drilling will be allowed in new areas , as the president had recently proposed , until the cause of the Deepwater Horizon accident is known . \\* BP Chairman Tony Hayward says the company takes full responsibility and will pay all legitimate claims and the cost of the cleanup . The Interior Department orders safety inspections of all 30 deepwater drilling rigs and 47 deepwater production platforms . \\* May 1 - Coast Guard says leak will affect the Gulf shore . \\* May 2 - Obama visits the Gulf Coast to see cleanup efforts first hand . U.S. officials close areas affected by the spill to fishing for an initial period of 10 days . BP starts to drill a relief well alongside the failed well , a process that could take two to three months to complete . \\* May 5 - A barge begins towing a 98-ton containment chamber to the site of the leak . BP says one of the three leaks has been shut off by capping a valve , but that would not cut the amount of oil gushing out . \\* May 6 - Oil washes ashore on the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast , uninhabited barrier islands that are part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge and important nesting and breeding areas for many bird species . \\* May 7 - BP engineers use undersea robots to move the containment chamber over the larger of the two remaining leaks on the seabed . A fishing ban for federal waters off the Gulf is modified , expanded and extended to May 17 . \\* May 8 - BP 's containment dome hits a snag when a buildup of crystallized gas forces engineers to postpone efforts to place the chamber over the oil leak and siphon oil to the surface . `` Tar balls '' suspected to come from the leak wash up along a half-mile stretch of Dauphin Island , Alabama . \\* May 9 - BP says it might try to plug the undersea leak by pumping materials such as shredded up tires and golf balls into the well at high pressure , a method called a `` junk shot . '' \\* May 10 - Forecasts suggest the oil spill could move significantly west of the Mississippi River delta as brisk onshore winds prevail . BP announces plans to place a small containment dome , known as a `` top hat , '' over the blown out well to funnel oil to the surface . \\* May 11 - Executives with BP , Transocean and Halliburton appear at congressional hearings in Washington , where Senators criticize their safety records . The executives blame each other 's companies for the explosion .

But Anne Drinkwater , president of BP Canada , offered few answers at a hearing at Parliament 's Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the safety of drilling in the Far North . Drinkwater , who has also run BP operations in Indonesia , Angola and Norway , declined to answer technical questions and said she had not compared Canadian and U.S. drilling regulations , straining the credulity of some on the committee . `` You 'd think coming to a hearing like this that British Petroleum would have as many answers as possible to assure the Canadian public . We got nothing today from them , '' said Nathan Cullen of the left-leaning New Democrats . `` I was very disappointed . I think British Petroleum is going to have to do a lot better job if they want to drill in Canadian waters , '' Cullen told reporters afterward . Larry Bagnell of the Liberals , after asking Drinkwater to compare regulations in Canada and the United States , said : `` I thought she did n't have answers to a lot of questions ... I was asking for a very simple answer . '' Critics say an oil blowout in the Canadian Arctic would be much worse than the current Gulf disaster , given the ice , severe weather conditions and the lack of infrastructure in one of the world 's most remote regions . In 2008 , BP paid C$ 1.2 billion -LRB- $ 1.8 billion -RRB- for rights to explore three parcels in Canada 's Beaufort Sea , north of the Arctic Circle . It has yet to announce plans to drill in the region but shortly before the U.S. disaster , BP and other oil companies urged Canadian regulators to drop a requirement stipulating that companies operating in the Arctic had to drill relief wells in the same season as the primary well . Cullen argued the companies had made this request because drilling a relief well within the required time limit would be too expensive , given the difficult Arctic conditions . `` It 's not a question of cost , '' said Drinkwater . `` Your submission does say it 's a question of cost . ... You cite money because you 're concerned about money , '' retorted Cullen , reading from a BP document filed with the NEB , then listing recent disasters BP had been involved in . Drinkwater -- who said BP was not rejecting the option of a relief well -- declined to answer reporters ' questions following the hearing . Canadian governments and regulators are reassessing the country 's preparedness for an offshore disaster following the April 20 explosion of Transocean Ltd 's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . The explosion killed 11 workers and triggered what could prove to be the worst U.S. oil spill if the crude keeps spewing unchecked into the Gulf . The National Energy Board , Canada 's federal oil and gas regulator , launched a review of Arctic safety and environmental drilling requirements this week and canceled hearings into the relief well issue . NEB Chief Executive Gaetan Caron said it was too early to say what the review might conclude . Asked whether a similar accident could happen in the Arctic , Caron replied : `` No safety regulator can possibly say that an accident will never happen . '' Provincial governments are also reviewing offshore drilling regulations . The government of Nova Scotia on Thursday extended a moratorium on oil and gas exploration on the Georges Bank , an important fishing region , by three years to the end of 2015 . The government of Newfoundland is also launching a review of offshore safety practices , though it said it is satisfied with the current level of environmental protection practiced by the industry . Indeed , Chevron Corp earlier this week began drilling a deepwater well in the Orphan basin off the province . The Atlantic off Newfoundland is home to Canada 's three producing oil projects .

The ubiquitous 5,000-barrels-a-day number seems to be a massive underestimate , and the stated reason for not getting a better figure is weak indeed : A spokesman , David H. Nicholas , said in an e-mail message that the estimated rate of flow would not affect either the direction or scale of our response , which is the largest in history . ... I think the estimate at the time was , and remains , a reasonable estimate , said Dr. Lubchenco , the NOAA administrator . Having greater precision about the flow rate would not really help in any way . We would be doing the same things . Why is the NOAA backing BP up on this ? Knowing the size of the problem may or may not help in terms of being able to fix this particular problem . But it 's certainly going to be important going forwards . What 's more , the current estimate could hardly have been friendlier towards BP if it had tried : The 5,000-barrel-a-day estimate was produced in Seattle by a NOAA unit that responds to oil spills . It was calculated with a protocol known as the Bonn convention that calls for measuring the extent of an oil spill , using its color to judge the thickness of oil atop the water , and then multiplying . However , Alun Lewis , a British oil-spill consultant who is an authority on the Bonn convention , said the method was specifically not recommended for analyzing large spills like the one in the Gulf of Mexico , since the thickness was too difficult to judge in such a case . Even when used for smaller spills , he said , correct application of the technique would never produce a single point estimate , like the government s figure of 5,000 barrels a day , but rather a range that would likely be quite wide . Why release a point estimate ? Well , if the NOAA had released a range -- say 3,000 to 30,000 barrels a day -- then the press would have gravitated to the higher number , and talked about a spill of `` as much as 30,000 barrels a day '' , and that would be the main number people remembered . But it 's not the NOAA 's job to do PR for BP . And it is the NOAA 's job to get as much good information about this oil spill as possible . So let 's get down there and measure this thing . BP has been slow and apathetic to the oil spill situation from the beginning . It took a week for it to wake up from its stupor and look for help on stopping the oil spilling for its rig in the Gulf of Mexico . Obama s visit and state and federal criticism has made it sit up . This is a classic case of lawyers , politicians and oil executives fighting it out for money and power , while the human costs mount for ordinary people . But perhaps it 's time to ask how much oil this well might contain , and potentially spew . its all part of the coverup ... same as the 300,000 gallons of toxic dispersants to keep it from reaching the surface ... Estimating the oil flowrate seems like a simple exercise . The diameter of the pipe is known , -LRB- and hence the flow area is known -RRB- and one should be able to reasonably estimate the velocity of the oil through the flow area . Just looking at the video , I would estimate the velocity around 5-6 feet\\/sec . Assuming that all the oil is flowing out of the pipe and no other opening and assuming the pipe is 3 inches in diameter , the flow rate can be calculated as 190,000 gallons per day -LRB- velocity V = 6 feet\\/sec -RRB- So the 200,000 gallons per day does not seem too far off . If all the oil is coming through the pipe , the only two variables needed to be estimated to calculate the flow rate is the diameter of the pipe and the velocity . An estimate of the diameter of the pipe of 3 inches seems reasonable , I have not seen too many drilling pipes larger than that . Also a velocity of 6 feet\\/sec also seems reasonable given the video and the fact that because frictional flow losses in a pipe varies with the velocity squared , one hardly ever encounters pipe velocites above 20 feet\\/sec . -LRB- A flow velocity of 20 feet\\/sec will produce -LRB- 20\\/6 -RRB- ^ 2 = 11.11 times the pipe friction losses of a velocity of 6 feet\\/sec -RRB- . high_al : all fine , except that the diameter of the well pipe is actually 9 inches . BP is doing more to stop offshore drilling than all the environmentalists put together Thnaks for the correction . -LRB- A 3 inch pipe did seem a little small -RRB- If it is 9 in , multiply the flow rate by 9 -LRB- -LRB- 9\\/3 -RRB- ^ 2 -RRB- . So instead of 5,000 barrels\\/day , the estimate goes to 45,000 barrels\\/day . Who the hell runs this country . I voted for President Obama and half the time he acts as if his head is up his arse . Whether it is the taking the financial industry to task , the commitment of troops in the Middle East or this ecological cluster % # \\* % , it seems he has a problem with aggressively expressing his authority as President of the United States . If I am not mistaken the territory where the oil spilled occurred is owned by the United States and the Interior Department has dominion . Then as the leader of the United States order a survey of the sub surface waters to determine the extent of the oil . IDIOTS !!!!!!! `` So let s get down there and measure this thing . '' Do you know anything about chemistry and physics ? Its not so easy , to just go down there and measure . First , the oil density changes at the point of release as it moves upward . Second , the oil is mixed with methane , water and there are reactions going on within the plume . While flow can be theoretically calculated , it must assume these variables . Also , its a mile deep , only robotic submersibles can go down there , and precisely measuring it as you envision , is secondary to stopping the oil flow . I think you really need to research the IXTOC I blowout . It is analogous to this incident , except it was far worse , with much higher flow rates , and final oil spill totals . Interestingly enough , compared to the total spill , very little oil washed up on beaches . Most settled to the sea floor , or dispersed . This appears to be similar , in that very little of the spill has actually washed ashore . So , the numbers dont really matter , only that the flow can be halted . Obama does n't have any incentive to actually get things right , as more and more problems come to light he can get his agenda of re-engineering the USA from a capitalist society production base pay with the elite producers to a society of Governmental control , nanny State society . All they really need is over 50 % of voters reliant on the Gov enough to favor a very large government to keep the machine in power and money to those it deems in favor at the time . As they say never let a disaster go to waste . Like now he is all over the Banks for misconduct but no mention of Freddie or Fannie Mae which is and was the worst waste and main contributor of or financial disaster . We will be in more hard times , and a double dip recession without a complete reversal of this agenda . Its already a trillion dollars wasted . BP has the resources to compensate those that were effected and clean the spill up . Right now they are bringing all these temporary fixes to keep public out cry from getting out of hand , there is only one true fix , is to drill another hole to plug this up . Which they are doing as we write , but will take 1-3 + months . `` But it s certainly going to be important going forwards . '' Ca n't you at least explain why this is so critical that it warrants your article ? Is n't such an explanation a reasonable expectation of someone attempting , even poorly , to make a point ? What is critical is containing the spill as soon as possible . Whatever is flowing now will continue to flow regardless of how accurately it 's captured in some entertainment article you wish to write . Or perhaps you 're seeking data for a future lawsuit . I do n't know . Is there any benefit to the environment of capturing an accurate flow rate for an impact that will not be understood for years ? For an impact that is clearly beyond mankind 's control at any depth and on any coastline , short of engineering an ocean floor containment solution ? How much are you willing to spend on getting this critical data point at the expense of containment efforts ? How do you propose doing it ? Where s the rocket scientist ? Please stop making stupid points . And keep that `` why '' business in mind next time . high_al at 11:07 am : `` An estimate of the diameter of the pipe of 3 inches seems reasonable , I have not seen too many drilling pipes larger than that . '' high_al at 3:42 pm : `` -LRB- A 3 inch pipe did seem a little small -RRB- '' nnniiiceee . . why do n't you just admit you have no clue what you 're talking about . I do n't really see how the actual flow rate is all that relevant . It 's not going to change the attack . BP will still be trying to contain the spill as quickly as possible . It 's not going to change the rate at which the relief wells are drilling to cut off the original well . Whatever number you assign to the flow is not going to change the current distribution of the oil on the surface . This is just another one of those non-issues that the media comes up with , each journalist trying to trump the other with a `` new angle . '' I agree with lucid . It 's not so easy to just go get the number . To accurately measure the rate , you need to isolate the flow such that none of it is leaking . You need to know how much natural gas and water are mixed with the oil . People who say these kinds of things , or who insist on a risk free world , have probably never taken a science course . high_al at 11:07 am : An estimate of the diameter of the pipe of 3 inches seems reasonable , I have not seen too many drilling pipes larger than that . high_al at 3:42 pm : -LRB- A 3 inch pipe did seem a little small -RRB- high_al : all fine , except that the diameter of the well pipe is actually 9 inches . The pipe is 21 inches wide . Where did 3 and 9 inches come from ? Gulf drillers ' official spill volume estimate appears about as accurate as other avoidable oil-related disasters e.g. civilian death tolls and real cost of waging America 's illegal wars on the Middle East . Along with methane and water there is probably dirt with heavy metals as well . Can someone explain why if you can see this pipe why you couldn t just crimp the end of it with some sort of Jaws of Life devise ? If it could contain it temporarily you might be able to secure some sort of dome over it . But if they did shut it off then they couldn t try to siphon off some it for more cash . Lock some people up and see how quickly they shut it off . `` Obama doesn t have any incentive to actually get things right , as more and more problems come to light he can get his agenda of re-engineering the USA from a capitalist society production base pay with the elite producers to a society of Governmental control ... '' rancher You make an interesting point . BPs new name is Beyond Petroleum . And they are aligned with money in the global warming agenda . As another example , Aetna asked for a 35 % increase in rates , just when the Health Care Bill was really hot . There have been quite a few coincidences during this administration . I find it ludicrous that this thing has not been fixed . I also find it odd that after so many off-shore well drillings that this happened in the first place . There are huge platforms in the North Sea that have been there for decades . That area makes the Gulf look like a swimming pool . `` But if they did shut it off then they couldn t try to siphon off some it for more cash . Lock some people up and see how quickly they shut it off . '' If they shut it off today , all that oil that 's now leaking off would remain in the wellbore and could be recoverable later . The oil that has leaked off is worthless . At a range of 5,000 to 20,000 barrels per day , that 's 120,000 to 480,000 barrels lost . At $ 80\\/barrel that 's $ 10 to $ 40 million they 've lost in oil revenues by not shutting it off immediately . In addition , all the lawsuits and cleanup costs ... Force some people to think for more than two minutes and you 'd see a lot fewer silly comments like this . `` I also find it odd that after so many off-shore well drillings -LRB- sic -RRB- that this happened in the first place . '' Do you also find it odd that after so many safe flights , a plane crashed last week ? Offshore drilling is a very high tech proposition in a dangerous environment , and you find human error to be evidence of a conspiracy ? : - -RRB- Oh boy . `` There are huge platforms in the North Sea that have been there for decades . '' The first platform in the Gulf of Mexico was built in 1947 , long before any wells were drilled in the North Sea . There are far more rigs in the Gulf than in the North Sea . The misinformation out there is amazing . All of the sudden , everyone 's an oil industry expert . alexhiggens : The riser pipe has a 20 inch interior diameter . However , the drill pipe that is actually sunk into the reservoir has a 9 inch diameter . That is the pipe that is relevant for determining flow . It 's possible that the pipe may be structurally compromised , or there may be frozen crystals built up , etc. which would affect oil flow . Also , as the oil rises through the pipe , methane gas comes out of suspension as pressure lessens -LRB- like the carbonation in soda -RRB- , so it 's tough to know how much is gas and how much is oil . That said , the pipe into the well is 9 inches . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Nearly 100 lawsuits have already been filed across the Gulf region , and the disaster , which lawyers envision becoming one of the biggest class actions in U.S. history , involves billions of dollars in potential liabilities . `` This is not just an environmental disaster , this is a legal disaster , Alabama Attorney General Troy King told reporters on Wednesday . `` It seems clear that this one will eclipse the Exxon Valdez payout , '' said Zygmunt J.B. Plater , who chaired a legal task force for a special commission in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill there in 1989 . `` The hit in terms of economics is going to be measurable and it 's going to be greater , '' said Plater , a law professor at Boston College , who noted that the population and levels of investment along the Gulf coast dwarfed those at stake in remote Alaska more than 20 years ago . BP is the most exposed to potential damages in the case . The London-based oil giant is the owner of the ruptured undersea well spewing out oil at an unchecked rate of about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- per day . The resulting oil slick threatens fisheries , beaches and wildlife refuges -- and livelihoods -- along the Gulf Coast . Other companies involved in the spill include Transocean Ltd , owner of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig licensed to BP , and Halliburton Co , which provided a variety of services on the rig and was involved in cementing the well to stabilize its walls . Families of some of the 11 workers who died in the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig blast have filed wrongful-death claims , and people who were injured have also taken legal action . The companies also face lawsuits brought by fishermen , restaurants , charter boat companies , hotels and rental property owners . Gulf Coast states could also sue , as could municipalities , for lost tax revenues , and shipping companies if traffic into major ports or the Mississippi River is disrupted . `` You 're talking about the entire economic structure of five states and all their ancillary businesses , '' said Tim Howard , a Tallahassee lawyer who last week filed one of Florida 's first class-action suits over the oil spill . `` You 're talking maybe about close to a half a trillion dollar economy here , '' Howard added . `` This is why you do not mess around and play around with something toxic . '' BP 's shares have been pummeled since the accident , wiping about $ 30 billion from its market value . The company has said repeatedly that it takes responsibility for the oil spill and will pay any legitimate damage claims . BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward has said that includes interrupted business activity . BP declined to comment on Wednesday on the number of lawsuits it now faces in connection with the spill . But it moved last week to have what it then described as `` at least 70 suits '' consolidated in a court in Houston , the U.S. oil hub which also serves as the command center for teams directing the oil spill clean-up efforts . In its appeal to a judicial panel that will decide which court is best equipped to hear the cases , BP also took the unusual step of asking that Houston Judge Lynn Hughes , appointed to the federal bench by former President Ronald Reagan , handle the multi-district `` It 's a little unusual for the defendants in massive litigation to request a judicial panel to send them to a particular court with a particular judge , '' said Brent Coon , a lawyer who spearheaded civil action against BP after the 2005 explosion at its Texas City refinery , which killed 15 workers . `` It certainly raises some red flags for some people , '' added Coon , whose firm is representing a survivor of the rig explosion suing BP , Transocean and Halliburton , among others . `` BP 's blueprint -LRB- is -RRB- saying that they 're transparent when in fact they 're not ; saying that they accept responsibility when in fact they 're already pointing their finger at the other guys , '' Coon said . A lawsuit brought against BP by one of its own shareholders , who alleged the company helped cause the Gulf spill by putting profit before safety , was dropped by the plaintiff on Tuesday without any explanation from lawyers . But the move may offer little solace to BP . `` The number of cases is going to increase dramatically , '' said Robert Gordon , an attorney with New York law firm Weitz & Luxenberg , which is representing 500 Gulf area commercial fisherman in the oil spill litigation .

Did Salazar make a mistake with Cape Wind and Oil ? Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary E. Landry told us early on in the Gulf spill `` there is no leak .

On April 27 , 2003 , eight years ago the Bouchard Barge B-120 hit an obstacle in Buzzards Bay , creating a 12-foot rupture in its hull and discharging an estimated 100,000 gallons of No. 6 oil .

Storms may scuttle clean-up efforts , force containment vessels to retreat , or propel spilled crude and tar balls over vast expanses of sea and beach , scientists said . Meteorologists say that climate conditions are ripe for an unusually destructive hurricane season , the storm-prone period that runs from June 1 to the end of November in the Gulf . Oceanographers say that could hurt the clean-up . `` If a storm comes into this situation it could vastly complicate everything , '' said Florida State University oceanography professor Ian MacDonald . `` All efforts on the shoreline and at sea , the booms and structures and rigs involved in clean-up and containment , could stop working . '' As thousands of spill responders gird for a clean-up that could last for months or years after the leaking well is capped , weather and ocean currents are emerging as major unknowns , raising anxiety levels , economic and environmental stakes in the Gulf as storm season nears . Compounding the uncertainty is how little research has been done on how storms affect oil spills . Some believe storm surges may help disperse the oil off shore or break down the slick . Other research suggests the oil slick itself could keep storms from gathering strength . Recent Atlantic Basin readings showed water temperatures up to 0.8 degrees Celsius above normal , and near a record high for the season . El Nino , which creates wind shear that can prevent Gulf hurricanes from forming , has recently subsided . The factors could spur major storms in the Gulf this year . `` It only takes one storm to wreak havoc , '' said Chris Shabbot , a meteorologist at Sempra in Connecticut . `` The consensus forecast is for above average storm activity as the El Nino -LRB- event -RRB- decays and the Atlantic is as warm or warmer than 2005 . '' Colorado State University 's renowned team of forecasters is calling for an above-average hurricane season that may bring 15 named storms this year , eight of hurricane strength . Accuweather 's Joe Bastardi also fears a destructive season . `` I hate to say it since the oil spill is already affecting people , but I think this hurricane season is going to be big , '' he said in an interview . The next official hurricane season outlook from the government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is due on May 20 . Miles and miles of booms have been placed offshore along the Gulf Coast to help stop the slick from making landfall . Amid the menacing forecasts , oceanographers and spill-responders are considering how storms and deep ocean currents would affect the movement of spilled oil , which authorities say could soon hit land in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama or Florida . The U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico spans some 1,680 miles . The spill , gushing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day from a subsea oil well 50 miles south of Louisiana , has formed a thin oil slick that covered more than 1,200 square miles in late April , according to Louisiana State University researchers . The slick has been harder to define this month , and may be shrinking , LSU professor Nan Walker said . Lurking under the sea surface , viscous tar balls are forming , facilitated by wave activity , as the heavier hydrocarbon molecules gradually sink toward the sea-floor , a process that can take months , scientists said . Experts are having trouble modeling how the oil will react in water since BP has n't disclosed exactly what kind of crude is spilling . Lighter oil evaporates quicker and is more easily dispersed by chemicals . Heavier crude can be more damaging to marine or bird life , but it could sink faster or be easier to contain . As many as 520 vessels are already responding to the spill throughout the Gulf , according to U.S. authorities . Efforts to stop the spill involve drilling relief wells from a seaborne rig , which BP says could take three months . The company is also trying to cap the leak with a metal funnel on the sea-floor , to gather oil into a giant hose connected to a storage ship above . Both of those efforts could be disrupted by tropical storms , which can force evacuation of oil and gas rigs throughout the Gulf . Peter Niiler , an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution in San Diego , has researched how even winds caused by a low pressure cycle can displace floating scientific buoys from waters near Florida to Texas in less than a week . `` Anything on the ocean surface , including oil , can move very fast and just about anywhere that wind or currents push it , '' Niiler said . The oil slick might even reach waters and shores abroad , scientists and foreign authorities warned this week . Mexican officials say if the spill persists into the fall it could reach Mexican beaches along the country 's Gulf Coast , the site of famed tourist destinations like Cancun . Some of the spilled crude should make its way into the LOOP current , a deep ocean stream that transfers heat from the tropics to higher latitudes and becomes the Gulf Stream . `` If you look at it , the LOOP current could lead that oil right to Havana , Cuba , '' said Florida State 's MacDonald . After sweeping near Havana , the LOOP current continues toward the Florida Keys and the Gulf Stream heads up the U.S. Eastern Seaboard . Some researchers said a wider dispersion of the spill may be good , and storms could help that process along . Researchers at NOAA , in a report last week , said the oil slick may also help to impede storm formation by preventing heat transfer from sea to air . `` There are two important issues here : the effect of hurricanes on the spill , and the effect of the spill on hurricanes , '' said Doron Nof , professor of oceanography at Florida State University . `` I think what a hurricane would do is break up the oil spill , making it even harder to clean up , '' he said .

Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , said on Saturday he obtained transcripts of interviews from three rig workers familiar with the explosion , including two who were in the rig 's crew quarters at the time . HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- For Louisiana 's young Republican governor , a massive oil spill lurking off his state 's fragile coast is another chance to show his skills as a detail-oriented manager and position himself for the national political stage . State political experts say Bobby Jindal , the 38-year-old son of Indian immigrants , is maneuvering for a possible run against Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu in 2014 . Jindal has dismissed such speculation and insists he is focused on getting re-elected in 2011 . HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- The outer edge of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico washed up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana coast on Friday , as efforts redoubled to avert what could become one of the worst U.S. ecological disasters . The last flight by a Coast Guard plane on Thursday had situated the thin surface `` rainbow sheen '' of the slick just 10 metres -LRB- 33 feet -RRB- from the Pass-a-Loutre wildlife reserve in Louisiana .

HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- The U.S. government ratcheted up efforts to avert an environmental disaster as a massive oil slick leaking from a ruptured well moved closer to the mouth of the Mississippi River on Thursday , menacing the delicate coastline of Louisiana and three other Gulf states . President Barack Obama pledged to `` use every single available resource '' and the U.S. military was mobilizing to help contain the spreading spill from the deepwater leak in the Gulf of Mexico . HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- A massive oil slick from a blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach a wildlife reserve at the mouth of the Mississippi River on Thursday as it threatens the environmentally delicate coastline of Louisiana and three other Southern U.S. states . President Barack Obama pledged to `` use every single available resource '' -- including the U.S. military -- to help the London-based energy giant BP Plc fight the crude oil spill , which was about 3 miles from the marshes of the Mississippi Delta and spreading faster than expected toward the shoreline , according to the Coast Guard . HOUSTON , April 29 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- A massive oil spill expected to hit the southern U.S. coast on Friday could affect petroleum shipments and delay plans to open up coastal waters to more drilling , government officials said on Thursday . The spill -- from a BP Plc <BP.L> rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico last week -- is spewing five times more oil than previously estimated and raising fears of severe damage to fisheries , wildlife refuges and beaches in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . `` This is a spill of national significance , '' Janet Napolitano , the secretary of Homeland Security , told a news conference at the White House . `` We will continue to push BP to engage in the strongest response possible . '' The governor of Louisiana , which is still recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , declared a state of emergency and the U.S. military said it was reviewing how it might help the efforts to contain the growing slick . Shares in London-based BP and Swiss-based rig company Transocean Ltd <RIGN.S> <RIG.N> fell by more than 6 percent on Thursday as investors feared a significantly higher cleanup cost . BP is down more than 10 percent and Transocean is down nearly 14 percent since the rig explosion on April 20 . Shares of oilfield services companies Cameron International Corp <CAM.N> and Halliburton Co <HAL.N> tumbled on fears about their ties to the Deepwater Horizon rig . Cameron , which supplied the blowout preventer for the rig , said on Thursday it was insured for $ 500 million of liability , if needed . Halliburton said it did a variety of work on the rig and was assisting with the investigation . The slick will hit the coast in the Mississippi Delta `` sometime later tomorrow , '' Sally Brice OHare , rear admiral of the Coast Guard , said at the news conference with Napolitano . President Barack Obama said BP was ultimately responsible for the cost of the cleanup and that his government would use every resource to address the spill . The White House said Obama has been briefed on how the slick may interfere with shipping channels , which could affect tankers delivering petroleum to the U.S. market . It may also have ramifications for proposals in Congress and by Obama to issue new offshore drilling permits . Initial indications were that the spill would be worse than one in the Pacific Ocean off Santa Barbara in 1969 which prompted a moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts , a ban Obama has said he wants to modify . The Obama administration did not rule out imposing a pause in new deepwater drilling until oil companies can show they can control any spills that may happen . `` Everything is on the table , '' Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes told reporters , adding it could take 90 days to install a relief valve to stop the leak . Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the rig disaster , the worst in the United States in almost a decade . Transocean 's Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 , two days after it exploded and caught fire while the company was finishing a well for BP about 40 miles -LRB- 64 km -RRB- southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River . The daily leak from the well blowout is now estimated at 5,000 barrels or about 210,000 gallons -LRB- 795,000 litres -RRB- . The Navy said it was supplying the Coast Guard with inflatable booms and seven skimming systems . BP and the Coast Guard have mounted what the company calls the largest oil spill containment operation in history , involving dozens of ships and aircraft . But they are struggling to control the slick from the leaking well 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,525 metres -RRB- under the sea off Louisiana 's coast . After underwater robots failed to activate a cutoff valve to stop the leak , BP and the Coast Guard set a `` controlled burn '' on Wednesday to try to prevent the slick from growing . `` We will not rest until we have done everything to bring this under control , '' said Andrew Gowers , head of group media for BP , likening the spill 's consistency to `` iced tea '' with the thickness of a human hair . `` Chris has been a journalist for Reuters since 2001 , when he joined the Washington DC bureau as a summer intern .

The opinions expressed are his own . - Last month s explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig continues to result in the leakage of an estimated 200,000 gallons -LRB- 910,000 litres -RRB- of oil into the Gulf of Mexico each day . According to U.S. President Barack Obama , we are dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster . While the leak is extremely serious , and Obama s words may ultimately ring true , the leak is -LRB- as yet -RRB- not one of the top 50 biggest oil spillages from either oil rigs or tankers in historical perspective : cents Some 7-10 ,000 tonnes of oil are so far estimated to have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico from Deepwater Horizon . cents The Exxon Valdez leaked some 36,000 tonnes of crude oil on the shores of Alaska . cents The largest ever off-shore leakage of oil occurred in 1979 in the Ixtoc-1 spillage when an estimated 476,000 tonnes of oil polluted the Gulf of Mexico -LRB- Bay of Campeche -RRB- . cents The biggest ever on-shore spillage occurred in the aftermath of the 1991 Iraq War when an estimated 1.4 to 1.5 million tonnes was released in Kuwait by Iraqi military forces . Most at risk from the Deepwater Horizon spill are the coastlines of Texas , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , and Louisiana , including the wetlands near New Orleans where millions of migratory birds are currently nesting , and fish spawning . The oil spill could also be catastrophic for the Gulf Coast s substantial seafood industry , including oysters and shrimp . To mitigate the environmental impact , measures will continue to be taken to prevent as much of the oil as possible reaching the shoreline , including setting fires to burn-off the oil ; soaking up the oil ; and placing protective barriers around shorelines . The precise scale of the unfolding disaster remains uncertain owing to the lack of clarity over how long the leak will last . In the worst-case scenario , as U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has suggested , the leak could continue for several more months . Uncertainty is also increased by the fact that BP executives are reported to have admitted to members of the U.S. Congress that the amount of oil spilling could intensify -- perhaps by several multiples of the current leakage per day -- if they can not cap the flow . Hopes for a relatively early end to the leakage are resting largely upon the success of the operation to install a five-storey , 100 tonne containment dome . The device was to be lowered by cranes around 1500 metres to the sea floor and , if possible , positioned over the two areas of leaking pipe . If successful , the dome would serve as a giant funnel , collecting and piping it for collection on the sea surface . However , this operation has only been applied at a much smaller water depth and the first attempt to employ the device here has not been successful . Even if successful , the dome will not stem all of the leakage -LRB- perhaps 80-90 percent of it -RRB- and there remains a risk of explosion when the oil reaches the surface because of the volatile mix of oil , gas and water . Thus , the operation can only be a holding one to buy time until the spillage can be shut off at the two remaining sources of the leak . While shutting off the leakage at source will be an immensely difficult task , hopes will have been raised last week by the fact that BP successfully shut off the smallest of the three original leakages . This was done by placing a valve over the ruptured pipe and shutting it off using a remotely controlled submarine . The best hope of shutting off the two remaining sources of leakage is getting the blow-out preventor working again . This is the system , which should act as an emergency cut-off to stop oil continually spilling out if a pipe is damaged , and which failed catastrophically last month . However , the blow-out preventor is proving immensely hard to fix , in large part because of the exceptional depth of the water . Hopes rest largely upon robot submarines re-starting the system . In the event that the blow-out preventor can not be fixed , relief wells have begun to be drilled that could be used to siphon off the oil leaking from the holed pipeline . This operation will take an estimated two to three months as the drilling is taking place at 1500 metres water depth and a further 5 kilometres into the hard rock . The relief well can also be drilled such that the shaft of the new well enters into the shaft of the existing , problematic well . A cement prop can then be inserted to stop the flow in the first well . This requires extremely accurate drilling , but that technique has been proven before . Inevitably , all of this environmental mitigation and emergency replacement activity is proving extremely expensive . The cost of operations to BP alone is an estimated 6 million dollars a day , and independent estimates have put the final bill at between 3 billion and 12 billion dollars . However , the effects of this accident can not be expressed in money terms alone , because of the growing scale of the environmental disaster if the oil spill can not be contained soon . Once the crisis is over , industry and government will need to make an urgent in-depth analysis of the cause of the accident to ensure that similar incidents can never happen again . The Canadian oil sands can finally officially pass the crown Dirty oil off to their rightful owners the offshore producers and shippers . Oil sands can provide clean and environmentally friendly oil to the world for over a hundred years . This without bringing the hurt and pain to environmentally sensitive regions that do not deserve this again . It s unfortunate that this needed to happen for the world to wake up that an endless supply is located onshore . I submitted an idea to BP a few days ago which I believe will work , to stop the leak . They already have a 78 ton metal box which they can put on top of the leak on the ocean floor . I suggest they start vacuuming mud off the sea bed and dumping the mud on top of the box . Eventually , the mud will build up a large roughly conical mound on top of , and around , the box and leak . The weight of the mud bearing down on the box will seal it effectively against the sea bed . The sheer mass of mud will counteract the overpressure of the oil from the well . The relief well currently being drilled will eventually remove the oil overpressure , so the mud can then be removed by pumps and the leak sealed in a more permanent fashion . Everyone is worried about the oil coming up uncontrolled from the sea bed . The biggest worrier I have seen so far is BP . Sure they are losing millions because of this oil floating up and kill fish and wildlife daily . They are also spending millions , without comment about how much money they are spending or for that matter losing on this one site . I 'll bet you that 99.9 % of the population worried about this pollution are still buying fuel for their cars . Of those I 'd guess that about 50 % of these go to any other company that is not BP . Yes I can see everyone being mad and worried about this problem happening , I would just see that the support of BP while it is happening a good idea . Sure if you wish , go to another oil company when the problem is fixed . Unfortunately , I am the occupant of an electric wheel chair 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . If I was still able to drive a vechile on the roads , until this problem is solved , I would gladly by my fuel from BP to make a donation so they can clean up ASAP . If its not a blow by or fear for a blow by , its rather simple to replace the so called failing BOP . 20 years ago I presented my company a concept of an equipment to replace a failing BOP . Any way , 27 years ago I presented the oil majors Shell , Exxon and BP a concept for oil drilling ; cheaper , faster and safer . Most major advances in oil drilling of the last 25 years were included in that concept ; coiled , monodiameter , underbalanced , snake . So to my opinion the oil spill is a result of rather clumsy operations . best regards , www222Lu , JvdVeen Kees Willemse is professor of offshore engineering at Delft University .

Davis\\/U . S. Navy photo\\/Handout By Caren Bohan and Steve Gorman WASHINGTON\\/PORT FOURCHON , Louisiana | Fri May 14 , 2010 5:45 pm EDT WASHINGTON\\/PORT FOURCHON , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday slammed the companies involved in a massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill as BP Plc readied a siphoning system to contain a growing environmental disaster . Obama applied further pressure on the companies involved in the unfolding drama , criticizing them for a `` ridiculous spectacle '' of publicly trading blame over the accident in his sternest comments yet on the situation . With oil gushing unchecked from a blown-out well a mile under the Gulf of Mexico , London-based BP began work on its latest short-term fix -- a tube that undersea robots will try to insert into a pipe to funnel oil to the surface . The device could begin siphoning oil late Friday , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said . The energy giant 's prior attempt to contain the oil -- a giant containment dome -- failed last week after the appearance of frozen hydrocarbons rendered it useless . The so-called riser insertion tool is `` the best option , the most likely option to combat '' the frozen hydrocarbons , Suttles said . If short-term efforts fail , it will take BP about 90 days to permanently cap the leak with a relief well . Shares of companies involved in the disaster , including BP , have taken a big hit in recent days , but now other firms that make a living in the Gulf of Mexico 's oil-rich waters are starting to feel financial pain . The U.S. Department of the Interior issued a moratorium on new drilling permits at least until May 28 when a safety review is due to be completed . But now , analysts and investors are beginning to fret future implications of the ban . In comments after a meeting with his Cabinet to discuss efforts to stop the spill and minimize its impact on U.S. Gulf Coast communities , Obama said he was angry and frustrated about the spill , which threatens an ecological and economic disaster in the Gulf region . `` I have to say , though , I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter . You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else , '' Obama said . Obama was referring to testimony this week in Congress by leaders of the three companies involved in the disaster -- BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd. . None of the three took responsibility for the spill , and instead blamed one another . Fisheries and tourism , two of the Gulf Coast 's economic mainstays , along with birds , sea turtles and other wildlife , are threatened by the spreading slick . The accident also could cripple attempts in Washington to overhaul U.S. energy policy . Obama repeated a demand that BP must pay for the spill 's cleanup and other economic impact on the Gulf region but said the U.S. government would use `` every available resource '' to stop oil from coming ashore . He said he would not `` rest or be satisfied '' until the leak was stopped at its source . `` We absolutely understand and share President Obama 's sense of urgency over the length of time this complex task is taking , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said in a statement . The spill began after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers . It threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska to become the worst ecological disaster in U.S. history . The tone of Obama 's Rose Garden comments were his sternest yet on the catastrophe . In the aftermath of the spill , the Obama administration was faulted by some for the speed of its response , with some drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . The White House rejects the criticism , and Obama 's visit to Louisiana on May 2 to meet with local officials and residents helped to dampen it . But as the leak begins to move ashore , the administration wants to head off any potential political fallout , especially with congressional elections looming in November . Obama also said he directed U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to undertake a `` top-to-bottom '' review of the Minerals Management Service , the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling . On Tuesday , Salazar announced that the agency will be split in order to separate the collection of oil royalties from safety inspection duties . `` For too long , for a decade or more , there 's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill , '' Obama said . A six-month halt in new drilling would defer as much as 80,000 barrels -LRB- 3.4 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil equivalent per day , or 4 percent of projected production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2011 , according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie . `` Longer term , after the moratorium is eventually lifted the cost implications of this accident on future drilling could prove significantly detrimental for the industry , '' research firm Raymond James said in a note to clients on Friday . A U.S. lawmaker on Friday urged BP to provide more information about how much oil is gushing from its ruptured well , noting that estimates range from 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- per day . Democratic Representative Edward Markey said the public deserves to know exactly how much oil will end up in the ocean and ultimately on U.S. coastlines . BP , whose shares have tumbled and wiped out $ 30 billion of market value since the April 20 rig fire , has said the oil spill had cost it $ 450 million so far . BP shares dropped more than 3 percent in London on Friday . BP defended its lower spill estimate of 5,000 bpd . `` I think that 's a good range , '' Suttles said on CNN . `` I do n't know the precise number , but I think it 's somewhere around that number .

As BP pushed forward with its tricky undersea effort to redirect the flow of oil after another setback , two members of President Barack Obama 's Cabinet demanded that BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward explain in detail the company 's commitment to pay for damage caused by the enormous spill . `` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a letter to Hayward . `` Therefore , in the event that our understanding is inaccurate , we request immediate public clarification of BP 's true intentions , '' they added . With crude oil gushing unabated into the sea from its blown-out offshore well a mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- deep on the floor of the Gulf , BP sought to guide undersea robots to insert a small tube into a 21-inch -LRB- 53-cm -RRB- pipe , known as a riser , to funnel the oil to a ship at the surface . BP 's initial attempt to insert the tube into the riser ran into trouble when the metal frame that supports the siphon shifted , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told reporters in Robert , Louisiana on Saturday . Suttles said BP hopes to get the siphoning tube inserted late on Saturday night and operational overnight . `` We did have to pull it back to surface -LRB- Friday -RRB- to make some adjustments so that we could connect it properly to the pipework , '' Suttles said . `` We expect to begin operation of that equipment overnight tonight . '' The company 's previous attempt to contain the oil using a giant containment dome failed last week . The spill began after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers . It threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska as the worst U.S. ecological disaster ever . Fisheries and tourism , two of the Gulf Coast 's economic mainstays , along with birds , sea turtles and other wildlife , are threatened by the spreading slick . In an interview published in a British newspaper on Friday , Hayward appeared to play down the disaster . `` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . The amount of volume of oil and dispersant that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total volume of water , '' Hayward was quoted as saying in Britain 's Guardian newspaper . Hayward also acknowledged his job was on the line and that he would be judged by the company 's response to the disaster . BP 's shares have tumbled and wiped out $ 30 billion of market value since the disaster began last month . Questions have been raised about current U.S. law that limits to $ 75 million energy companies ' liability for lost business and local tax revenues from oil spills . Writing to Hayward , Salazar and Napolitano cited statements by BP executives that the company was taking responsibility for the spill and would cover spill-related costs . `` Based on these statements , we understand that BP will not in any way seek to rely on the potential $ 75 million statutory cap to refuse to provide compensation to any individuals or others harmed by the oil spill , even if more than $ 75 million is required to provide full compensation to all claimants , '' Salazar and Napolitano wrote . Earlier , BP spokesman Mark Proegler said oil washed up in Mississippi for the first time in the state on Saturday , when tar balls were discovered at Long Beach . Oil has now contaminated several beaches in three states after it was also located at sites in Louisiana and Alabama . Officials said that so far the spill has had minimal impact on the shoreline and wildlife but a massive operation is underway to protect areas seen as vulnerable along the coast . Seeking to curb the volume of oil reaching the surface , the U.S. Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency have authorized more undersea use of chemical dispersants at the source of the leak . Dispersants are designed to break the oil into small droplets more likely to sink to the sea floor . Suttles , speaking to reporters after flying over the scene of the spill , said the use of the chemical dispersants appears to be working . `` The oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations , '' Suttles said . Some environmental groups and the Gulf 's shrimping industry have raised concerns about the effect of the chemicals , saying the oil might not sink all the way , but become suspended in the water column and ingested by fish and other wildlife . Cleanup crews continue attacking the oil slick using surface dispersants , skimming and controlled burns . Inland , BP contractors assisted by flotillas of hired shrimp boats continued to string containment booms around sensitive coastal areas . National Guard teams with bulldozers and helicopters pressed on to plug gaps in booms protecting Louisiana 's storm-battered shoreline to prevent oil from reaching the fragile marshlands behind them . The vast but dwindling marshes are the nurseries for shrimp , oysters , crabs and fish that make Louisiana the leading producer of commercial seafood in the continental United States and a top destination for recreational anglers . Obama on Friday gave a tongue-lashing to all the companies involved in the spill -- BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd -- and said he would not rest until the leak was stopped at its source . Estimates of the rate of escaping oil range widely from the official BP figure of 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 litres -RRB- , adopted by the government , to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million litres -RRB- per day .

But reports of huge oil plumes in the Gulf -- including one as large as 10 miles long , three miles wide and 300 feet thick -- underscored the spill 's environmental impact as the crisis moved into its 24th day . Crude oil has been gushing unchecked from a ruptured well about a mile under the ocean 's surface , threatening an ecological and economic calamity along the U.S. Gulf Coast . After other attempts to contain the spill failed , BP Plc succeeded in inserting a tube into the leaking well and capturing some oil and gas . The underwater operation used guided robots to insert a small tube into a 21-inch -LRB- 53-cm -RRB- pipe , known as a riser , to funnel the oil to a ship at the surface . `` It 's working as planned and we are very slowly increasing the rate that is coming from the riser tool up to the surface , '' BP senior executive vice president Kent Wells told reporters at BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston . `` So we do have oil and gas coming to the ship now . '' Not all of the oil was being trapped , however . Wells said it was too early to say how much had been siphoned . `` This is a good step forward , '' said Satish Nagarajaiah , professor in civil and mechanical engineering at Rice University in Houston , but he said the siphon tool is unlikely to capture more than 15-20 percent of the oil . The Obama administration downplayed the significance of BP 's latest breakthrough . `` This technique is not a solution to the problem , and it is not yet clear how successful it may be , '' Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said in a joint statement . Preparations for a maneuver to inject mud into the well to stop the leak for good were ongoing and would be completed in seven to 10 days , Wells said . Undersea robots are preparing pipes and hoses around the well to pump up to 40 barrels -LRB- 1,680 gallons -RRB- per minute of mud into the well . BP 's best near-term hope of stopping oil from pouring from the well is `` kill mud , '' a heavy mixture of synthetic materials that technicians will attempt to shoot into the well to form a barrier to prevent oil and gas from escaping . `` Ultimately it is a winning game that we outpump the well , '' Wells said . If the mud fails to seal the well , BP will attempt to inject golf balls , tire fragments and other materials into the well to clog it up , known in the industry as a `` junk shot . '' The success on Sunday followed a previous setback , when a cord taking the oil to the surface became entangled . BP 's earlier attempts to contain the leaking well have been stymied by the technical difficulties of working in the sea floor 's cold , dark conditions . On May 7 , BP tried to lower a containment dome over the leak , but the 100-tonne device was rendered useless by a slush of frozen hydrocarbons that clogged it . The spill began after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers . It threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska as the worst U.S. ecological disaster . POTENTIAL RISK TO THE EAST , FLORIDA KEYS So far , winds have pushed the giant slick westward and toward shore . But according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the southern edge of the spill could make its way into a powerful ocean current that could carry oil eastward toward the Florida Keys and up the U.S. Eastern Seaboard . `` The southern edge of the plume could begin moving more to the southwest and potentially into the Loop Current , '' NOAA said on its website , referring to the deep ocean stream that transfers heat from the tropics to higher latitudes and becomes the Gulf Stream . Officials have stressed the spill has had minimal impact on the shoreline and wildlife , but oil debris and tar balls were washing up on barrier islands and outlying beaches in at least a dozen places in Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi . `` As nasty as they are , they are more manageable than a slick . They can be collected . They can be cleaned and we have crews doing that , '' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Luke Pinneo , referring to the tar balls found on Grand Isle , Louisiana . Scientists and residents of the Gulf Coast say a greater concern is the anticipated encroachment of oil into the environmentally fragile bayous and marshes teeming with shrimp , oysters , crabs , fish , birds and other wildlife . The New York Times and other media reported scientists had detected huge oil plumes -- large columns of concentrated oil moving beneath the ocean surface -- in the Gulf , indicating the leak could be worse than estimates by BP and the government . Estimates of the rate of escaping oil range widely from the official BP figure of 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- , adopted by the government , to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- per day . BP said it had no confirmation of such undersea oil plumes and its spokesman , Andrew Gowers , appeared to dismiss the reports as scientifically unlikely . `` It is my observation as a layman that oil is lighter than water and tends to go up , '' Gowers told reporters . BP is facing growing political pressure to prove it will pay for all of the costs related to the spill . Salazar and Napolitano demanded in a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward that the company make clear its commitment to `` redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill . '' The letter was released on Saturday and amid concerns about the implications of a U.S. law that limits energy companies ' liability for lost business and local tax revenues from oil spills to $ 75 million . BP spokesman David Nicholas said : `` What they are requesting in the letter is absolutely consistent with all our public statements on the matter . President Barack Obama 's administration wants to raise the liability limit retroactively . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . To all the morons yelling `` drill baby drill '' now is the time for you idiots to all move down to the gulf coast and buy some real estate . Now is the time put your money where your mouth is and demonstrate to the nation what `` patriots '' you really are . Afterall , this is the price we must all pay so we can continue to drive gas guzzling SUVs , right ?

London-based BP Plc said its latest `` quick fix '' -- a mile-long siphon tube deployed by undersea robots down to the leaking well -- was capturing about a fifth of the oil leaking from the ruptured well . Officials cautioned that the tube is helping contain the oil but will not stop the flow . The company 's stock rose more than 2 percent in London on the news but later shed its gains . More efforts to stem the spill were under way and there is another smaller leak besides the one now being targeted . `` I do feel that we have , for the first time , turned the corner in this challenge , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said in Florida after meeting with Governor Charlie Crist . `` Over the last 48 hours , we 're beginning to meet with some significant success , '' Hayward said . BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the company hoped the pipe could help contain half of the oil escaping from the well . `` We 're getting a little over a thousand barrels of oil a day up through that tube and over the course of today we 'll be trying to increase that rate . '' BP executives have faced tough questions from the U.S. government over the huge spill threatening economic and environmental calamity to the U.S. Gulf Coast . The disaster has hurt BP 's image , already tarnished in the United States from a 2006 spill in Alaska from a BP-owned pipeline and 2005 fire at the company 's Texas City refinery that killed 15 workers and injured 180 . A study released by the Center for Public Integrity showed two BP-owned U.S. refineries accounted for 97 percent of all flagrant safety violations found in the refining industry by government inspectors over the past three years . `` The only thing you can conclude is that BP has a serious , systemic safety problem in their company , '' Jordan Barab , deputy assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health , was quoted as saying in a statement from the nonprofit group . U.S. lawmakers are studying raising a cap on corporate liability for oil spills , but . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has rejected a proposed cap of $ 10 billion for oil companies to cover damages from oil spills as `` inadequate . '' The spill threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident off Alaska as the worst U.S. ecological disaster . While the U.S. Gulf Coast has so far been spared a massive landfall of heavy oil , small amounts in the form of surface sheen and tar balls , have come ashore in outlying parts of the coastline of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama . `` People are freaking out . They see the news and think oil is everywhere , but it is not , '' said Michael Dorie , co-owner of Wild Native and Five Rivers Delta Safaris , which takes people on eco-tours of Alabama 's Mobile Tensaw Delta . `` If it all dries up and disappears , well the highlight of my tours is wildlife and pretty flowers . Take that away and my tour becomes just a boat ride . If people see oil slicked birds , how many more will not come ? '' Shrimpers in southeastern Louisiana remained bleak despite news of BP 's progress . `` They 're a big company . They 'll probably change their name and start over , '' said Drake Dupre , 48 , a shrimp boat captain . `` We 've got one life . We ca n't start over again . We 're not rich . '' Detailing the undersea efforts , BP 's Suttles said a suction tube had been inserted into a well riser pipe that fell to the ocean floor after last month 's explosion and sinking of a rig drilling the BP-owned well . The riser pipe has been gushing oil from the blown-out well . The inserted suction tube was siphoning off 1,000 barrels per day , about one fifth of the 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- BP estimated to be leaking per day . Other estimates are much higher . BP said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it would take time to try to increase the amount of oil and gas being siphoned off to a surface ship . `` This remains a new technology and both its continued operation and its effectiveness in capturing the oil and gas remains uncertain . Other containment options continue to be progressed , '' it added . BP 's next move , which it hopes will stop the flow completely , would involve a so-called `` top kill '' option in which engineers using the undersea robots would try to shoot heavy `` mud , '' a mixture of synthetic materials , into the well to form a barrier to prevent oil and gas from escaping . This may be combined with a `` junk shot '' to inject material like golf balls and pieces of rubber tire , into the ruptured well 's failed `` blowout preventer '' to seal off oil flow . `` LOOP CURRENT '' COULD CARRY OIL Investors have already knocked around $ 30 billion off BP 's value over the spill , which followed the April 20 explosion in which eleven workers were killed . Survivors ' accounts to media raised questions about whether safety controls were observed . In comments to U.S. media over the weekend , scientists said they had found huge underwater `` plumes of oil '' several miles long in the Gulf of Mexico , suggesting much wider impact on the marine habitat than previously thought . But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cast doubt on those reports , saying no definitive conclusions had been reached about the discovery of `` undersea layers . '' `` The hypothesis that the layers consist of oil remains to be verified , '' it said . There are fears that as the oil slick , which is broken into segments , spreads through the action of winds and current , it could run into the so-called `` Loop Current '' that could take it down to the Florida Keys and even up the U.S. East Coast . NOAA said that with light winds forecast from the south and the west in coming days , `` ocean models indicate that any tar balls leading the southern edge of the plume could begin moving more to the south west and potentially into the Loop Current . '' `` The worst case would be if a hurricane comes through , that is my biggest fear , '' Alabama boat captain Dorie said . But U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry told reporters the oil had not entered the `` Loop Current '' yet . The U.S. Senate 's Homeland Security Committee began a hearing on the oil spill on Monday . BP had been under intense scrutiny by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration since the refinery explosion in 2005 , according to the Center for Public Integrity study . Refinery inspection data obtained by the center for OSHA 's nationwide program and the parallel Texas City inspection show BP received 862 citations between 2007 and 2010 for alleged violations at its refineries in Texas City and Toledo , Ohio . Virtually all were for alleged violations of OSHA 's process safety management standard , rules governing everything from storage of flammable liquids to emergency shutdown systems . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It 's good to see some progress on the leak ; however , these massive plumes of oil floating in deep water in the Gulf , according to scientists and your report , are n't going away and they are very likely to resurface at some point . It seems like there 's an `` out of sight , out of mind '' attitude about the biggest part of this spill ... It would be helpful to know what BP plans to do to siphon up that spilled oil from the deep before it can cause unrecoverable ecological damage . I 'm talking about the reported 10 mile long , 3 mile wide types of oil plumes floating in 3,300 feet of water -LRB- and apparently more of them than this big one -RRB- . What 's planned or being done to locate and pump that stuff out of the Gulf of Mexico ? If BP wo n't do it , who will ? From what I 've read , this particular huge oil plume is around 100 miles from the Gulf 's `` loop current '' , which could pull that plume out of the Gulf toward Florida , the Caribbean and perhaps even the Atlantic ocean . I am concerned that nobody seems concerned about recovering this deep oil , which is apparently the bulk of the spill , and instead seem to be `` writing it off '' . It 's surprising there 's no discussion about what 's going to be done about it and when . Once that oil hits that loop current , it may be too late , so time 's a wastin ... This story seems to clarify why BP is n't discussing a plan to recover the oil plumes that scientists have discovered in the deep -- they do n't want to admit these plumes exist ! Do they believe `` microbes '' are going to do this part of the cleanup ? It 's time to stop just trying to pretend the plume dosnt exist . It really scares me that it will soon hit the gulf stream and dispurse all over thge world eventually . Of course it exists it explaines where the oil is going . It has been pouring oil out nonstop since April 20 . And it explains how the massive discrepancy in the volume of the oil leak and spill size is going unnoticed for now , while the sea shore impacts thus far have been less than expected .

Investors have knocked around $ 30 billion off BP 's value since an explosion at a drilling rig killed 11 people and began an oil spill the London-based major is struggling to plug nearly a month after the accident happened . The U.S. media and political machine has turned its full force on BP and U.S. President Barack Obama has set up a commission into the leak which is sending an estimated 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- into Gulf of Mexico waters . In contrast , the international media has largely ignored the latest incidents of pipeline damage in Nigeria , where the public can only guess how much oil might have been leaked . The most recent damage in Nigeria , which has not been attributed to militant attacks that have preyed on Nigerian oil infrastructure for years , forced U.S. operator ExxonMobil to relieve itself of contractual obligations by declaring force majeure on its exports of Nigerian benchmark crude . The light sweet crude is particularly well-suited for refining into gasoline and is regularly supplied to the United States , the world 's biggest oil burner . Exxon declined the opportunity to give details of the damage , clean-up or repair work . An industry source , who declined to be named , said 100,000 bpd of oil had leaked for a week from a pipeline that has since been mended . `` If this -LRB- the BP spill -RRB- were in the Niger Delta , no one would be batting an eyelid , '' said Holly Pattenden , African oil analyst at consultants Business Monitor International . `` They have these kind of oil spills in Nigeria all the time . '' BP 's share price has fallen around 18 percent since news of the fire at the drilling station on April 20 , while Exxon shares were largely unchanged after the force majeure announcement . The largest operator in Nigeria , Royal Dutch Shell has clashed with the Nigerian government for decades following numerous spills in Africa 's largest energy producer . Shell said in a statement on its website that its Nigerian joint venture cleans up oil spills as quickly as possible , no matter what their cause , but is sometimes delayed by security concerns or because some communities deny access . The Anglo-Dutch major said the volume of oil spills in Nigeria for its joint venture was almost 14,000 tonnes last year , the equivalent of around 280 bpd , mainly because of militant attacks on facilities . `` It -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- is without doubt the worse place for BP to lose their political capital , '' said James Marriott , oil and gas analyst at environmental organization Platform . `` If the U.S. administration gets aggressive against BP , then it 's a problem for them offshore , onshore in terms of shale gas , for conventional gas , refining , some cross-border projects with Canada and further afield . '' In the United States , BP 's massive spill and the risk of an environmental catastrophe could have implications throughout the industry as it has reopened the debate about deepwater drilling . Analysts say , however , the world is hugely dependent on deepwater drilling to secure oil supplies . The ExxonMobil force majeure relates to shallow offshore oil , but much of West Africa 's crude production , like that in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , is deepwater . Analysts say it is unrealistic to veto deepwater drilling if the world 's oil needs are to be met . `` Perhaps in terms of health and safety regulation -LRB- things will change -RRB- , but not in terms of drilling , '' said Angus McPhail of Wood Mackenzie consultants . `` It is not really feasible to stop drilling altogether as long as there is good demand for the product ... It would be total economic madness .

Congressional pressure on federal agencies , especially the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , is likely to lead to tighter rules for the oil and natural gas sector . The Senate Homeland Security committee kicked off a series of hearings examining the government 's role in the cleanup of the massive oil leak threatening the U.S. Gulf Coast on Monday with testimony from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson are scheduled to answer lawmakers ' questions regarding the rig disaster on Tuesday . Executives from BP Plc and Transocean Ltd will also face more congressional grilling this week . BP is already facing legislation that would make the company pay more for the economic damages resulting from the rig accident . Meanwhile , the White House last week offered its own legislative plan to pay for the spill . Following is a look at some of the new laws and regulations that may result from the spill . Facing attacks for not doing enough to prevent the rig disaster , the Interior Department last week announced it would change the way it oversees offshore drilling . In addition to separating the Minerals Management Service 's oil royalty collection and safety inspection roles , the department is reviewing environmental permitting procedures for offshore oil production . As part of the shift , the Obama administration has asked for an additional $ 29 million to pay for more inspections of offshore platforms and a review of procedures . The overhaul is expected to lead to stricter regulations of offshore drilling . With the agency coming under heavy fire for allowing BP to bypass some environmental studies , there will likely be more stringent environmental analysis and oil spill response plans . Regulators will also likely establish more rules regarding the equipment and techniques used in offshore oil production . The current focus on faulty blowout preventers and well cementing procedures as a possible causes for the accident will likely lead to more standards in those areas . Interior has placed a moratorium on any new offshore drilling permits until at least May 28 when a safety review is due to be completed . Any significant extension of this moratorium could have a major impact on offshore drilling companies and lower projected Gulf oil production . Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs chairman Joseph Lieberman said on Monday that until questions surrounding the preparation and response efforts for this deepwater oil spill are answered , the government should not allow any new deepwater wells to be permitted and drilled . Some lawmakers from coastal states have also called for a complete halt to offshore drilling in any new areas , saying the risk is just too great for coastal economies . Still other lawmakers are still looking to expand offshore drilling , but with additional protections in place . The Senate climate bill released last week would allow U.S. states to prohibit offshore oil activity within 75 miles of their coasts . Lawmakers in both chambers have proposed bills that would raise the amount of money BP would be required to dole out for economic losses caused by the spill to $ 10 billion from the current cap of $ 75 million . U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday said a $ 10 billion liability limit would be `` inadequate , '' however . While it is unclear exactly how much the cap will be lifted , it is almost certain that BP and other oil companies drilling offshore will be responsible for covering much more than $ 75 million in economic losses in the future . There are also likely to be changes to the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , authorized for use in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez disaster . Lawmakers are considering raising the 8 cent per barrel fee the industry pays to support the fund by 1 to 25 cents . The White House proposal released last week would increase this per barrel fee by 1 cent . Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has introduced legislation that would impose an annual fee of $ 10 for every acre leased for offshore drilling to raise money for clean energy transportation technology . Lautenberg said the fee could raise $ 1.8 billion a year . The additional fees and liability risks could hurt smaller oil and natural gas operators offshore that may not be able to handle the costs . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . On April 28.2010 Ken Salazar announced his decision at a joint Massachusetts State House news conference with Gov. Deval Patrick voting to go forward with the Nantucket , Massachusetts wind turbine project . The same day of this decision more than 5000 barrels of oil had poured into the Gulf of Mexico . -LRB- one barrel equals 42 gallons -RRB- . We have to ask who was in charge of MMS while Ken was in Boston ? Do we trust our government ? The federal government aka the Mineral Management Service gave the Cape Wind permit while the Gulf of Mexico was being destroyed . The MMS permits should all be reviewed including the ocean wind permit ! MMS spent more time on the Cape Wind permit while they could have been doing their job in the Gulf What they should be focusing on is how to stop the leak ... there will be plenty of time to point fingers and fix the system later . I do n't understand why this has n't been resolved , if I had the particulars -LRB- design drawings -RRB- and pictures of the piping I could already have designed a solution -LRB- or two -RRB- ... the fact that the leaks continue is mind boggling ! Well you do n't have to me a expert to know that the oil will soon get into the Gulf Stream and at 5 miles per hour . A little onshore winds and the whole east coast of Fla first then the USA will have tar balls floating up on its beaches . And BP that says it will pay for all bills related should have 10,000 workers daily till every freken ball is picked up . Larger problem they probably have 20 more wells with same defective blowout valves ... . . This discussion is now closed .

However , a live video feed of the leak , provided by BP , showed a black plume of crude oil still billowing out into the deep waters . `` It 's just not working , '' U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer , who heads the Environment and Public Works Committee , told CNN as she watched the BP video . The California Democrat denounced a `` cover-up '' of the real size of the oil spill . The increased amount of oil BP reports being captured tallied with an estimate -- originally given by government and BP officials overseeing the spill response -- for the total crude leaking from the Macondo well that blew out on April 20 . The resulting rig explosion killed 11 workers . Proegler and other BP spokesmen made clear the increased containment , while an advance , was not siphoning all the escaping oil . `` We 're not claiming that we stopped it -- although that is our final objective . We 're saying that this is what we 're capturing now , '' he said . The U.S. government , grappling with a potentially huge environmental and economic disaster , said on Thursday it would not rely only on data given by well owner BP , but would make its own checks on the total size of the leak . Boxer and Florida Democrat Senator Bill Nelson cited estimates by scientists who believe the real size of the leak is much higher -- as much as 70,000 barrels -LRB- 2.9 million gallons\\/11 million litres -RRB- , per day or even more . `` The truth needs to be told ... At some point we need to stop all this cover-up , '' Boxer said . With heavy oil sloshing ashore in Louisiana 's fragile marshlands , heralding an ecological catastrophe , President Barack Obama 's administration faces criticism that it has been too willing to accept BP 's estimates of the gushing oil . Popular anger against BP has risen , especially among Gulf Coast residents -- shrimpers , fishermen and tourism operators -- who fear their livelihoods will be devastated by the spill . BP 's shares , after initially falling in London trading , closed just over 5 percent up . BP CEO Tony Hayward has been quoted recently by British media as playing down the size of the spill and its environmental impact . `` We 're not depending on what BP is telling us , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told CNN . Steve Wereley , associate mechanical engineering professor at Purdue University , said most independent estimates of the spill flow were `` considerably higher than BP 's . '' `` This is not rocket science , '' Wereley told a U.S. congressional panel on Wednesday . BP spokesmen said the original 5,000 bpd estimate was given by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Salazar said BP was responsible for damages so getting accurate data was essential . `` It 's a grave and a very serious situation and we 're taking nothing for granted , '' Salazar told NBC 's `` Today '' show . Wildlife and environmental groups have accused BP of holding back information on the real size and impact of the growing slick and on the quantity and toxicity of dispersants being used against the oil , both above and below the water . A BP spokesman said the company had received a letter from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asking it to switch to other dispersants . `` We are looking at what we can to do to comply , '' he said . The spokesman was responding to a Washington Post report that said the EPA informed BP officials late on Wednesday that the company had 24 hours to choose a less toxic form of chemical dispersants to break up the oil spill . The report , citing government sources , said U.S. officials worried about the environmental impact of the dispersants . Sheets of heavy oil came ashore in Louisiana 's wetlands on Wednesday for the first time since the rig exploded a month ago . The marshes are nurseries for shrimp , oysters , crabs and fish that make Louisiana the top commercial seafood producer in the continental United States . Fishing is banned in a large part of the Gulf waters because of the spill . In Pass-a-Loutre , La. , thick sheets of gooey brown oil swamped islands of marsh grass at the southern tip of a Mississippi River channel on Thursday . `` To see the extent to which it is oiled and and the depth into the island is stunning , '' said Maura Wood of the National Wildlife Federation 's Coastal Louisiana Restoration Project . The oil pollution covers only a fragment of the vast network of waterways , channels and islands that make up the Delta region , but environmentalists fear it is just the start . `` It 's going to take a long time for us to recover from BP 's mess , '' boat captain Richard Blink said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . BP has sucked many in our Federal Government in as co-stewards in this mess . Now the smirks from many of the Jerks in BP have got folks in the USA fuming . And the trickle down effect has finally got those in DC wondering what could be next ? Maybe the loss of their jobs ?????? Look at this plan pass it around to those in Oil and Gas for real then get some buy in and make BP stop the oil and gas before it is too late . To all concerned about our future : The following has been sent along to BP without a response . Yet today BP is stating they will try to do a similar thing but not in an oil field way of doing . That does not surprise me they have been doing things left handed and sideways since all this began . I suggest for All that can -- pass this along to BP stressing on them to do the right thing this time To stop the oil and gas from flowing into our Gulf of Mexico . What is at stake ? Bret Hume FOX NEWS spin master said he could see No Oil . Got to watch the mainstream media propaganda spin masters they get their orders from the top of the heap . If you think that way may you set back and think about who we are up against The biggest buck folks in the human history , the Rockefellers and Rothschild s -- then think along those lines asking Are we really sovereign people ? The operators of Reuters must pass this along to the Rothschild s who own Reuters as soon as possible . The games that some are playing at BP will in the end cause a ruckus too hard to mend . I proposed this plan a week ago the oil and gas could have been stopped by now . Yet the mum boo jumbo way this crisis is being handled in the USA is a fault of guilt s that will go back and keep going back until trials are held and many responsible for the lacks found in their actions will put them in jails . Many have not a clue yet I do . To whom it must concern at BP Should I have enough facts about the conditions where you are working , consider this : get a design You have all the dimensions then get an overshot made to fit the top flange looking up where the riser was affixed . Get 5,000 feet of heavy weight 7 or better casing loaded on board for the overshot to be attached . The casing string should be arranged as this : 1 . On the bottom the overshot 2 . Next up 3 or more high pressure check valves to resist the flow of gas and fluids up to the rig installing . Next install 1 or more high-pressure pump out plugs to begin unloading the loss circulation material and heavy weight mud whatever that might be . When installing the casing fill the casing as needed with loss circulation material and heavy weight mud as best designed . Design a cut off charge to be used to separate the drill string from the riser with intent to have it fall away out of the overshot to be installed . Use the roves to set the charge off at the best time after installation of overshot is underway . Should it not fall away as expected then a grapple can be used to pull out of the way . After setting the overshot around the top flange the rubber goods installed will compress . Install cementing plugs as needed and begin pumping as needed . I believe the entire amounts of fluids and solids will go quickly into all exit points at this time . The cement should be pumped down to the setting ring . Should it not go down then close in -- - let set until cement has had time to dry . After that time -- - to release the rig a charge could be set at the depth where cement is in the setting casing -- the remainder can be pulled up and hopefully the nightmare will be ended . I have high hopes that the BOP SUB SEA WELL CONTROL SYSTEM IS STILL UP RIGHT . Now , this is a good idea much better than the current plan that is NOT SANE or SOUND AT ALL -- - NOW my thoughts and ideas are worthy of payment , please advise when we can come to terms .

BP shares closed up one percent Thursday but the markets have raked around $ 30 billion from its value in the month since the rig explosion , which killed 11 workers and sparked the disaster-in-the-making .

BP has been estimating the leak was flowing at a rate of 5,000 barrels per day , but scientists and the government have questioned that figure .

The EPA Thursday directed BP to begin using this safer dispersant within 72 hours . If BP can not identify an available alternative dispersant , the company must provide EPA and the Coast Guard with the reasons they believe no other dispersant meets required standards . The use of dispersants , including those manufactured by Nalco Holding Co. , at such high rates and at such deep levels has set off alarm bells with some environmentalists , who worry the chemicals may have a lasting negative impact .

I do not understand how investors can not recognize this . The spill is obviously more then 5000 barrels a day . It is not just one scientist speaking out , but plenty . BP and the Coast Guard barred reporters from the coast to take pictures . This spill is definitally more then the 1989 Exxon Mobil , and it has definitally surpassed the Q1 profits .

HOUSTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana | Fri May 21 , 2010 5:42 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Anger , skepticism and accusations of lying washed over energy giant BP Plc on Friday as it desperately pursued efforts to contain a month-old seabed well leak billowing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico . U.S. lawmakers and scientists have accused BP of trying to conceal what many believe is already the worst U.S. oil spill , eclipsing the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska . It represents a potentially environmental and economic catastrophe for the U.S. Gulf coast . The London-based energy giant , facing growing federal government and public frustration and allegations of a coverup , said its engineers were working with U.S. government scientists to determine the real size of the leak , even as they fought to control the still-gushing spill with uncertain solutions . President Barack Obama 's administration was keeping up the pressure on BP to do everything possible to stop the leak . `` We are facing a disaster , the magnitude of which we likely have never seen before , in terms of a blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , '' White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters . `` And we 're doing everything humanly possible and technologically possible to deal with that . '' BP 's next planned step is a `` top kill '' -- pumping heavy fluids and then cement into the gushing well to plug it . That operation could start next week , perhaps on Tuesday , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said . Adding to the confusion , BP revised downward on Friday an estimate from Thursday that one of its containment solutions -- a 1 mile-long siphon tube inserted into the larger of two seabed leaks -- was capturing 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil per day . A BP spokesman said the amount of crude oil it sucked from the leak fell to 2,200 barrels -LRB- 92,400 gallons\\/350 ,000 liters -RRB- a day in the 24-hour period ended at midnight on Thursday . `` The rate fluctuates quite widely on this tool , '' Suttles told reporters at a briefing in Robert , Louisiana . Many scientists dismiss an original 5,000 bpd estimate of the total leaking oil -- often defended by BP executives -- as ridiculously low and say it could be as high as 70,000 barrels -LRB- 2.9 million gallons\\/11 million liters -RRB- per day or more . `` There 's a huge amount of uncertainty around that number and it could have a fairly wide range , '' Suttles said . A federal panel will release its estimate of the actual flow rate as early as next week , a Coast Guard official said . `` It 's very clear that BP has not been telling the truth , '' Massachusetts Democratic Representative Ed Markey told CNN . BP denied any coverup and said some third-party estimates of the leak were inaccurate . The company 's shares fell more than 4 percent in London . Michael Gordon , chief executive of Gordon Strategic Communications , a corporate and crisis public relations firm in New York , called BP 's handling of the spill `` a case study in failed crisis communications . '' `` It would not have been possible for them to handle this worse . They are not taking sufficient responsibility for what happened . They 've played a game of ` hot potato ' with the other companies involved , '' he said , referring to BP 's public trading of blame with its partners in the drilling of the well . A month after the well blowout and rig explosion that unleashed the catastrophic spill , sheets of rust-colored heavy oil are starting to clog fragile marshlands on the fringes of the Mississippi Delta , damaging fishing grounds and wildlife . Scientists fear parts of the huge fragmented surface slick will be sucked to the Florida Keys and Cuba by ocean currents . At a briefing in Mobile , Alabama , Coast Guard Incident Commander Captain Steven Poulin said an overflight on Thursday of the oil slick showed that while `` minor portions of sheen '' were in the Loop Current there was `` really no trail or elephant trunk '' of oil extending down into the moving current flow . Markey said it was clear BP was only siphoning off `` just a small fraction . '' `` BP has mismanaged this entire incident from day one , '' he said . `` They should not be trusted . '' BP spokesmen say the original leak estimate came from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , one of its federal partners in the joint spill response . `` I understand the frustration , '' Suttles told CBS . `` We 're supplying information . '' `` It 's obvious they are trying to limit information to protect their economic liability , '' said Markey , chair of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming . In a sign of the Obama administration 's mounting anger and frustration , senior U.S. official have demanded BP share more data on the spill with them , accusing the company of falling short in keeping the government and public informed . There were signs of growing tension between BP officials and the U.S. government at the briefing in Robert . As Suttles described the `` massive amount of information being gathered through this exercise , '' Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry interrupted . `` I have to challenge the word ` exercise , ' Doug , '' Landry said . `` This is a full response . '' BP said it was working with a newly created Flow Rate Technical Team to determine the exact amount of oil escaping . Suttles said BP had spent almost $ 700 million on the spill response and had `` thrown absolutely everything '' at the job . BP also is drilling a relief well to try to plug the leak but it probably would not be finished until August . On the Louisiana coast , fishermen counted the cost to their livelihoods . `` This is going to keep killing stuff and it will make whole areas incapable of supporting marine life , '' said George Barisich , president of the United Commercial Fishermen 's Association .

WASHINGTON | Fri May 21 , 2010 9:03 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama has prevented the BP oil spill from becoming his own Katrina-like nightmare so far , but the political and policy consequences of the disaster are likely to increase as the oil spreads . By repeatedly assigning blame to energy giant BP Plc and focusing ire on the government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling , Obama has deflected criticism that his administration was sluggish in its initial response to the Gulf of Mexico spill . That may not last . A month since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , killing 11 people and leaving a ruptured well that has been leaking crude ever since , the feared environmental catastrophe is becoming more and more real . Heavy oil is hitting Louisiana 's wetlands . Oil-stained animals are being rescued and cleaned . Gulf Coast economies are suffering and preparing for drawn-out damage . Analysts say as the ecological crisis gains traction , voters will punish the president regardless of who is responsible -- an important consideration for Obama ahead of congressional elections in November . `` There is a strong tendency for the public to penalize incumbents even for natural disasters if there is a plausible governmental angle -- regardless of whether the government failed to respond adequately , '' said Eric Schickler , a political science professor at the University of California , Berkley . `` If the oil spill has a significant impact on the Gulf Coast economy -- and as a result , on the U.S. economy as a whole -- it is likely to impose at least some damage on the president and his party . '' Obama 's Democrats , who control both houses of Congress , are expected to lose seats in the election and want to avoid shifting power to Republicans , who would make it more difficult for the president to achieve his policy goals . Obama is aware of the government angle in the crisis and has made his displeasure with the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , the Interior Department agency that regulates offshore drilling , very clear . That agency is now being restructured , but other policy consequences loom , most notably the president 's efforts to pass energy legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase domestic production of renewable fuels and -- tricky under current circumstances -- expand offshore drilling . John Leshy , who served as general counsel for the Interior Department in the Clinton administration , said the spill could hurt Obama 's short-term prospects for an energy overhaul . `` Clearly the spill has dramatized the cost of fossil fuels -- coal , oil and gas , particularly oil . So to that extent it has , I think , boosted the idea that there needs to be energy reform , '' said Leshy , now a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law . `` But in the short term you have to get 60 votes in the Senate , '' he said . `` I think the spill has made that harder . '' An energy bill introduced by Democratic Senator John Kerry and independent Senator Joe Lieberman is languishing in the 100-member legislative body . The offshore drilling provisions were meant to attract Republican support for the bill . Obama 's action plan for advancing that energy law is not clear , but his strategy for dealing with the oil spill has been to act fast . Mindful of the political damage incurred by President George W. Bush 's administration for its response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Obama has not wasted any opportunity to show he is moving quickly and assigning blame . `` Katrina was a natural disaster . This is a man-made disaster , '' said Ken Medlock , an energy fellow at Rice University in Houston , Texas . `` With this particular case , from Day One the Coast Guard has been on the scene . The federal government , as a result , has been involved from Day One . '' Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia , said Obama had learned from Katrina and made clear BP carried the blame for this Gulf disaster . `` Obama has a made-to-order bad guy in BP . And he sure has n't been hesitant about pointing fingers , '' Sabato said . Bad guy or not , public anger about the spill has not helped Obama prevail in getting Congress to raise the cap on oil companies ' liability for big spills . It has also given Republicans , whose support Obama needs to achieve his energy overhaul , potential ammunition against the administration if MMS is found to have been negligent . `` The president has spent a whole lot of time pointing the finger at BP and you should point a finger at BP and the other companies involved , '' Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' show . `` We 're also interested to know what the administration did . Was the Mineral Management Service a part of this administration that approved this site ? It also approved this spill response plan . What kind of oversight did the administration provide during the course of the drilling ? '' Obama plans to create a presidential commission to answer questions such as these and identify the causes of the spill . The amount of time he has will depend on how soon BP plugs the well , how far the oil flows , and how focused the U.S. public remains on the role of companies rather than the role of the government in this environmental crisis .

Obama , in his weekly radio and Internet address , also said offshore oil drilling could only go forward if there were assurances that such accidents would not happen again . While ramping up pressure on companies linked to the still uncapped spill -- BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd -- he said he would also hold Washington accountable for mending its ways . `` First and foremost , what led to this disaster was a breakdown of responsibility on the part of BP and perhaps others , including Transocean and Halliburton , '' Obama said in his toughest remarks yet on companies linked to the spill . `` And we will continue to hold the relevant companies accountable not only for being forthcoming and transparent about the facts surrounding the leak , but for shutting it down , repairing the damage it does , and repaying Americans who 've suffered a financial loss , '' he said . A month after the well blowout and rig explosion that killed 11 workers , sheets of rust-colored heavy oil are clogging fragile marshlands on the fringes of the Mississippi Delta , damaging fishing grounds and wildlife . In his executive order announcing former Democratic Senator Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly would co-chair the commission , Obama made his first reference to the possibility of a criminal probe . `` The commission shall ensure that it does not interfere with or disrupt any ongoing or anticipated civil or criminal investigation or law enforcement activities or any effort to recover response costs or damages arising out of the Deepwater Horizon explosion , fire and oil spill , '' the order stated . The administration is keeping the pressure on BP on many fronts as it strives to show it is being resolute in the face of what many believe is already the worst U.S. oil spill , eclipsing the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expressed frustration on Saturday when it released BP 's response to its directive on dispersants instructing the company to evaluate pre-approved dispersants for toxicity and effectiveness . It accused BP and some of the manufacturers involved of withholding information by invoking business confidentiality . `` EPA continues to strongly urge these companies to voluntarily make this information public so Americans can get a full picture of the potential environmental impact of these alternative dispersants , '' it said . It did not name the companies . In its response released by the EPA , BP said Corexit , a dispersant manufactured by Nalco Holding Co that it has been using , was the only one immediately available in sufficient quantities to tackle the spill and `` remains the best option for subsea application . '' It also said that `` within 28 days of application it does not persist in the environment '' and asked to discuss the situation with the Coast Guard and the EPA before they issue `` directives requiring a change in dispersant products . '' Some environmentalists worry the chemicals in dispersants may have a lasting harmful impact . EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson will return to the Gulf Coast on Sunday to monitor its response while Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar travels to the BP Command Center in Houston to get an update from the federal science team working on the problem . BP made no immediate comment on Obama 's suggestion that it was to blame for the deep-sea disaster . But the company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said he welcomed the establishment of the commission and pledged to work with its co-chairmen . `` We share the goal of the president and the public to know what happened to cause this accident and what regulatory and industry changes are needed to help prevent something like this from happening again , '' Hayward said in a statement . BP on Friday revised downward an earlier estimate that one of its containment solutions , a 1-mile-long siphon tube inserted into the larger of two seabed leaks , was catching 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil per day . BP captured 2,200 barrels in the 24 hours to midnight , according to the incident response team , the same figure it had for the previous 24-hour period . `` To me from the very beginning with BP it was nothing but public relations , '' said Roger Halphen , a south Louisiana school teacher who has worked both in the oil industry and as a commercial fisherman . `` It 's just a disaster . Everybody was sleeping on this and all of a sudden here it is , '' he said of oil fouling the coast . The weather at least was cooperating . `` There 's very little chance of rain and plenty of visibility with low winds and fairly smooth seas , '' said Ken Graham , head of the National Weather Service office in New Orleans . `` For things they need to do out there , they 've got a pretty good window of opportunity . Favorable conditions are expected through the weekend , he said . High winds and rough seas can hinder efforts to burn off or skim oil from the surface . Louisiana authorities are desperate to start building sand levees to keep the spill from swamping their coast , but experts have serious doubts about the $ 350 million project . The company 's next planned step is a `` top kill '' -- pumping heavy fluids and then cement into the gushing well to plug it . Many scientists dismiss an original 5,000 bpd estimate of the total leaking oil -- often defended by BP executives -- as ridiculously low and say it could be 70,000 barrels -LRB- 2.9 million gallons\\/11 million liters -RRB- per day or more .

VENICE , La\\/HOUSTON | Sun May 23 , 2010 7:25 pm EDT VENICE , La\\/HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. government threatened on Sunday to remove BP from efforts to seal a blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico if it does n't do enough to stop the leak , though it acknowledged only the company and the oil industry have the know-how to halt the deepwater spill . The Coast Guard said on Sunday that over 65 miles of Gulf Coast has experienced `` shoreline impact '' and less than half of it could be cleaned up relatively quickly , underscoring the growing ecological toll of the disaster . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Washington is frustrated and angry that BP Plc missed `` deadline after deadline '' in its efforts to seal the well more than a month after an oil rig explosion triggered the disaster . `` I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this oil from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading . We are 33 days into this effort and deadline after deadline has been missed , '' Salazar said after visiting BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston on Sunday . `` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' he told reporters as the administration maintained its hard line . Salazar 's strong comments followed President Barack Obama 's on Saturday , when he blamed the spill on `` a breakdown of responsibility '' at BP . The unfolding disaster has become a top priority on Obama 's crowded domestic agenda . The chief of the Coast Guard , Admiral Thad Allen , acknowledged on Sunday that the government is forced to rely on BP and the private oil sector to try to plug the gusher . At the same time , BP said the containment method it was attempting on the ocean floor was capturing much less of the leaking oil than three days ago . Company engineers were readying other short-term solutions , the next one expected to start late on Tuesday . But BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said there was `` no certainty '' of success at the unprecedented depths at which they were being tried -- one mile down in the Gulf of Mexico . More than a month after a rig explosion triggered what Obama has described as an environmental disaster and `` BP 's mess , '' oil is still spewing virtually unchecked from BP 's ruptured Macondo seabed well . At a time of mounting U.S. government and public criticism of the company and its executives over the catastrophic spill , Allen said he trusted BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who has made comments downplaying its size and environmental impact . Sheets of heavy oil have washed ashore in Louisiana 's fragile marshlands and lesser `` oil debris '' has also reached the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama in what is seen as an ecological and economic calamity for the U.S. Gulf Coast . Given the lack of a solution so far and the doubts over BP , Allen was asked on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' why the U.S. government did not completely take over the spill containment operation from the London-based firm . `` What makes this an unprecedented anomalous event is access to the discharge site is controlled by the technology that was used for the drilling , which is owned by the private sector , '' Allen said . `` They have the eyes and ears that are down there . They are necessarily the modality by which this is going to get solved , '' he added . Asked too about the apparent growing U.S. lack of confidence in Hayward , Allen said : `` I trust Tony Hayward . When I talk to him , I get an answer . '' BP has deployed a long suction tube down to the larger of two leaks from the well , but a BP spokesman said on Sunday this captured only 1,360 barrels per day of oil over the 24 hours to midnight Saturday . The flow has been declining from the 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- per day the company had said the tube was siphoning off three days ago . BP engineers are now preparing a `` top kill , '' pumping heavy fluids into the well to try to shut it off , an operation to begin late Tuesday or early Wednesday , Dudley told CNN . Many scientists believe the Gulf spill has already eclipsed the 11 million gallons -LRB- 41 million liters -RRB- spilled by the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker accident in Alaska . They warn the spreading oil could be caught in a powerful ocean current that could take it to the Florida Keys , Cuba and the U.S. East Coast . Coast Guard Admiral Mary Landry said 65.6 miles of shoreline has been impacted so far and about 30 acres of marshland . She told a briefing that of the area affected on the coast `` 25 miles ... are really readily cleanable and the others are a little harder access but we 'll get to it . '' Of the impacted marshland about half of it has heavily oiled she said the rest `` lightly oiled with sheen . '' Churchgoers in Louisiana coastal parishes affected by the spill prayed for God 's help . `` You -LRB- God -RRB- can clear that oil up , because that oil was down there thousands of years before it came up in the Gulf . So you know what to do with it , dear God , '' retired oyster fisherman Herbert Guidry prayed in the New Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church in Houma . Analysts say growing ecological and economic damage from the spill could become a political liability for Obama before November congressional elections . While also promising to hold Washington accountable for proper oversight of the industry , Obama ramped up pressure on companies linked to the spill : BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd. . He believed a `` breakdown of responsibility '' between them led to the disaster . BP stocks have taken a beating in the markets in the month since the well blowout and rig explosion that killed 11 workers and touched off the spill . Its share price shed another 4 percent on Friday in London , extending recent sharp losses . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

The industry will lobby to avoid this so we the people must be diligent in demanding it without loop holes . Please copy this and post it every where you can Do the math , it s ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY at 70,000 barrels a day x $ 70 a barrel BP will make $ 766,500,000 a year . If BP stops the leak they would not be allowed to complete the two relief wells . Once their grouse negligence is brought out , they would never be allowed to drill that reservoir . So they keep it leaking because that reservoir will pay for the clean up . They are not about to loose $ 10,000,000,000 dollars over the life of the reservoir and pay the clean up cost , unless the Government makes them . BP keeps taking wks between actions but they started drilling two wells right away . Bp should have a second pipe lowered and ready on stand by , they should have tried the hole shot wks ago and the mud fill wks ago . If BP would have stopped the leak wks ago they never get the $ 10,000,000,000 . If BP would come out $ 10,000,000,000 ahead by stopping the leak in 10 days they would have don it , but the clean up cost would have been about the same with no money from the relief wells . IT S ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY . Believe me BP DID THE MATH ! Lets hope that the oil company executives got paid out with sufficiently large bonuses , earned by cutting corners , so as not to be unduly inconvenienced for this science fiction scale catastrophe . Perhaps this will get rid of those pesky fisherman , nature lovers , and tourists , who just get in the way . Seriously , if they did care about anyone else they would have had a plan in place . The fact is , executives are already paid out , and have no stake in what happens next to their large corporations or banks . An act of unspeakable violence has been done . The people have to take back their own country , and lest this become our French revolution moment , what we really need to pray for is PEACEFUL change , because any non peaceful change will sow the seeds of its own illegitimacy , and only replace one problem with another .

Do that and one other thing clean our environment of chemicals and petrochemical products .

I can not understand why BP just ca n't put a hydraulic clamp around the 18 inch pipe along with a prefab rubber seal collar to either cap or attach new pipeline ????? I know there is a lot of pressure gushing upward but one can create a huge hydraulic clamp probably much less in size than the containment cap already tried and proven still not able to contain because there is no way to keep crystals out again a clamp with an open valve could get around that to be robotically shut once clamped on .

In both cases natural gas flowed unnoticed into the well being drilled , causing an explosion . In both cases a critical piece of fail-safe equipment -- the blowout preventer -- failed . And in both cases the operators struggled to quickly staunch the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . BP 's shares have been battered in the month since its Macondo well blew up , threatening tourism , fishing and wildlife along the Gulf Coast and landing the British oil giant with a multibillion dollar clean-up tab . But while Mexico 's Ixtoc well was only 150 feet below the sea surface , Macondo lies at the crushing depth of 5,000 feet , forcing the company to use robots to do all undersea work . But it would still not surpass the extent of the disaster caused by the Ixtoc spill , which belched crude oil for 297 days , dumping nearly 3 million barrels -LRB- 126 million gallons\\/477 million liters -RRB- of oil into the southern Gulf of Mexico , some of which eventually washed up on the Texas coast , according to Pemex . And the experience of Mexico 's state oil company Pemex shows that relief wells are no silver bullet . Ixtoc , off the coast of the southeastern Mexican state of Campeche , continued to leak oil more than three months after Pemex completed its first relief well . Pemex never revealed the exact cause of the accident and as recently as 2007 , Jan Erik Vinnem , an offshore risk management specialist at Norway 's University of Stavanger , wrote that the lessons learned from the disaster were `` unknown . '' Pemex pumped cement and salt water into Ixtoc for months before finally bringing the runaway well under control and sealing it with cement plugs . Pemex 's scramble to come up with other solutions while the relief wells were being drilled will sound familiar to those who have followed BP 's efforts to stop the oil gushing out of its ruptured well . Divers tried to manually operate the blowout preventer but this effort was unsuccessful and over the next several months Pemex tried a variety of solutions , including a plan to force metal spheres into the well to cut the flow of oil and lowering a steel structure over the spill to capture the crude . BP is trying similar schemes but the huge water depth it is operating at is vastly complicating its efforts . The robots used by BP have been unable to get the blowout preventer to work and BP abandoned an attempt to cap its well with a steel structure after natural gas hydrates accumulated within the structure . Executives even mulled shooting golf balls , pieces of tires and other debris into the well to try and stop the flow . The company now plans to attempt a `` top kill '' procedure this week in an effort to stop the flow of oil by forcing heavy drilling fluids into the well , but BP only gives the procedure a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . BP says the spill has already cost it $ 760 million and it has promised to pay all legitimate claims for compensation , which will likely carry the cost to billions of dollars . Pemex spent over $ 100 million on the capping and cleanup operations , but dodged most compensation claims by asserting sovereign immunity against U.S. courts . -LRB- Reporting by Robert Campbell , Editing by Sandra Maler -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . With the way things are going , it appears that relief wells drilled into the bore of the blown out well for the purpose of pumping cement into the well and killing it is the only method that will work . And , that is going to take time because of the water depth where all this is taking place . I 'd like to hear something from the `` drill , baby , drill '' crowd , but they 're as quite as a mouse . Of course , every now and then we do hear something from them like Sen. Murkowsky 's proposal to relieve BP of all liability for this disaster . This disaster may be just what 's needed to wake up the American people as they otherwise do n't care what goes on around them as long as they have their creature comforts to insulate them from a hard world . Maybe , just maybe , they 'll start listening , when people who do know what they 're talking about warn of the grave risks associated with certain activities . The reason the Demoncrats have done NOTHING but allowed the oil spill to spread and spread unabated and BP is using dispersants to cause the oil to spread over the surface of the ocean as much as possible , is because they HOPE that the dark oil on the surface of the water will cause the ocean to absorb MUCH MORE heat from the sun then normal and CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING TO BECOME TRUTH ! As we understand it , Governor Schwarzenegger of California has now turned against offshore oil drilling -LRB- because of the BP wellhead blowout and spill of 2010 -RRB- . That 's a smart political move . One must wonder why President Obama , Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Reid have not also collectively made the same political move ... especially in an election year for the democrat party in congress . By the time Mexico 's Pemex spill of 1979 was brought under control in 1980 , another election year was in progress , i.e. , -LRB- then ex-California -RRB- Governor Reagan v. President Carter . We have been reviewing the Prudhoe Bay Alaska oil spill of just 4 years ago ... attributable to BP 's maintenance policies and procedures . That spill only cost BP a `` trivial '' $ 40 million in fines , etc. , however . We have n't seen B-ritish P-etroleum 's green , environmentally friendly advertising campaign lately , i.e. , `` B-eyond P-etroleum '' . Perhaps BP will rename it `` Beyond the Gulf '' .

The company insisted it was doing all it could to try to seal a blown-out oil well spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil into the Gulf every day , a disaster that threatens to become the worst U.S. oil spill in history . BP said it would make another attempt to plug the five-week-old leak on Wednesday , but gave it only a 60-70 percent chance of success . BP 's shares fell nearly 3 percent in London as investors waited to see whether BP 's latest attempt would work . The company has now lost about 25 percent of its market value -- almost $ 50 billion -- since the spill began . The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Lisa Jackson , said the government would `` absolutely '' levy fines on BP over the spill . `` There are certainly going to be opportunities for fines and penalties , '' she told reporters . With heavy oil already washing into fragile marshlands and wildlife refuges in Louisiana and threatening the livelihoods of Gulf coast residents , the U.S. government is pushing BP to try to contain or seal the leak as soon as possible . But , there appeared to be some signs of disagreement among U.S. officials about just how aggressively the administration should be pressing BP over what President Barack Obama has called an unprecedented environmental catastrophe for the United States . The administration 's response chief for the disaster , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , seemed to take issue with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar 's threat a day earlier to push BP `` out of the way '' if it did not do enough to stop the leak . `` To push BP out of the way would raise the question of ` replace them with what ? ' '' Allen said at a White House news conference . BP was `` exhausting every technical means possible '' to meet its legal responsibility to cap the well and contain the spreading oil , he said . The company was on the defensive on Monday against the harsh criticism from the Obama administration . `` I do n't know of anything else we could do , but if the government felt there were other things to do it is clearly within their power to do that , '' BP Chief Operations Officer Doug Suttles told reporters . The oil spill is a political hot potato for the Obama administration ahead of a November election that is widely expected to erode Democrats ' control of the U.S. Congress . Analysts warn that voters may punish Democrats regardless of who is ultimately deemed responsible for the mess . The latest CNN\\/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that 51 percent of Americans were unhappy with Obama 's handling of the spill that was sparked by an explosion on April 20 . The poll was based on telephone interviews with just over 1,000 people between May 21-23 . The White House has repeatedly said it is the British energy giant 's responsibility to clean up the spill , but with public anger over BP 's handling of the crisis intensifying , there have been calls for the Obama administration to take charge . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , who has been critical of the federal government 's response , again called for more equipment , especially booms , to help stop the oil from making landfall . He said 70 miles of his state 's coastline had been affected by the oil spill . Louisiana 's marshes are nurseries for shrimp , oysters , crabs and fish that make the state the top commercial seafood producer in the continental United States . Fishing is now banned in a large swath of the Gulf because of the spill . During a tour of affected areas of the Gulf coast , Salazar assured residents the government would hold BP accountable for the economic hardship the spill had imposed on them . `` We will keep our boot on their neck until the job gets done , '' Salazar told reporters . `` This is a BP mess , it is a horrible mess and it is a massive environmental mess . '' Salazar said an ongoing investigation by U.S. authorities would hold the company accountable `` both civilly and in whatever way is necessary , '' appearing to leave open the possibility of a criminal inquiry . Asked about the possibility of a criminal investigation , BP CEO Tony Hayward said : `` There will be all sorts of investigations following this . Rightly , and we will deal with them as they come . '' `` TOP KILL '' PLANNED FOR WEDNESDAY A report on the disaster that will influence whether the Interior Department resumes issuing offshore drilling permits will be sent to Obama on Thursday , the White House said . BP said the spill , triggered by an explosion that sank the Deepwater Horizon rig and killed 11 workers , had cost it $ 760 million so far . It also pledged up to $ 500 million on Monday toward studying the impact of the spill . In its latest attempt to plug the leak , BP plans to inject heavy fluids and then cement into the seabed well to block oil flow in a so-called `` top kill '' operation on Wednesday . BP executives have warned there is `` no certainty '' that the containment efforts will be successful , because they have never been attempted at the depths -- a mile down -- where the well is located . The company has estimated that about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have been leaking every day , although some scientists have given much higher numbers for the size of the leak -- up to 70,000 and even 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- per day . Suttles said if the `` top kill '' operation did not work , the company would attempt to put a `` top hat '' containment device over the larger leak to try to capture most of the oil and pipe it up to a tanker on the surface . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . So they keep it leaking to justify drilling relief wells because that reservoir will pay for the clean up . They are not about to loose $ 10,000,000,000 dollars over the life of the reservoir and pay the clean up cost , unless the Government makes them . BP keeps taking wks between actions but they started drilling two wells right away . Bp should have a second pipe lowered and ready on stand by , they should have tried the hole shot wks ago and the mud fill wks ago . If the mud does not work then they will put a new Blow out preventer over the old one -LRB- let me guess they don t have the new one sitting on the bottom next to the well to try 10 minutes after the mud fails -RRB- If BP would come out $ 10,000,000,000 ahead by stopping the leak in 10 days they would have don it , but the clean up cost would have been about the same with no money from the relief wells . IT S ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY . Believe me BP DID THE MATH FAIL CLOSED VALVES must be mandated on Blow Out Preventers for all offshore rigs . In many cases valves are fail close for safety . Fail closed simply means that they are designed so that they need to be activated to remain open , or in the absence of a signal to an activator forcing them open they close . FAIL CLOSED VALVES are mandated in many situations for safety and fire prevention . FAIL CLOSED VALVES must be mandated on Blow Out Preventers for all offshore rigs . The industry will lobby agents FAIL CLOSED VALVES -LRB- there excuses will be lies -RRB- so we the people must be diligent in demanding it , without loop holes . Please copy this and post it every where you can . The government , our President , were absent for far too long in doing anything about the oil spill . The accident , yes it was an accident , was and is a disaster that must not be repeated and one that BP must continue to address . I have seen and heard more concern from BP than I have our President . The government has a big role to play in clean up , control and coordination but all I have really heard from the President is blame and shame . The shame is in the way the President has not stepped up when it comes to protecting our borders in AZ or the water ways of the gulf . He is so busy siding with countries other than our own that he has forgotten , if he ever really knew , that his first job is not the forever campaigning but actually protecting our country . His job is not to plunge us into the mire of debt but to help companies and businesses to find ways to hire the unemployed ... to create jobs not tax us to death . The water ways of the gulf employee thousands of people but I did not see the kind of action from our President that would indicate he really cared . His words ring hollow to the ears of many , we are tired of his words and we are tired of the hopeless policies he has placed on our country , our waterways and our borders .

Lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced legislation that would raise to $ 10 billion the maximum amount of cash oil companies would be required to pay for economic losses . The White House has also expressed support for raising the cap on damages from the current $ 75 million . This plan , however , would apply not only to new leases but also to those existing leases where contract terms have already been agreed . This could present a problem , according to Jack Coleman , who served for more than a decade as the Interior Department 's senior attorney for royalties and offshore minerals . Coleman said the Supreme Court ruled in another case dealing with offshore energy production that laws in place at the time a lease is issued are still part of the contract . `` If you go about making substantial changes to those laws then you have breached the leases , '' he said . The Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee is set to hold a hearing on Tuesday on the liability issue . Lawmakers are seeking ways to bring the legislation up for a vote in Congress . Smaller energy companies operating offshore may not be able to remain insured with a liability cap at $ 10 billion and beyond . These companies could potentially sue the government , arguing they would have paid less or not bought their current leases if they knew their liability would rise . `` Clearly that 's the argument if I 'm the oil companies ' lawyers that I 'm going to be making , '' said Pat Parenteau , a professor of environmental law at the Vermont Law School . It 's unlikely that the government would be able to apply the cap only to BP , because that would raise constitutional issues regarding basic fairness and due process , Parenteau said . Whether that claim holds `` really comes down to what was the reasonable expectation that BP had when it bought these leases , '' Parenteau said . Jeffrey Rachlinski , of Cornell Law school , disagreed with the idea that the government 's changes to the cap for existing leaseholders may not stand up in court . `` The liability provisions are not part of the leases , they are part of federal law , '' Rachlinski said . `` Contractual provisions always give way to substantive law . '' For its part , BP said it will ignore the $ 75 million cap and pay all legitimate economic claims . Whether these public statements legally bind the company to uphold this pledge is up for debate . Some argue BP 's promises show the company is willing to amend its current lease contract in the case of this particular accident and the government will be able hold BP accountable for claims beyond the cap even if no new liability law is passed . Others say this is unclear . `` The existing law is pretty clear , '' said John Pendergrass , a senior attorney at the Environmental Law Institute . `` Their voluntary statements or even writing saying that they 're not going to take advantage of that legal right , I 'm not sure that would hold up .

While they 're at , if they can find time between non-stop curtseying to big business at any price , it would be nice to hear them explain whose idea it was to create a cap to begin with . And how much they got paid to do so . How about this ... pay up buttercup or your lease is recinded . I have a feeling the reason for all of the reticence about any legislation is to set up a `` grandfather clause '' that will give current leaseholders super profits !

LOS ANGELES | Mon May 24 , 2010 11:02 pm EDT LOS ANGELES -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - More than 300 sea birds , nearly 200 turtles and 19 dolphins have been found dead along the U.S. Gulf Coast during the first five weeks of BP 's huge oil spill off Louisiana , wildlife officials reported on Monday . The 316 dead birds collected along the shores of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida -- plus 10 others that died or were euthanized at wildlife rehabilitation centers after they were captured alive , far outnumber the 31 surviving birds found oiled to date . The raw tally of birds listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as dead on arrival at wildlife collection facilities include specimens obviously tainted with oil and some with no visible signs of oil contamination . But all are being counted as potential casualties of the oil gushing since April 20 from a ruptured wellhead on the floor of the Gulf because of their proximity in time and space to the spill , said Jay Holcomb , who directs a rescue center for birds in Fort Jackson , Louisiana . The same is true of nearly 200 sea turtles found dead and dying along the Gulf Coast , and 19 dead dolphins verified in the region since the oil drilling blowout on April 20 . Tissue samples collected eventually will be analyzed to determine more conclusively if the animals were contaminated with oil from the BP spill . Holcomb , director of the California-based International Bird Rescue Research Center , said mortality for sea birds , many of them in the midst of their breeding season , is expected to climb sharply , especially if hurricanes move into the region and sweep more oil ashore . `` The potential for this being catastrophic is right there because there 's a massive amount of oil in the water , and it 's still pouring out , and there 's a lot of nesting birds and a lot of birds using the coast , '' he told Reuters . `` If the tropical storms take that oil and move it , that 's when you 're going to see the real impact , I think . '' The size of BP 's disaster in the Gulf could eclipse the scale of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska 's Prince William Sound , in which an estimated 250,000 sea birds perished . DIVING BIRDS HARDEST HIT SO FAR The birds hardest hit by oil in the Gulf so far are those that feed by diving into the water for fish , including the Louisiana state bird , the brown pelican , removed last year from the U.S. endangered species list , and the northern gannet , Holcomb said . But shorebirds , wading birds and songbirds will increasingly be put in harm 's way as more oil washes onto beaches and into marshlands . Oil impairs the insulating properties of birds ' feathers , exposing them to cold and making it difficult for them to float , swim and fly . Chemicals in the petroleum also can burn their skin and irritate their eyes . They also end up ingesting the oil when they preen , damaging their digestive tracts . Other wildlife at immediate risk in the Gulf are sea turtles and marine mammals . To date , 209 sea turtles have been found dead or debilitated along the Gulf Coast , about double the number reported late last week , a tally that wildlife officials said then could be considered normal for this time of year . The latest figure includes 194 that washed ashore dead and 12 that were found stranded alive , two of which later died in rehab , said Dr. Michael Ziccardi , a veterinarian and professor at the University of California at Davis who is overseeing sea turtle and marine mammal rescue teams in Louisiana . Three remaining turtles in the latest tally were found heavily oiled at sea but have survived , he said . Those three are the only ones with outward signs of oil contamination . Necropsies , the animal equivalent of autopsies , have been performed on 40 turtle carcasses found intact , and a majority of the findings pointed to drowning or the aspiration of bottom sediments as the cause of death , Ziccardi said . Although the results are `` inconsistent with oil exposure as a primary cause of death , '' lab tests of tissue samples are still pending , so less visible factors remain to be determined , he said . Nineteen dolphin deaths also have been confirmed since the spill began , but none of those animals showed any obvious external or internal signs of oiling , Ziccardi said . -LRB- Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Sandra Maler -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1151", "dct": "2010-05-25", "dates": ["2010-05-25", "2010-05-25", "2010-05-25"], "text": "HOUSTON | Tue May 25 , 2010 2:22 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Insurer Lloyd 's of London has asked a U.S. court to block a claim filed by oil major BP seeking damages against driller Transocean , which drilled the well which is currently gushing crude into the Gulf of Mexico . Lloyds underwriting syndicates and other insurers who provided $ 700 million of cover to Transocean lodged a case with a federal court in Houston , arguing that the policies provided to Transocean preclude claims related to environmental damage caused by leaks from the well . According to court documents , the insurers argue that Transocean 's contract with BP only makes it liable for environmental damage caused by any spills from its rig , which exploded and sank , causing the pipe running from the rig to the well to snap . The well is leaking oil . BP said it had lodged a claim against the insurers but declined to comment further . No one was available for comment at Transocean . Even if BP was awarded the full $ 700 million of cover the insurers provided to Swiss-based Transocean , it would be only a small fraction of the total bill for the cleanup operation and compensating people who suffered losses due to the spill .

The accident comes at a difficult time for BP -- the largest single owner of the pipeline operator , holding 47 percent -- as it struggles to plug a gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well . The shutdown followed a series of mishaps that resulted from a scheduled fire-command system test at Pump Station 9 , about 100 miles south of Fairbanks , said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co , the operator of the 800-mile oil line . The power outage triggered opening of relief valves , causing an unspecified volume of crude oil to overflow a storage tank into a secondary containment . There were no injuries , but the approximately 40 people at the work site were evacuated , Alyeska spokeswoman Michele Egan said . North Slope oil producers have cut their flow into the pipeline 's Prudhoe Bay intake station to 16 percent of their normal rates , Egan said . There is enough storage capacity to allow the line to be shut down for 48 hours as long as producers maintain the 16 percent flow rate , she said . It is unclear how long the shutdown will last . `` We 're going to take as long as we need to make sure the site is safe before we start back up , '' Egan said . Supply problems in the pipeline potentially disrupt tanker shipments to refineries . The volume of spilled oil is unknown . `` We 've estimated the spill is several thousand barrels , '' she said . All has been held within the secondary containment , which has capacity to hold 104,500 barrels , she said . The amount spilled is `` nowhere near '' the containment area 's capacity , she added . Alyeska is a consortium owned by five oil companies . Major owners are BP , ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil . Unocal and Koch hold minor shares .

The memo by Representatives Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak , who were briefed by BP about the progress of its internal investigation , also said problems were found in equipment meant to provide fail-safe protection against a blow out . A BP investigator indicated to the lawmakers that the fundamental mistake may have been made because heavy pressure on the drill line of 1,400 pounds per square inch -LRB- 98 kg per square cm -RRB- was an `` indicator of a very large abnormality . '' The memo did not indicate who made decisions after the problem was found . BP and Transocean , the owner and operator of the rig , had supervisors on the rig when it exploded . About two hours before the explosion that killed 11 workers and caused the leak that is still gushing oil , the rig team was satisfied a test on another line was successful , the BP investigator said . BP would not comment on the memo . A Transocean spokesman blamed BP for the disaster , saying , `` A well is constructed and completed the same way a house is built -- at the direction of the owner and the architect . And in this case , that 's BP . '' The congressional memo said BP data showed there were numerous problems with production equipment . Nearly five hours before the explosion , an unexpected loss of fluid was observed in the well 's riser pipe . That suggests `` there were leaks in the annual preventer , '' a rubber gasket in the blowout preventer , the memo said . Waxman and Stupak chair the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's investigative subcommittee , which has reviewed over 105,000 pages of internal documents from BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd , Halliburton Co , and blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron . The memo said the BP investigation has also raised concerns about the maintenance history , modification , and inspection of the blowout preventer . Officials from BP and Transocean are scheduled to testify before congressional panels on Thursday . According to BP , there also were three warning signs of problems with unwanted flow in the well starting 51 minutes before the explosion . About 18 minutes before the explosion abnormal pressure leaks of the fluids known as mud meant to keep oil and gas capped were observed and the pump was shut down . `` The data suggests that the crew may have attempted mechanical interventions at that point to control the pressure , but soon after , the flow out and pressure increased dramatically and the explosion took place , '' the memo said . -LRB- Reporting by Timothy Gardner , editing by Philip Barbara and Bill Trott -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

BP is under intense pressure from Obama to bring a swift end to the five-week-old leak that threatens an environmental catastrophe and a blow to Obama 's crisis-manager image . Undersea robots were helping to inject heavy fluids and ultimately cement pumped down about a mile to the sea-bed well , while BP chief executive Tony Hayward and U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu monitored operations together in Houston . `` The operation is proceeding as we planned it , '' Hayward said in a media briefing four hours after launching the `` top kill '' strategy to stanch the leak . `` It will be another 24 hours before we know whether or not this has been successful , '' he added . The embattled CEO stood by BP 's 60-70 percent odds of success . But top kill , a routine procedure on the surface , has never been attempted at such depths , prompting one industry expert to put the odds of success at less than 50 percent . `` You have got some of the smartest guys in the business trying to figure this out , but it has never been done before , '' David Pursell , partner at Houston investment bank Tudor , Pickering , Holt & Co , told Reuters Insider . `` I think the odds have to be 50 percent or less , '' he added . Obama said that if successful , BP 's plan to cap the well should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of hundreds of thousands of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of crude billowing into the Gulf . If it fails , `` there are other approaches that may be viable , '' he said on a trip to California . Obama , who has told aides to `` plug the damn hole , '' will head to Louisiana on Friday for the second time since the April 20 rig blast that killed 11 and unleashed the oil . BP says the next approach would be to install a containment device over the broken blowout preventer , a structure at the top of the well on the ocean floor , to try to stop the oil flow . It would attempt this in the next three or four days . It is still unclear how much oil is flowing from the well , but it is already shaping up to be the worst oil spill in U.S. history and a long-term threat to a rich ecosystem . The oil 's destruction of critical habitats continued to spread , with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal saying that more than 100 miles of the state 's 400-mile coastline were now affected . A BP statement said the top kill action began at 1 p.m. CST after the U.S. Coast Guard approved the operation , the most ambitious effort to date to cap the well . PIVOTAL DAYS FOR OBAMA , BP These days may be critical for the London-based energy giant and Obama . BP 's reputation and its big presence in the United States is at stake and investors , who have wiped $ 50 billion off BP 's market value since the start of the spill , will watch closely to see whether the latest attempt to seal the well works . BP shares seesawed in London trading , with investors boosting the share price about 2.6 percent at one point before it closed up 1.4 percent . BP 's announcement that it had launched the new operation came after London markets had closed . If the effort fails , Obama may have no choice but to take charge of the response . He has so far deflected calls for the government to take a more direct role and said BP has legal responsibility for fixing the mess . What he can do is unclear because the government does not have its own deepwater tools and technology and will have to rely on BP . But even with Obama applying constant pressure on the company , polls show that nearly half of Americans are unhappy with how he has handled it . That sentiment could play into the November elections that are widely expected to erode his Democratic Party 's control of the U.S. Congress . Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said if BP failed to plug the leak this week , Obama must seize personal control of the effort immediately . `` If this thing does n't work then the president ought to turn this over to the military . It has the command structure to bring in all the civilian agencies , '' said Nelson . Residents of the Gulf region are particularly concerned about the impact of spreading oil on wildlife and area shorelines , home to a lucrative fishing and tourism business . Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , one of the worst affected Louisiana coastal districts so far , sharply criticized BP executives and Coast Guard leaders , saying they had no comprehensive plan to defend the coast from the oil . `` We will lose more coastline from this catastrophe than from all four hurricanes -- Katrina , Rita , Gustav and Ike , '' said Nungesser . Commercial fishing , shrimping and oyster harvests have been shut down for weeks along much of the Gulf coast , home to a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry . BP said it had appointed an independent mediator to oversee damage claims . More than 26,000 claims have been submitted so far , resulting in payments of more than $ 36 million . BP has estimated that about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have been leaking every day , although some scientists have given much higher numbers for the size of the leak -- up to 20 times more . The head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Jane Lubchenco , told a congressional hearing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would provide a new estimate within two weeks on the amount of oil leaking from the well . `` It 's only been in the last couple of days that we have gotten video that was high enough resolution , long enough length and fast enough shutter speed to really do credible calculations , '' Lubchenco said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Yet , nobody actually says what he should do . What we 're seeing in the Gulf , is exactly what the GOP , Conservatives , Libertarians , etc , have been whining for , for decades -- - sparse Federal regulation , with Corporations monitoring themselves . Just like the financial meltdown , we 're seeing the result of that ideology . Yet , now they 're whining for Obama to do more -- - for more Federal intervention . The hypocrisy , kind of makes one 's mind explode . And sadly , due to the Corporate influence of the Federal Government , the Government is n't prepared to do anything . They do n't even have submersibles capable of working at that depth . Maybe Obama can dive down there himself , and pump all the GOP hot-air into the well , to equalize the pressure ... Several people need to go to jail for this but sadly no one will . We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication .

It could also help determine how much BP and others end up paying for the disaster . A clause buried deep in the U.S. Clean Water Act may expose BP and others to civil fines that are n't limited to any finite cap -- unlike a $ 75 million limit on compensation for economic damages . The Act allows the government to seek civil penalties in court for every drop of oil that spills into U.S. navigable waters , including the area of BP 's leaking well . As a result , the U.S. government could seek to fine BP or others up to $ 4,300 for every barrel leaked into the U.S. Gulf , according to legal experts and official documents . So far , analysts and experts calculating potential oil spill liabilities have mostly concentrated on the cost of the clean-up and compensation for economic damages to affected parties . Some have also discussed criminal liabilities . But the potential for civil fines has received scant attention -- and they could add up very quickly , depending on how aggressive the U.S. government is in pursuing them . The threat of hefty fines underscores the importance of quantifying how much oil is pouring into the Gulf . As BP seeks to staunch the leak that has now been gushing for at least 33 days , it has estimated a spill rate of 5,000 barrels per day . But some experts say the volume -- and hence the fines -- could be more than 10 times higher . The little-known , seldom applied clause in the Clean Water Act was added in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , and was intended to beef up the arsenal of penalties the government can apply to oil spillers to deter future disasters . `` These civil penalties could be staggeringly high , possibly running into the billions , '' said Professor David Uhlmann , director of the Environmental Law program at University of Michigan . Total liability -- including civil fines as well as the cost of clean-up , economic damages and potential criminal liability -- `` will run into the billions and may be in the tens of billions , '' Uhlmann said . Under the Clean Water Act , the Environmental Protection Agency can seek in federal court to fine any party whose negligence results in an oil spill in U.S. federal waters . Other companies involved at the Horizon platform and the oilfield could share liability with BP , experts said . They include rig-owner Transocean Ltd , cementing contractor Halliburton Co. , blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron , and Anadarko and Mitsui , which also hold stakes in the oilfield . The basic fine , according to the act , is $ 1,100 per barrel spilled . But the penalty can rise to $ 4,300 a barrel if a federal court rules the spill resulted from gross negligence . The fines were originally set at $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 but that was raised in 2004 to keep up with inflation , according to Tracy Hester , head of the Environmental Law and Policy program at the University of Houston . -LRB- To see an EPA memo on 2004 revisions to penalties outlined in the Clean Water Act , click here : here -RRB- It is unclear , however , that the EPA would try to apply the fines , or seek maximum penalty levels . EPA officials did not respond to several calls and e-mails requesting comment . If the agency does act , the per-barrel fines could push oil companies ' liability well beyond the cost of cleaning up the spill and paying legitimate claims for economic damages it causes , experts told Reuters . `` There are civil fines that could be quite substantial . I think BP 's exposure to this is far greater than people initially thought , '' said Harvard Law School professor Jody Freeman , who recently served in the White House as Counselor for Energy and Climate Change . BP has already said it will voluntarily exceed a $ 75 million cap on liability for economic damages , pledging to pay any `` legitimate claim '' it receives . But the civil fines are another wild card . BP spokesman Mark Salt said the company had nothing further to add to what it has said about the costs of the oil spill response . Cash raised from such fines would be funneled to government pollution funds , which provide economic aid for hazardous material spills . BP or other parties facing fines could appeal them , or try to settle with the government for a lesser amount . Another option would be for BP or other responsible parties to seek a far-ranging settlement covering various areas of liability . `` The amount of barrels being released from the well is going to be critical , '' said Hester of the University of Houston . Under pressure over the government 's response to the disaster , President Barack Obama last Friday created a bi-partisan commission on the spill , and the administration has pledged to independently verify the volume of oil leaking into the Gulf . `` We 're not depending on what BP is telling us , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told CNN last week . After past oil spills , experts said , civil fines have comprised a modest proportion of total liability , but they said the magnitude of the Gulf spill may lead the government to seek unprecedented penalties . It is common for the government to wait until an oil spill clean-up is well underway before pursuing civil penalties , experts said . Authorities would also need an accurate accounting of the spill volume before seeking the fines . Bernstein Research estimated in late April that BP 's liability could reach $ 8 billion , but that figure did n't include any potential penalties . BP 's stock price has plunged by around 30 percent since deadly explosions rocked the Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20 , setting off an oil leak that may become the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history . An EPA legal document leaked online and viewed by Reuters shows the agency evaluated applying per barrel civil fines on BP for a 5,000-barrel oil spill in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay in 2006 . The EPA and U.S. attorneys declined to confirm or deny the contents of the document , which was found on a whistleblower website called peer.org . When the penalty clause was introduced into the Clean Water Act by Senator Joseph Lieberman 16 years earlier , he argued that caps on spill liability might lead oil companies to take undue risk . `` Large civil penalties ... are also especially important because , in certain cases , the liability of the spiller for clean-up costs under federal law is limited , '' Lieberman told Congress in 1990 , according to congressional records . `` Aggressive penalties may need to compensate for this limited liability , '' he told Congress at the time . If BP 's estimated spill rate of 5,000 barrels per day is accurate , responsible parties could face civil fines between $ 5.5 million and $ 21.5 million per day , depending on levels of negligence . BP 's net profits in the first quarter of 2010 were around $ 6.7 million per day . Other companies may share responsibility and face a portion of the civil fines , lawyers said . `` I would expect the government to go after BP and other parties for the maximum civil fines , '' said William Bode , managing partner at the Bode & Grenier law firm in Washington . `` The case could be brought in a Louisiana court where it would most likely succeed , although it might be settled for less than the maximum . '' Any gross negligence ruling against BP or others could depend on whether the companies knew they were taking undue risks in the Gulf , lawyers said . `` If a driller like BP knew or should have known about a condition that could lead to a disaster , it might face gross negligence , '' said a lawyer and insurance underwriter who does business with BP and asked not to be named . If the government pursues civil fines based on the volume of oil spilled , it would take into consideration whether companies have made their best effort to mitigate the spill , their prior history of offenses , if any , and whether they can bear the cost of fines , among other factors , experts said . BP received the third-largest criminal penalty , of $ 50 million , for an environmental offense in U.S. history for a Texas City refinery fire in 2005 . BP subsidiaries remain under federal probation for prior offenses in Texas and Alaska . `` There 's only so much blood you can get from a stone , '' Uhlmann said . `` I do n't think bankrupting BP will be the goal . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . In a world that offers multiple renewable resources this oil spill and the irresponsible actions of BP should stand as deacons for how AFFORDABLE change can be . Please ... 4300 per barrel ... as if we have never seen the long term damage and clean up of MINOR oil spills .

Apache Corp -LRB- APA . N -RRB- CEO Steve Farris , a senior executive at the company for two decades , said he does his best to remain calm and keep the gushing well in perspective . But the first thing he does when he wakes at 5 a.m. is seek out the latest news developments . `` It has a psychological effect not only on America , but our industry , and you try to overcome that , '' Farris told the Reuters Global Energy Summit in Houston this week . On top of the environmental catastrophe , the loss of 11 lives in last month 's Deepwater Horizon explosion has left a deep emotional impact on the close-knit drilling community . Apart from the possibility that it could happen to one of their own rigs , executives worry about the pall BP Plc 's -LRB- BP . L -RRB- blown-out well has cast over a deepwater drilling sector that once had a persistently sunny outlook . Black & Veatch Chief Executive Len Rodman , whose company does engineering for energy projects , said huge tragedies have changed the trajectory of the energy business before , such as the partial core meltdown in a unit at Pennsylvania 's Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979 . `` That disaster literally put a stop to nuclear power in the U.S. , '' Rodman said at the summit . `` I 'm not sure Three Mile Island was as big as what has happened -LRB- in the Gulf -RRB- . '' `` What I worry about as an energy CEO is what effect this will have on energy policy , '' he said , noting it may lead people to look more seriously at electric cars , or complicate plans to pump carbon underground . `` This BP thing has tentacles . '' Along with the public at large , industry players were crossing their fingers on Thursday in hopes the latest attempt to plug the well would be successful . Dave Roberts , head of worldwide upstream operations at Marathon Oil Corp -LRB- MRO . N -RRB- , spoke frankly about everything that went wrong and the looming political fallout . `` These things just should n't happen , '' Roberts said , citing the industry 's obligation to keep equipment working and its people safe . `` On this particular incident , the industry has failed that obligation , and we 're obviously very concerned about it . '' Even energy lobbyists are changing their tack . Catherine Reheis-Boyd , president of the Western States Petroleum Association , readily conceded at a debate in San Francisco last week that what happened with the Horizon was a `` game-changer . '' -LRB- Reporting by Braden Reddall ; editing by Gunna Dickson -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The spill has shown -LRB- once again -RRB- industry promises they will assure safe and environmentally sound operational practices are a sham . The Russians executed the chief of operations at Chernobyl for playing similar games with the reactor . The Supreme Court just gave corporations the right to vote . Does that mean they can also be given the death penalty ? There are a lot of us who 'd like to give BP a lethal injection after this . While , the reaction of the leading executives to the incident in the gulp is a sign that leadership in the industry is becoming more connected with the possibilities of failures leading to similar catastrophes , much of the responsibility sits with the various boards of directors and the governance procedures which are supposed to guide them . The Basel agreement and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were intended to restore investor and public confidence in the corporate world . However , while the recent economic crises illuminated the tendency for corporate management to act in favor of short term profit instead of the long term health of the companies in violation of the general ethics framework of corporations , management apparently focused solely on financial adjustments , which have been successful , they neglected the impacts that their businesses have on jobs , environment and safety . It must also be pointed out that not all of the blame lies with management . Big corporations do n't get big without support from customers . There are no record profits unless the companies can sell their products . So much of the blame for many of the incidents should be shouldered by the consumers . Constructive criticism should always be welcomed and considered , but pointing fingers and expecting large corporations or the government to always fix things is to deny personal responsibility each of us holds during these events . While we , as consumers complain about the high price of goods and services , in this case petroleum products , we need to ask ourselves what we are actually doing to help . It is certainly hypocritical for us to pass all of the blame , when part of it is ours . So , what can we do ? We can take baby steps and use a little less product . It was the constant use by many people that drove prices up according to basic laws of economics . Shortage of products creates demand . Shortage is the mechanism of supply and demand . So drive a little less by combining trips ; use reusable bags during shopping trips ; use a bicycle to commute occasionally ; put trash where it belongs instead of using the ground as a dump which requires more labor and fuel to collect . These actions are small , but multiplied by the population of the US or the world makes a difference . As for me , I just bought a bicycle to make short trips to the store , library , etc. . Many people have bikes , but it becomes a status symbol where the clothes are the prettiest , and the act becomes snob appeal . It 's time we put that natural energy source to work . Once we have cleaned up our own act by getting up off our butts and doing something to help , then the complaining carries more weight . This is my perhaps first comment that could be viewed in light of partial defense of BP 's CEO . A CEO does n't know what 's going on every second in terms of the workers and bad judgement calls further down the chain of command that are n't relayed back up every second . There is some blame to put here of course . I think what will become more of a focus down the road will be the workers whom had knowledge in the weeks leading up to this event -- about the shredded rubber from the seal that an operator had caused by negligence . CBS news had an interview with one of the survivors and he hand recounted before the explosion -- that an operator had through human error , caused mechanics to basically shred a rubber seal . This was most likely hid from the higher ups including the CEO to save jobs within the company from the company , which makes this all the more depressing when it comes to the industry . Some basic questions will have to be asked . Did we stop flying all planes when one pilot was found to be drunk ? Does any airline condone that ethical practice ? Does any employee that engages in that act , after the fact inform his higher ups out of moral obligation if not caught ? If that kind of act kills people or causes a lot of damage , do we scrap airplanes ? That kind of relation to put this in perspective shows how one person can damage an entire process\\/industry .

'' But it turns out he did have an opinion about future judgment about past actions . `` I 'm confident that people are going to look back and say that this administration was on top of what was an unprecedented crisis . '' Did he regret calling for expanded offshore drilling before the spill ? Obama said he continues to believe that `` domestic oil production is an important part of our overall energy mix , '' but is insufficient to meet future needs , which is why investment in clean energy is needed . A handful of oily sand grabbed from a Louisiana wetland brought back some strong memories for Earl Kingik . As a traditional hunter and whaler in Alaska 's Arctic , it reminded him of the Exxon Valdez spill . As he and other tribal leaders toured the U.S. Gulf Coast for signs of the BP oil spill , they worried that what 's happening now in Louisiana could happen if offshore drilling proceeds off the Alaskan coast . `` There 's no way to clean up an oil spill in the Arctic , '' said Kingik , an Inupiat tribal member from Point Hope , Alaska . Compared to Louisiana , where the waters are relatively calm and cleanup equipment and experts are nearby , the Arctic Ocean is a hostile place for oil and gas exploration . The Arctic leaders made their pilgrimage to the Gulf Coast as part of a campaign to block planned exploratory drilling by Shell Oil in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas . `` What I saw was devastating out there , '' Martha Falk , the tribal council treasurer of the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope in Alaska , said after the Gulf Coast tour by seaplane , boat and on foot . If the same thing occurred off Alaska , she said , `` We would have to wait days and days and days for -LRB- cleanup -RRB- equipment to reach our area . '' May 24 , 2010 21:58 UTC The message from the White House podium today was loud and clear -- there is no magic fix for the oil spill that looks like curdled chocolate milk flowing on top of the Gulf of Mexico .

Can government push BP out of the way if it believes the company is not doing the job ? `` Well , to push BP out of the way would raise a question -- to replace them with what ? '' Admiral Thad Allen of the Coast Guard , the administration 's response chief for the disaster , asked back . May 11 , 2010 20:24 UTC With the spotlight shining on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , and on the executives sizzling in the hot seat on Capitol Hill , environmental advocates are looking north . `` The May 28 report deadline still leaves ample time should the Department of the Interior choose to allow this ill-advised drilling to move forward in extreme Arctic conditions , where spill response faces additional challenges of sea ice , seas of up to 20 feet , darkness and a virtual lack of infrastructure from which to stage a response , '' the environmental groups -- Alaska Wilderness League , Center for Biological Diversity , Defenders of Wildlife , Earthjustice , Sierra Club and The Wilderness Society -- said in a statement . May 10 , 2010 20:07 UTC With BP 's spilled oil shimmering off the U.S. Gulf Coast , and a re-tooled bill to curb climate change expected to be unveiled this week in the U.S. Senate , what could be more appropriate than a bouquet of new environmental polls ? Conducted on behalf of groups that want less fossil fuel use , the polls show hefty majorities favoring legislation to limit emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide . In the kind of harmonic convergence that sometimes happens inside the Capital Beltway , a new poll released on Monday by the Clean Energy Works campaign showed `` overwhelming public support for comprehensive clean energy legislation , '' with 61 percent of 2010 voters saying they want to limit pollution , invest in clean energy and make energy companies pay for emitting the carbon that contributes to climate change . A healthy majority -- 54 percent -- of respondents said they 'd be more likely to re-elect a senator who votes for the bill . Last Friday , the Natural Resources Defense Council , which has been pushing for climate change legislation for years , released its own poll numbers . NRDC 's pollsters found seven in 10 Americans want to see fast-tracked clean energy legislation in the wake of the BP oil spill , and two-thirds say they want to postpone new offshore drilling until the Gulf oil spill is investigated and new safeguards are put in place . There 's not much to offer by way of comfort to coastal states threatened by the oil spill that 's spreading over the Gulf of Mexico like The Blob from horror movies past . And then there 's also the threat from the `` Loop Current '' that could carry the oil around Florida 's peninsula and north ... So there 's not much by way of lemonade likely to come out of the lemons of this disaster , but President Barack Obama promised to work overtime to limit the economic damage to affected communities and to try and make sure that jobs created to clean up the mess would go to local residents .

L -RRB- said on Thursday . There was no attempt to prevent the public from watching efforts to plug the leak from the damaged well , a BP spokesman said . `` It 's just operational , '' said BP spokesman Jon Pack . `` The camera that was closest to the riser got mud on its lens '' . Last week BP began broadcasting video images of its leaking underwater oil well , following pressure from U.S. Congressional leaders concerned about the lack of progress in halting what is now the largest oil spill in U.S. history . Since then the images have focused on a plume of black crude oil flowing from a pipe , called a riser , which is connected to the well head . However , on Thursday all video has been of the equipment at the top of the well . On Wednesday BP began its latest attempt to plug the well , in an operation dubbed `` top kill '' , involving pumping heavy drilling fluid into the blow out preventer , a heavy piece of equipment that sits on top of the well . The goal is to stall the flow of oil with the heavy fluids and then pump concrete into the well to shut if off for good . Some of the mud being pumped into the blow out preventer traveled up the riser , expanding the plume of leaking oil , and this was what obstructed the camera , Pack said . He said he was unaware if it would be possible to solve the problem and restore images of the leaking riser . On Thursday BP said it was making progress on plugging the ruptured well as U.S. government figures showed the disaster has eclipsed the previous worst U.S. oil spill caused when the Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound . BP shares jumped 6.0 percent in London on the comments from BP and from the U.S. Coast Guard suggesting the flow of oil had already been restricted by the pumping of the drilling mud into the blow out preventer . The success or failure of the latest operation to stop the oil spill will continue to move the company 's shares , analysts at French bank Societe Generale said in a research note on Thursday . The oil company is aware that traders are watching the live video link closely for signs that the operation has succeeded but has warned that images from the seabed will be an unreliable indicator of progress .

On May 17 , there were at least 130,000 barrels of oil on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , and a similar amount had been skimmed off the surface or evaporated , according to a panel of government scientists known as the Flow Rate Technical Group . The findings , made public by U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt , confirm that more oil has been spilled from BP 's leaking well than the estimated 257,000 barrels that fouled Alaska 's Prince William Sound by the grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker . If the panel 's calculations are accurate , a total of at least 260,000 barrels of oil had spilled into the ocean by May 17 . The high-end estimate of oil on the water that day was 270,000 barrels , with a similar amount contained or evaporated , the panel found . McNutt declined to confirm that the BP spill has eclipsed the Exxon Valdez , but she did not dispute it . `` This is obviously a very , very significant environmental disaster and I think with the numbers I 've given you , you can do the math , '' McNutt said . The team 's best estimate for the amount of oil pouring from the well is 12,000-19 ,000 barrels per day , though one of three measurement methods the team used returned a high-end rate of 25,000 barrels per day , McNutt said .

L -RRB- deepwater spill in the U.S. Gulf will change the way the industry operates for ever , just as the Piper Alpha rig fire two decades ago rewrote the rule book , oil executives told the Reuters Global Energy Summit . After a fatal explosion last month , the Deepwater Horizon rig , leased by the British oil major , is still pumping crude into the water in one of the worst spills in U.S. history . In response , the United States is expected to issue new safety rules on Thursday -LRB- ID : nN26238003 -RRB- and other governments have also taken swift action . The industry says preventing further accidents is crucial , but it also says regulations will drive up costs and slow down future exploration , with knock-on effects for the oil price . `` We are concerned about future underwater oil drilling . That may have implications for slower or less drilling offshore . Regulation is necessary , but that should not hamper the long-term offshore drilling , '' said Nobuo Tanaka , executive director of the International Energy Agency , which advises industrialized nations . Addressing the Reuters summit , he said the IEA expected in response to adjust its future supply expectations in its medium-term outlook . The Deepwater Horizon explosion , which left 11 dead , has revived painful memories of the Piper Alpha oil platform explosion and fire in the British North Sea , which killed nearly 170 people in 1988 , making it the world 's worst offshore oil disaster . `` I think Piper Alpha had a permanent impact . It changed how platforms were designed , '' said Brian O'Cathain , chief executive of Irish oil and gas services company Petroceltic -LRB- PCI . `` I think this will change how people do deep water operations . '' African independent oil and gas company Afren said it had already experienced a 7-8 percent increase in costs for a project in Ghana following the safety response of Ghanian authorities . `` They have imposed some regulations and they are sensible , '' Osman Shahenshah , chief executive of Afren -LRB- AFRE . L -RRB- , told the Reuters energy summit . He predicted deepwater exploration , which is extensive off western Africa , would be slowed `` a little bit , '' but the industry was more than ready to regulate . `` I think the industry will do it voluntarily , even it is not imposed , '' he said . `` Nobody wants to go through what BP is going through . '' Oil executives were equally sure that whatever the difficulties , deepwater exploration would continue because of the need for oil and the limited opportunities for conventional exploration . `` I am sure that there is going to be continued investment in deep offshore , '' Ayman Asfari , the chief executive of UK services company Petrofac , said . -LRB- PFC. L -RRB- `` The world ca n't afford not to do that , but I think it may slow down until there are new regulations . '' Any slow-down leads oil executives to the possibility of future supply crunches and rising prices once energy demand recovers from economic crisis . `` I 'm not an economist , but I can tell you what 's absolutely sure is that all the delays that have happened , all the delays that could potentially happen in the Gulf of Mexico , we 're going to pay one day , '' said Thierry Pilenko , the chief executive of oil services company Technip -LRB- TECF . `` I do n't know whether it 's in 18 months or in two years , but at some stage everybody will be screaming for resources .

Thu May 27 , 2010 12:32 pm EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A team of government and independent experts on Thursday released its `` overall best initial estimate '' of the oil flowing from BP Plc 's blown-out Gulf of Mexico well . The Flow Rate Technical Group 's estimate is a range from 12,000 barrels per day -LRB- 504,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million liters -RRB- to 19,000 bpd -LRB- 798,000 gallons\\/3 .02 million liters -RRB- , well above BP 's estimate of 5,000 bpd . The team said it used three separate techniques to arrive at the estimate . Those three measurements are : MASS BALANCE ESTIMATE : 12,000-19 ,000 barrels per day The mass balance team calculated the amount of oil on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , using a NASA imaging spectrometer previously used to discover water on the surface of the moon . The team also estimated that between 130,000 barrels and 270,000 barrels of oil were on the ocean surface on May 17 , and a similar amount had been dispersed , skimmed or evaporated . PLUME MODELING ESTIMATE : 12,000-25 ,000 bpd The plume modeling team used video from remotely operated vehicles at the ocean floor to observe oil and natural gas escaping from the well 's riser pipe . The team used advanced imaging analysis to estimate fluid velocity and flow volume . RISER INSERTION TUBE TOOL ESTIMATE : at least 11,000 bpd This team studied oil being collected by a siphoning device called a riser insertion tube that BP has used to collect some oil directly from one of the two leak sites . On May 25 , the tool logged a collection rate of 8,000 barrels per day , the team said , as measured by a meter verified by a third party . The team estimated that at least 10 percent of the flow was not collected by the siphon , and that additional oil was escaping from a second leak site . The Flow Rate Technical Group is comprised of federal scientists , independent experts , and academic experts . Included are members of the U.S. Geological Survey -LRB- USGS -RRB- , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Energy Department , Coast Guard , Minerals Management Service , National Institute of Standards and Technology , University of California Berkeley , University of Washington , University of Texas , Purdue University , and several other academic institutions . BP is not involved except to supply raw data , USGS said .

These creatures normally live in the Arctic Ocean , not the Gulf of Mexico , but they 're listed as `` sensitive biological resources '' that could be affected by an oil spill in the area in a document filed by BP last June with the U.S. Minerals Management Service . More than a month after BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig blew out and sank on April 20 , the British oil giant 's regional spill response plan drew some severe criticism from the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility . One problem with BP 's nearly 600-page spill response plan ? `` It was utterly useless in the event of a spill , '' Jeff Ruch , PEER 's executive director , said by telephone . His group , which acts as a kind of safe haven for government whistle-blowers , detailed what it called `` outright inanities '' in BP 's filing and the government 's approval of it . PEER noted BP 's plan referred to `` sea lions , seals , sea otters -LRB- and -RRB- walruses '' as wildlife that might be affected in the Gulf of Mexico , and suggested this reference was taken from a previous plan for Arctic exploratory drilling , where these animals could be affected . The BP plan lists a Japanese shopping and search website as a link to one of its `` primary equipment providers '' for rapid deployment in the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico . And it directs its media spokespeople never to make `` promises that property , ecology or anything else will be restored to normal . '' Ruch said the plan contains no information about tracking sub-surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts or preventing disease transmission to captured animals in rehab facilities , a serious risk after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill . The section on `` worst case discharge '' estimates a maximum spill of 177,400 barrels in the Gulf of Mexico . A panel of U.S. experts estimated that as of May 17 , there were at least 130,000 barrels of oil on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico and a similar amount had been skimmed off the surface or evaporated , making a total of at least 260,000 barrels from the Deepwater Horizon spill . As of May 27 , the broken well was still leaking .

Hopefully they will employ that expertise to seek the maximum possible punishments for what appears to be a willful disregard by BP of its legal obligation to develop a legitimate spill response plan . Check the relative salaries of environmental professionals employed by oil companies and their consultants and then the salaries of production engineers and accountants . It is no mystery why the environmental response plan is a cut and paste job . I was an environmental consultant for 15 years and continue to work in the environmental profession . There is no excuse for a cut and paste job regardless of salary ; I see it all the time . And to think , our oh-so-competent Federal Government approved that response plan . I wonder if BP has decided that their ROI for the Obama Campaign in 08 was a huge waste of money . THAT 's where the dividend money went .

The word at the White House is that Obama is frustrated at the delays BP has encountered in stopping the leak . `` Plug the damn hole , '' he has told senior government officials . The most immediate concern is stopping the leak . The problem for the White House is that it has no real alternative except to rely on BP 's technology and expertise to do it . That means Obama is forced into an uneasy alliance with BP -- outraged that the leak took place but hopeful that the energy giant can stop it . Has the Obama administrations ' response to the Gulf oil spill been enough ? Take our poll and share your thoughts below . Do you approve of President Obama s response to the Gulf oil spill ? Should the federal government be ordered to take over operations from BP ? PHOTO : U.S. President Barack Obama talks after touring the Coast Guard Venice Center in the Gulf of Mexico region to view environmental damage caused by the sinking of BP 's oil and gas Deepwater Horizontal drilling rig while in Venice , Louisiana , May 2 , 2010 . REUTERS\\/Larry Downing The BP executives that knew `` harm could come '' BEFORE the spill occurred and did nothing stop it , should be fired . BP is criminal and should be treated as such . Their continued rape of our planet is ridiculous . Somebody needs to stand up to them NOW . IF we listen to the GOP these are our choices : 1 -RRB- Lower taxes and smaller government with limited leadership that allows industry to write it 's own rules that are backed up by taxpayer funded bailouts . 2 -RRB- Higher taxes to fund bigger government that is capable of bailing out private industries when they are incompetent to deal with problems they cause ? The GOP does n't care about America or our health and safety . They are only capable of playing politics and have no real ideas , as usual . Ideology is not what America needs now . The BP-Tansocean-Halliburton disaster is a perfect example of why we need to regulate all industries more closely and protect the environment and the Amercian public from those who seek only to profit from it . You 're rating Obama on this ??? You gotta be kidding . I 've got two words for ya . Sarah Palin was just interviewed by Katie Courich again : `` Oh Katie , it 's the ` GULF OF MEXICO ! ' It 's not our problem ! Drill baby ... DRILL ! '' Obama is at fault until his administration brings criminal charges . Then he 's still at fault until the BP decisionmakers are in prison . Obama is the best president EVER ! He is the clear reason why I only vote for Democrats . Thankfully Obama is in office for 8 years , so he can clean up the mess the Republicans created -LRB- everything bad that happens in the nation\\/world can be and will be attributed to Bush for the rest of time -RRB- only to hand off to the next Democratic president . My only concern is that the next president must be far , far more liberal . Remember : Only liberal Democrats need to be in office . They will help , protect , and give you what you need\\/want . Only they can save America . `` Do you approve of President Obama 's response ... ? '' Should n't it be `` ... the Obama ADMINISTRATION 'S response ? '' Or is the questioner seriously asking one man to do it all . Even with 911 and Kartina , no one asked Bush to handle everything ; we asked FEMA Director Michael -LRB- `` Heck of a job , Brownie '' -RRB- Brown to be competent and so forth . The same standard needs to apply here . The EPA and applicable agencies ' responses should be at issue , not those of one man . And most laughingly , `` Should the federal government be ordered ... ? '' Seriously , who wrote these ? It reads like a failed high school assignment . What would the Tea Party do if they were in charge ? What have the GOP leaders , who are continually re-elected by voters in the Gulf States , been doing with all the royalty money they collect from oil & gas companies for the privelege of drilling there ? They should have a huge slush fund put aside to deal with emergencies . Instead , the GOP leasdership looks to the Feds to save them . The same thing would be true in Alaska . Ask Lisa Murkowski what type of emergency fund she has developed with all her roaylty money ? What a bunch of lying hypocrites . A death sentence for GOP incumbents is the only answer , and maybe brain transplants for the voters who keep electing these shills . There are two parts to the question : 1 -RRB- Capping or stopping the release of oil from the well-head ; As to the first : BP has what expertize there is and should be `` point '' with Gov ' t oversight . In this regard , President Obama gets a `` c '' grade for his response . As to the second , Clean-up : President Obama gets a `` F '' grade . Obama and his team should have been like stink on sh_t , from day 2 ; the Army Corps should have been building sand dikes outside of beach and marshes ; Coast Guard and Navy should have been deploying booms and skimmers in concentric rings around the platform\\/up-welling areas . The Gov ' t should have taken over the clean-up and backcharged BP . BP should be barred from operating in US waters until they can pass a re-application test which would involve them building a full scale rig at a test site -LRB- NOT IN US WATERS -RRB- where government scientists and engineers could run any accident scenarios they wanted for at least TWO YEARS ! -LRB- a -RRB- because they lied about the readiness of the ` blowout preventor ' -LRB- b -RRB- did n't do sufficient testing with government inspectors on site 100 % of the test time . -LRB- BP should have demanded this ! -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- they ignored operational warnings about the overall performance of the rig . and -LRB- d -RRB- the most damning of all : BP had no DEMONSTRATED contingency plan for the case where the ` blowout preventor ' failed ! the government should impose a ` three strikes ' law for all industries working with food or in environmentally sensitive areas based on three level contingency plans . if all of the plans fail for any test scenario , then you 've ` struck out ' and you 're out of the game until you can pass a vastly more rigorous re-application test regime . I believe JBorrow is on to something . The fact all this is so under-regulated is amazing ! We -LRB- the US -RRB- are so greedy with oil and our unwillingness to sacrifice -LRB- god forbid -RRB- our SUV 's and lackluster efforts to improve efficiencies nationwide . Hopefully this administration will finally move forward on reducing emissions so our great grandchildren have clean air ... and in doing so lessen our ridiculous dependance on Oil , as we clearly go extremes , despite environmental impacts to our oceans , wildlife and eventually our own food source . This administration is doing far more then has been done in the past , though his concessions to the republicans have lessened the effectiveness of certain policies , its still a huge leap forward . The oil companies have made more money they know what to do with , and zero interest in safety . I believe serious regulation should be implemented , and hopefully this will be a final wake-up call for those who believe large industries should be left to run rampant in a free market society . wait , OB did his part ! he held up a tarball ! I hope some one HEARS this we can build ships in a day at war , and I say we are at war with this oil leak that BP loves because it means there is alot of oil for them . There are PLumes of oil that a tanker already fitted with pumps can suck up IT just takes a 100ft piece of pipe , Also we can build a scimmer ship and scim 12 inches of the top of the ocean treat -LRB- pull the oil out then keep the oil spit out the water there are ways and this is a war against this oil which is still coming out into the ocean soon to reach around florida and ruin much more . The Russians blew there run away oil hole to bits may be it is time to do the same not like they did it , but there are ways to just stop it but then BP would lose that hole they already put there , they care much more about that then the ocean death they are creating all day every day and all this other bull is `` being tried -RRB- I really hope someone is hears this , But CORP. will win out again and screw the earth we only live here . Obama being judged for this is like judging Sara Palin on her intelligence . What 's he supposed to do ; Dive down there -LRB- with a cigarette in his mouth -RRB- and stuff a sock in the pipe ? Regulations and laws had to be in place to authorize a president to act before this happened . Regs that Shrub disposed of . Can you imagine the screams of SOCIALIST if Obama acted to take over this company ? Obama 's job is to manage . He is elected to manage this country , and along with this to manage the blow-ups that come up . Where are experts called to testify , where are independant observers , where are other people who did this before ? While BP is trying to plug the hole , where is the concerted effort to keep the oil from reaching the shore ? He spends his weekend fishing with his pals -- this is not what a good manager should be doing with this kind of an issue to deal with . It is amazing to witness . Obama attacked for expanding government by Fixed News NeoCon Artists and TeaBaggers and now he is railed against by the same antagonists for not using enough government weight to solve a private enterprise calamity caused by the biggest GOP supporter : Big Oil . The same Big Oil that has paid off our politicians and supported GOP candidates for decades to stave off regulations , and ensure they will keep their obese profit margins ... all in the name of our so called ` free enterprise ' system . The `` DRILL BABY , DRILL '' idiots should be made to take a good long swim in the Gulf . Or , as the Fixed News talking heads are shouting , Obama should have the Government do more by identifying every person who was at a Sarah - 'D rill BABY , DRILL ' - Palin rally and force them into work camps along the Gulf until the mess is completely cleaned . Perhaps then they would finally open their eyes and see those they support for who they are . put your money where your mouth is . park your car , oil company haters . ooh , big oil , it runs the world . it rapes the planet . well , put them out of business . park your car , if you own one . and you better keep hoping the free enterprise system stays . it 's the only way faux-prez . barry can skim money for you incopentent libs you cant hold down a job . `` The President of the United States could 've come down here , he could 've been involved with the families of these 11 people '' who died on the rig after an explosion , James Carville said on ABC 's Good Morning America . `` He could be commandeering tankers and making BP bring tankers in and clean this up . They could be deploying people to the coast right now . He could be with the Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard ... doing something about these regulations . These people are crying , they 're begging for something down here , and it just looks like he 's not involved in this . '' His voice rising , Carville cried out , `` Man , you got to get down here and take control of this ! Put somebody in charge of this thing and get this moving ! We 're about to die down here ! '' thats sounds like a very innovative idea Dewayne , hope someone hears you out and considers it . It 's not enough to just be angry and frustrated . Obama needs to spend more time in the affected Gulf States just talking to people -- one at a time -- and trying to help them find solutions to their economic and environmental problems . One of his problems is that common folks do n't see him as relating very well to their real problems . Despite his experience in community organizing , he 's seen as detached and aloof . Interesting results -LRB- thus far -RRB- : Most respondents think Obama did n't do enough , and most think the government should let BP run the operation . People , please make up your mind because you confuse me . take it easy lefties . your man obama distanced himself from this disaster in order to not look to be close with that entity most despised by the left ; a `` big oil '' company . rather than the posturing of `` keeping our boot on the throat of bp '' , and starting criminal and civil investigations by that incompetent bumbler eric holder , obama would have been better off by taking the high road , and showing some real leadership by offering all the fed govt 's resources to work WITH bp . i guess he just does n't have it in him to do that . or plouffe , emmanuel and axelrod are advising him not to . by the way , getting involved in a crisis is not the same as expanding the government . This is wrong -- -RRB- '' The problem for the White House is that it has no real alternative except to rely on BP s technology and expertise to do it '' They could have an oil spill Czar , and consult with other engineers from the other super major oil companies , Chevron , Exxon-mobil , and verify the correct path . But they have n't even done the first step - appoint someone to be the executive in charge of the federal response , an oil czar . Who is in charge when Obama is on vacation or out with the Mexican President ? Someone needs to be in control of the Federal response even if BP is doing their work . The lack of concern from the Obama gross . They are virtually ignoring a spill that is now the largest in US history . Prevention is better than cure . Why did n't Boy George 's administration insist all offshore wells have actual working blowout preventers like Norway requires ? Why were they so lax in enforcing what few regulations they were willing to enforce ? This may have occurred on Obama 's watch , but all the preconditions were set in place by the pres and VP from the `` ahl bidniz '' . I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again , here . The ` Obama administration ' has but one boss . Saying it 's somehow not the PRESIDENT 's responsibility to intervene is pure and utter ignorance of US law -LRB- see below -RRB- and of the role the man is REQUIRED to play . You ca n't blame oil-boy Bush and not blame the federal government under Obama at the same time without what amounts to self-deception . Yes , of course BP should have had a contingency plan , but Obama is REQUIRED by law to have one . Of course Obama didn t cause the blowout . It doesn t let him off the hook . US Title 33 , Chap 40 , SubCh I 2706 & 2711 clearly spell out it s been Obama s responsibility for addressing it since day one . The National Contingency Plan referred is supposed to be in place ahead of time -LRB- not letting industry or previous administrations off the hook . They all bear responsibility , but saying We don t have the tech or training means We all did a pretty lousy job setting up a contingency plan . -RRB- The President , or the authorized representative of any State , Indian tribe , or foreign government , shall act on behalf of the public , Indian tribe , or foreign country as trustee of natural resources to present a claim for and to recover damages to the natural resources The President shall consult with the affected trustees designated under section 2706 of this title on the appropriate removal action to be taken in connection with any discharge of oil . For the purposes of the National Contingency Plan , removal with respect to any discharge shall be considered completed when so determined by the President in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected States . However , this determination shall not preclude additional removal actions under applicable State law If US citizenry decides he hasn t done a good job upholding that responsibility , and most recent polls suggest the majority think he hasn t , then there is opportunity for him to work harder to address that concern . Working with Gov. Jindal is mandated . If Gov. Jindal says during consultation that remediation needs to be stepped up or actions taken , Obama is obliged to listen . Yell all you like at prior oil-industry-linked administrations , but to be honest a President that ran on environmentally-sensitive statements and just trotted out a new energy plan that \\* supposedly \\* paid close enough attention to risks to justify limited drilling ought not to have been caught with his pants down when a rig accident happened . Cynics will begin to wonder if he allowed the burden to fall on BP to allow for a mess that proved his prior concerns regarding drilling . Of course BP needs to be held liable that s the letter of the law and restating it as if it showed leadership is a bit of a stretch . They lost all credibility sticking to the 5k per day number , which is most likely a crass attempt to avoid the per-barrel charges they know are coming . The message regarding the rather large number of involved personnel and materiel would be a better one for Obama to focus on , but until that stupid hole is plugged nothing else will do . Its amazing to me all the Bush bashing that takes place . WHAT EXACTLY HAS OBAMA DONE SINCE HE ENTERED OFFICE ????????????????? Do you feel safer in this country ??? He 's got about the same number of crooks in his cabinet as any other president . What do you expect . The gave Obama the Nobel Peace prize for doing nothing . -LRB- Which by the way now makes that once prized award completely worthless -RRB- and now you expect a different result -- - MORONS -- '' YOU '' voted for him , now deal with it . Obama is all talk and no action . We 'll make sure its fixed in 2012 . O and by the way , hows that new `` OBAMACARE '' plan workin for ya . Theres nothing like footing the bills for a bunch of illegals and people who dont want to work for a living , but keep working your tails off , millions on welfare depend on YOU !!! The energy companies have serious political clout in Washington ... I am wondering how much they contributed to his election campaign ... and how much he is hoping to garner for the next . the fed should not take over ... . . 59 % say they do n't approve of the fed 's -LRB- obama -RRB- response How many of the people who voted on this question even know what Obama 's options actually were ? BP must cork the leak . BP must pay for the cleanup . Were the government to say , `` Step aside , sonny , we 're in charge now , '' the taxpayers would end up footing the bill for this . Obama has done all he could . Posted by Fishrl | Report as abusive What CAN he do ? He should wave his hand and just make it stop spewing oil . Where are the Drill Baby Drill people now ? We never should have drilled so close to our shores unless there existed technology to take care of this type of problem . Were are the right wing nuts who pushed for off chore drilling ? Obama has done as much as he can . The environmental wackos pushed America so far off shore . We need to drill closer to shore and on land . I 'm sick of leftist nuts dictating the demise of our country . With Obama now so inept , such a socialist pacifist anti-free enterprise , should BP be forced to pay for the La. oil slicks that he would not allow Jindal to build ??? Should Fla. whack him for its spoilage ? Can this guy do anything but destroy our capitalistic framework ? His leftist policies have dealt blows to America , our allies , and our citizens . Yet , the MSM covers for this inept Alinskite . Some may be waking up as Dowd , The Post , even some mags . who are asking -- -- Is this the end of Rico ???? The Chicago Thug ? I think a `` Bell form '' it will be more exactly for the container . double walls for presure controle , engines for motion and then central `` sucking pipe '' . -LRB- sorry -RRB- engenieers could design the density of fluid to charge `` Bell walls '' . how ever , what 's deep it 's happend ? The plan is to dig another well by the end of August . That 's the plan . Burn off the oil inthe meantime and keep cleaning . What else can they do ? Get real about this . Americans want it all today or yesterday . That is a national trait . We are an impatient people . Do you expect the CEO to stand on the beach and wait this out , wringing his hands ? They go on with life and do what they have to do . The size of the disaster has grown beyond the Coast Guard to handle . It 's not Coast Guard Admiral 's fault . But the regular military has a far more robust chain of command and far more robust capability . Passing the National guard off to the States may appear to give President Obama cover , but the paralysis there hurts him more than it hurts local governors . President Obama may also be thinking too much like a lawyer . Sitting back and letting BP continue to screw up might work for a smaller scale problem , but it makes the U.S. government look inept or calloused at the larger scale of the currently understood Gulf Disaster . Another dangerous mistake is for the Obama administration to conclude that since the oil can not really be stopped -LRB- once it is in the water -RRB- that there is no reason to over exert itself as the oil comes ashore or into the marshes . But this is n't what the public needs right now . If the administration were to mobilize troops -LRB- and naval vessels -RRB- directly and on a grand scale . I would like to know who are these people that are ever polled about anything ? I read today that Obama 's approval rating was lower then ever and that America had lost faith in obama poll by the Washington Post . Funny thing is I work with people from nearly every spectrum and most all whom I speak with seem happy with Obama . There are a few who are not but they are usually faithful to the GOP and their bias disqualifies them , as does the few who are far left . Would n't it be lovely to see how many people were polled , what the language of the poll looked like and how many responded . I would love to see what the Washington Post considers the American People . They have been openly accused of reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims . I would advise Reuters to use a disclaimer with anything the Post reports . Marcus Brauchli , editor of The Washington Post , wrote in a memo to employees that was obtained by Reuters . ... '' We are not a national news organization of record serving a general audience ... '' So I ask you ... Whom do they serve ? Who pays for Obama s campaign travels during this mid-term election ? Obama , get back to work ! We need some help from the GOP concerning Obama 's campaign travels . Obama is the President and he should be running the country . Obama should not be spending my tax dollars to campaign for the Midterms . How much money is he spending on plane fuel , secret service , hotels , and food ? It all comes out of my tax dollars .

WASHINGTON | Thu May 27 , 2010 3:54 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama took responsibility for the U.S. response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on Thursday and extended for six months a moratorium on offshore drilling , dealing a potential setback to his own energy policy . Obama , who has come under increased pressure to show leadership over the spill , suspended planned exploration off the coast of Alaska , and canceled a pending lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico and a proposed lease sale off Virginia . Addressing reporters at the White House , a worn-looking Obama said even his daughter had asked him when the oil would stop leaking . `` In case you 're wondering who 's responsible , I take responsibility , '' he said , leaning over his podium . `` It is my job to make sure that every thing is done to shut this down , '' he said . The president rejected criticism that he and the federal government had not taken charge as BP Plc -LRB- BP . L -RRB- struggles to stop the gushing deep-sea oil well . `` There should n't be any confusion here . The federal government is fully engaged , and I 'm fully engaged , '' he said . `` From the moment this disaster began , the federal government has been in charge of the response effort . '' Offshore oil drilling is a key part of Obama 's efforts to rejig the country 's energy policy and a needed sweetener for gaining Republican support for a bill in the Senate . But the spill has forced him and fellow Democrats to rethink their support for such an expansion , which many environmentalists oppose . `` Extraction is more expensive and it is going to be inherently more risky , '' Obama said . `` That 's part of the reason you never heard me say , ` drill , baby , drill , ' because we ca n't drill our way out of the problem . '' The Obama administration ordered a halt in new drilling permits after BP 's oil rig , owned by Transocean -LRB- RIG . S , exploded in the Gulf on April 20 . Some U.S. lawmakers have called on the administration to lift the permit ban , at least for exploration in the shallow waters of the Gulf while keeping it in place in deeper waters where BP was operating . Mike Breard , an analyst at Hodges Capital Management , said the decision would force companies to move rigs to places such as Brazil , forcing the United States to import more and increasing the possibility of tanker accidents . `` You 're trading a risk of one type of spill for another type of spill , '' Breard said . Obama has established a presidential commission to investigate the causes of the spill , which by government estimates is the country 's largest ever . His announcement on Thursday was meant to amplify his administration 's response before that panel draws its own conclusions on what went wrong . The moratorium on permits to drill new deepwater wells will continue for a period of six months while the commission does its work . Political fallout has not been limited to legislation . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Liz Birnbaum , the head of Minerals Management Service , which oversees U.S. offshore oil drilling , had resigned . Obama said he had learned of the resignation on Thursday morning . He declared that reforms are needed in the government 's process for approving oil drilling permits and said the MMS suffered from a relationship with the oil industry that was `` scandalously close . '' Obama has come under increasing pressure to stop the spill and halt its environmental and economic consequences for Gulf states . BP , which has been publicly scolded by the president , was working on Thursday to plug the leaking well in a procedure known as `` top kill . '' Obama promised to hold BP accountable in the catastrophic spill and said his administration would do everything necessary to protect and restore the coast . `` We 're exploring any reasonable strategies to try and save the Gulf from a spill that may otherwise last until the relief wells are finished and that 's a process that could take months , '' Obama said .

Harrison said the BP spill , the largest in U.S. history , highlights the `` ugly side of our dependence on fossil fuels . '' `` It just points even more strongly for the need for all these technologies to be developed and encouraged . The oil that we make through our process is biodegradable oil . It is made on land . You do n't have those kinds of risks , '' Dillon said . A range of commercial-scale projects to develop cellulosic and algae biofuels are ready to be built , but the economic downturn , uncertainty in global financial markets and the lack of long-term U.S. government support is making it hard to raise capital , company officials said in a conference call . A massive jobs bill pending in Congress includes a $ 1-per-gallon tax credit for biodiesel retroactive to January 1 and valid through the end of 2010 . The bill also includes a 50-cent credit for fuel produced from biomass . More than 30 biofuel companies and trade associations have asked leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee to extend the cellulosic biofuel production tax credit to at least 2016 , and to make algae biofuel producers eligible , creating a renewable investment tax credit option . Wes Bolsen , chief marketing officer for Illinois-based Coskata Inc , said the recent move by French oil company Total to take an equity stake in Coskata is part of a growing commitment by oil companies to play a bigger role in advancing biofuels . Still , government policy support is critical to move forward to commercial production , he said . `` What we have is a technology that is ready today . We believe we can economically compete head to head with gasoline . We need the policy that is going to show we have the enduring commitment , '' he said . Coskata , founded four years ago , has a demonstration facility in Pennsylvania that can produce cellulosic ethanol from grass , trash , wood chips , and various crop residues . HR BioPetroleum Chief Operating Officer Martin Sabarsky said his company needs more government support if it is to proceed with a commercial algae-based biofuels facility in Hawaii . It has received support from Royal Dutch Shell oil company but is having problems securing needed private capital . Sabarsky recent discussions with Shell in light of the BP oil spill tragedy have further underscored the need for alternative fuels . `` They -LRB- Shell -RRB- have recognized ... that the age of easy oil is over , '' he said . -LRB- Reporting by Carey Gillam ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "735", "dct": "2010-05-27", "dates": ["2010-05-27", "2010-05-27", "2010-05-27", "1989-01-01", "2010-05-26", "2010-05-27", "2010-04-01", "2010-04-20", "2005-01-01", "2005-01-01", "2010-05-27", "2009-11-01", "2010-05-27", "1989-03-01", "2010-05-27"], "text": "WASHINGTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana | Thu May 27 , 2010 7:33 pm EDT WASHINGTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc said its high-stakes bid to plug a gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well was proceeding to plan on Thursday , while U.S. President Barack Obama fended off criticism he has been too slow to respond to the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Nearly 40 days into the disaster , the BP oil leak has now eclipsed the worst previous spill , the Exxon Valdez disaster on the Alaska coast in 1989 , according to new U.S. government estimates of the amount of oil spewing into the Gulf . BP 's `` top kill '' procedure launched on Wednesday could choke off the well a mile down on the sea floor , but BP said it needs another 24 hours or longer to know the outcome . A day before he visits the Gulf for the second time , Obama vowed to hold BP accountable and said he was `` angry and frustrated '' at the London-based company 's failure to plug the leak . `` In case you 're wondering who 's responsible , I take responsibility , '' he told a White House news conference . `` It is my job to make sure everything is done to shut this down . '' He announced a six-month extension of a moratorium on permits for new deepwater oil drilling while a commission investigates the causes of the disaster , and ordered 33 deepwater exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico to suspend work while they meet new safety requirements . The move is a setback to offshore exploration and a potential blow to Obama 's efforts to rejig U.S. energy policy . The political fallout from the spill also claimed its highest-profile victim as the head of the government agency that oversees offshore oil drilling resigned . All eyes are on the top kill , the pumping of heavy fluid into the well to stop the gusher before sealing it with cement . BP stopped pumping to analyze data , but resumed later Thursday , said BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles . `` We have not yet stopped the flow , so the operation has not yet achieved its objective , '' said Suttles at a briefing . News of progress on plugging the spill , coupled with a nearly 4 percent rise in oil prices , lifted shares of the companies most closely tied to the spill . BP shares gained nearly 6 percent in London trading . Nervous investors have wiped about a quarter , or $ 50 billion , off the energy giant 's market value since April . Millions of gallons of oil have poured into the Gulf since an April 20 blast on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and triggered the spill , soiling 100 miles of coastline , threatening some of the country 's richest fisheries and endangering a fragile ecosystem already battered by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . The destruction of both the local economy and a way of life was taking an emotional toll , even on elected officials . Louisiana Congressman Charlie Melancon broke down crying as he spoke to a House subcommittee meeting in Washington . Locals who saw President George W. Bush 's administration fumble in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were not impressed by Obama 's pledges on Thursday . `` They ought to get the hell out of the way , '' said Bill Butler , who owns the Venice Marina , a hub for the now paralyzed sport fishing industry . `` They ca n't even run the country . Just give us the equipment and get out of the way . The people of south Louisiana know what to do . '' At the White House , Obama repeatedly defended his administration against mounting criticism from Gulf Coast residents that it was too slow to respond to the spill and too dependent on BP for solutions . The spill could turn into a major political liability for Obama ahead of November elections widely expected to erode his Democratic Party 's control of the U.S. Congress . `` Those who think that we were either slow on our response or lacked urgency do n't know the facts , '' said Obama . `` This has been our highest priority since this crisis occurred , '' he said . Obama said federal authorities had been in charge of the response to the disaster since day one , but had been forced to rely on BP 's superior underwater technology . He also announced that planned exploration off the coast of Alaska would be suspended pending the presidential commission 's review , while pending or proposed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia would also be scrapped . Earlier , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the head of the Minerals Management Service , Liz Birnbaum , had resigned . Many U.S. lawmakers and environmental groups have blamed the federal agency for lax regulation of offshore drilling rigs and production platforms . The scale of the Gulf of Mexico spill -- already large -- expanded hugely with new government figures on Thursday that put the flow rate from the ruptured well at as much as four or five times BP 's estimate of 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- a day . U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said various government teams examining the oil spill estimated the flow ranges from 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million liters -RRB- to 25,000 barrels -LRB- 1.05 million gallons\\/3 .97 million liters -RRB- per day . The team 's best estimate is 12,000-19 ,000 barrels per day , though one of three measurement methods the team used returned a high-end rate of 25,000 barrels per day , said McNutt . BP declined immediate comment on the estimates . In the previous worst U.S. oil spill , in March 1989 , the tanker Exxon Valdez hit an undersea reef in Prince William Sound , Alaska , spilling nearly 260,000 barrels -LRB- 10.92 million gallons\\/41 .34 million liters -RRB- of oil into the sea . `` It 's as if two Exxon Valdez tankers have already run aground and more are on the way if they do n't get this hole plugged , '' said Jeremy Symons of the National Wildlife Federation , adding that the USGS numbers showed BP could not be trusted . Beleaguered Louisiana did get a break on Thursday . The Coast Guard gave the go-ahead for part of a proposed project by state authorities to build up outlying coastal barrier islands to try to stop oil from seeping into fragile marshlands . The state 's Republican governor , Bobby Jindal , has accused BP and the Coast Guard of doing `` too little , too late '' to help defend his state 's shoreline , hardest-hit by the oil spill , and of dithering over the state 's plan to create the barrier island protective rim .

Here are some facts about the impact of the spill : Louisiana , the nearest state to BP 's gushing undersea well 42 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico , has been the most affected by the spill so far . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said this week that more than 100 miles of Louisiana 's 400-mile coast had so far been affected by the spilled oil , including fragile marshlands and wildlife refuges . He and other state and local officials have reported heavy sheets of oil soiling wetlands and seeping into marine and bird nurseries , leaving a thick stain of sticky crude on the Roseau cane that binds the marshes together . Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , said he saw dying cane and `` no life '' in parts of the Pass-a-Loutre wildlife refuge . `` Oil debris , '' in the form of tar balls and surface `` sheen , '' has also been reported coming ashore in outlying parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama . In the week of May 17 , Coast Guard officials found tar balls on some beaches in the Florida Keys , raising fears that a so-called Loop Current that runs from the Gulf of Mexico through the Florida Straits may have already brought oil from the spill far to the southeast . But laboratory tests subsequently showed the tar balls were not from the BP oil spill , the Coast Guard said . The U.S. government has declared a `` fishery disaster '' in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama due to the oil spill . This makes them eligible for federal funds to offset the current and future impact on fisherman and their communities of the oil pollution in their fishing grounds . Louisiana 's $ 2.4 billion seafood industry supplies up to 40 percent of U.S. seafood and employs over 27,000 people . The state is the second-biggest U.S. seafood harvester , after Alaska , and the top provider of shrimp , oysters , crab and crawfish . NOAA on Friday extended the area closed to fishing in the Gulf as a result of the spill to 25 percent of Gulf U.S. federal waters , an area covering 60,683 square miles -LRB- 157,169 square km -RRB- , up from 20 percent previously . It says it is taking this step as a precautionary measure to ensure seafood from the Gulf remains safe for consumers . NOAA points out that approximately 75 percent of Gulf federal waters are still available for fishing . But the ban affects hundreds of thousands of commercial and recreational fishermen , hitting the livelihoods of shrimpers , oystercatchers and charter boat operators . Oil , some of it in thick sheets , but also in the form of sheen and tar balls , has already come ashore in Louisiana wildlife reserves like the Breton National Wildlife Refuge on the offshore Breton and Chandeleur Islands , and the Pass-a-Loutre refuge farther to the south . Wildlife officials have reported more than 300 sea birds , nearly 200 turtles and 19 dolphins have been found dead along the Gulf Coast during the first five weeks after spill . But they stress that only a relatively low number of these had signs of external oiling , so they may not all be related to the spill . The 316 dead birds collected along the shores of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida -- plus 10 others that died or were euthanized at wildlife rehabilitation centers after they were captured alive -- far outnumber the 31 surviving birds found oiled over that period . Journalists and scientists have also reported seeing at least one shark , and other creatures like eels and turtles , swimming through surface oil . Wildlife officials say they expect more marine creatures , birds and mammals will be affected as more of the oil comes ashore . Tourism operators in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- from hotel owners to restaurateurs and boat charterers -- have reported cancellations as a result of the spill , although some are picking up other business from journalists , officials and cleanup workers who have flocked to the Gulf Coast . Amidst a scare involving tar balls found on Florida Keys beaches -- later declared not to have come from the BP oil spill -- Florida 's $ 60-billion-a-year tourism industry is also losing millions as a result of the incident , a top state tourism marketing official said earlier this month . Of all the threatened states , Florida has the most to lose . Tourism is its economic lifeblood , its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors a year , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million Floridians . Officials say even the threat of pollution that could come from the spill is enough to make a significant `` dent '' in the tourism industries of Florida and other Gulf states . Major shipping channels and ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast remain open , although some industry sources have reported possible delays caused by the oil slick . NOAA said on Friday it had begun work to survey a new ship anchorage site at the mouth of the Mississippi River for ships to undergo inspection and oil decontamination before entering ports . U.S. authorities are anxious to keep Gulf shipping operating to maintain vital U.S. exports and imports . NOAA says Lower Mississippi River ports export over 50 million metric tons of corn , soybeans and wheat each year , more than 55 percent of all U.S. grains inspected for shipment . -LRB- Reporting by Matthew Bigg , Steve Gorman and Pascal Fletcher , editing by Pascal Fletcher and Todd Eastham -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "565", "dct": "2010-05-28", "dates": ["2010-05-28", "2010-05-28", "2009-01-01", "2010-05-28", "1959-01-01", "2010-01-01"], "text": "\\* Cuban coast a major breeding ground for marine species \\* Concern that Gulf current could carry oil to Cuba \\* Cuba open to cooperation with U.S. against spill HAVANA , May 28 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Red flags went up on beaches in western Cuban this week , closing them briefly to swimmers amid rumors that the BP oil spill in the U.S. part of the Gulf of Mexico was forcing sharks into Cuban waters . The government , through state-run press , quickly denounced the rumors as false and the beaches were reopened , but the incident reflected fears that the massive spill will reach Cuba and wreak havoc on an island still relatively untouched by modernity 's environmental ills . `` Cuba , like all the countries in this area , is worried about the situation in the Gulf , '' said Osmani Borrego Fernandez , a director at the Guanahacabibes National Park at Cuba 's western tip . So far , he said , there has been no evidence of the oil , but `` we are alert . '' A trip along Cuba 's coastline is like a trip back in time where vast stretches of palm-fringed beaches sit undeveloped and sea life abounds in the crystalline waters . While rampant development and overfishing have damaged coastlines and depleted seas around the world , communist-led Cuba has been largely preserved by its slow economic pace . As a result , scientists and environmentalists view Cuban waters as a place where they can see how the world 's oceans were decades ago . `` Many areas along the coast , and thousands of small keys , are in rural areas or are remote and have simply been left alone , '' said Dan Whittle , senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund . `` Ernest Hemingway set up a fish camp on Cayo Paraiso -LRB- about 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- west of Havana -RRB- in the 1940s and the area has not really changed since then . If he were still alive , he 'd still recognize it today , '' he said of the U.S. writer who lived in Cuba for two decades . Cuba 's northwest coast is considered most in danger from the oil . It is there that coral reefs , seagrass beds and mangroves provide major breeding grounds for many fish and sea creatures , including endangered migratory species like sea turtles , sharks and manatees , Whittle said . All that is at stake if the BP oil finds its way to Cuba . It could also damage Cuba 's tourism industry , which is centered on beaches and to a lesser degree eco-tourism . Tourism brought in more than $ 2 billion to Cuba last year , or about 20 percent of Cuban 's foreign exchange income . The good news for Cuba is that the spill is still centered about 300 miles -LRB- 483 km -RRB- northwest of the island and BP may finally be gaining control over the massive leak . Officials for the oil giant said on Friday their so-called `` top kill '' solution of plugging the gusher by pumping in `` drilling mud '' was showing signs of success . But even if that happens soon , Cuban officials are concerned that the oil already in the water could be swept south by gulf currents . Cuba is separated from the Florida Keys by just 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- of water and despite their disparate political histories , the United States and Cuba are inextricably linked ecologically . Another rumor that supposedly contributed to the Cuban beach closures this week was that lionfish , which have venomous spikes and have invaded Cuban waters in recent years from Florida , were poisoning swimmers . The government said that rumor also was false . The United States and Cuba have been at odds since Fidel Castro took power in a 1959 revolution , but they held talks last week about the oil slick , officials said . Cuba expert Wayne Smith at the Center for International Policy think tank in Washington said he met with Cuban authorities this week in Havana and that they are `` fully open '' to cooperation with the Americans to stop the oil . Standing in the way is the longstanding U.S. trade embargo against Cuba , which prevents the use of much U.S. technology in Cuba . At a conference this week in Washington , oil experts and environmentalists said it was time to allow cooperation with Cuba in oil safety practices . `` We are not talking about a transfer of technology . All we are asking is that , if there is an accident , the Cubans can pick up the phone and call American experts who can bring resources within 24 hours , '' said oil expert Jorge Pinon . The issue is becoming a bigger one as Spanish oil giant Repsol -LRB- REP. MC -RRB- REP. N prepares to drill for oil off Cuba 's ecologically rich northwest coast perhaps later this year . It has contracted for use of an Italian-owned drilling rig now being completed in China . While the spill is a disaster , it might have one positive result , Smith said . `` It actually could help improve -LRB- U.S.-Cuba -RRB- relations if we cooperate in the right way and we have the right attitude , '' he said .

I have spoken to several fishing guides over the past couple of days and they all complain about BP -- held squarely responsible for the mess -- the situation , and the numerous clients who keep canceling their trips . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Friday that it was extending the closed fishing area to about 25 percent of the Gulf from around 19 percent before , dealing a further blow to both commercial fishermen and sport angling guides . But what surprises me as someone who just arrived here a couple of days ago is the trickle of boats still leaving the Venice Marina with angling clients . They seem to be going either close inshore or very far because of the closures . Several of the guides I spoke to said there were still inshore areas open to fishing though one said , `` We have to work harder for the fish because the good areas we normally go to are closed .

Guide Jeff Fuscia , while loading his 24-foot -LRB- 7-1\\/2 meter -RRB- boat onto a trailer , told me on Friday his clients that morning had taken their limit of five redfish each and had released several more .

The Natural Resources Defense Council , VoteVets.org , Americans United for Change and American Family Voices are mounting separate TV campaigns during Congress ' weeklong Memorial Day recess to press Senate Democrats and Republicans to get behind the climate bill introduced this month by Democrat John Kerry and independent Joseph Lieberman . Ads will appear on national cable TV and local TV broadcasts in a dozen states including Louisiana , Florida , North Carolina , Kentucky , Illinois , New Jersey , Vermont , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Maine and Wisconsin . Sponsors said the campaigns , also timed to occur at the start of the U.S. summer driving season , marked the first time advocacy groups cited the oil spill in national advertising . The Gulf of Mexico leak has surpassed the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Advocates are worried that action on the climate bill , a major piece of legislation to battle global warming , could be delayed for months as Congress approaches the November elections . `` People are extremely concerned about the oil spill . That shifts the political dynamics around the legislation . They are connected , '' said Michael Oko , a spokesman for the NRDC 's lobbying arm . One aim is to prompt Senate Democrats to move toward consolidating disparate climate-related bills into a single piece of legislation at a caucus meeting expected on June 10 . The NRDC 's lobby arm is spending $ 200,000 on an ad that calls on the United States to break its addiction to foreign oil and seeks the support of individual lawmakers . The biggest campaign is a $ 1.5 million buy for an ad by VoteVets.org , which represents veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . In the ad , a Louisiana National Guardsman on cleanup duty in the Gulf describes U.S. dependence on oil as a threat to national security and calls for clean American power . The labor-backed groups , Americans United for Change and American Family Voices , are paying $ 400,000 for ads that cite oil industry campaign contributions to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and fellow Republicans David Vitter and Richard Burr as a form of political pollution . BP has funded a TV and radio advertising campaign to assure tourists that U.S. Gulf Coast beaches remain open despite the oil spill off the Louisiana coast that has closed the local fishing trade and sent sticky oil into wetlands . -LRB- Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Peter Cooney -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1700", "dct": "2010-05-29", "dates": ["2010-05-26", "2010-04-20", "2010-05-28", "1989-01-01", "2010-05-31", "2010-05-23"], "text": "`` We have not been able to stop the flow , '' said Doug Suttles , the London-based oil giant 's chief operating officer . `` We have made the decision to move on to the next option , '' he added . That next option is called the lower marine riser package cap , one that captures oil from the well rather than plug it . Suttles said it could take four days or longer to show results . U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Mary Landry , flanking Suttles at a daily briefing , said the news of the top kill failure was disappointing and that the best option for ending the spill was drilling a relief well which BP estimates will take two months . The top kill maneuver started on Wednesday and involved pumping heavy fluids and other material into the well shaft to stifle the flow , then seal it with cement . But it was fraught with risk because it had never been attempted at the depth of the well , a mile beneath the sea . The failure was a further blow to BP 's reputation and bottom line . The company has spent $ 940 million so far to try to plug the leak and clean up the sea and soiled marshlands vital to wildlife and fishing . The news will also put further pressure on U.S. President Barack Obama , who is struggling to persuade Americans that his administration can handle the crisis . The plodding clean-up effort has sickened workers and left Gulf coast residents frustrated and angry . The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers and unleashing an underwater torrent of oil that the government estimated at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 to 798,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million to 3 million liters -RRB- a day . Obama faced criticism that he responded too slowly and assured people in Louisiana during a visit on Friday that they `` will not be left behind '' and that the `` buck stops '' with him . There is not much Obama can do other than apply pressure to BP to get it right and put his best scientists in the room . The government has no deep-sea oil technology of its own . This week , government estimates showed that the Gulf spill surpassed the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaskan waters . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

'' Browner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation , '' `` We are prepared for the worst . '' Louisiana , the nearest state to BP 's gushing undersea well that is 42 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico , has been the most impacted by the spill so far . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said this week that more than 100 miles of Louisiana 's 400-mile coast had so far been impacted by the spilled oil . State officials have reported sheets of oil soiling wetlands and seeping into marine and bird nurseries , leaving a stain of sticky crude on cane that binds the marshes together . Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , saw dying cane and `` no life '' in parts of Pass-a-Loutre wildlife refuge . `` Oil debris '' , in the form of tar balls and surface `` sheen '' , has also been reported coming ashore since the April 20 accident in outlying parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama . In the week of May 17 , Coast Guard officials found tar balls on some beaches in the Florida Keys , raising fears that the so-called Loop Current that runs from the Gulf of Mexico through the Florida Straits may have already brought oil from the spill far to the southeast . But laboratory tests subsequently showed the tar balls were not from the BP spill . The U.S. government has declared a `` fishery disaster '' in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama due to the oil spill . This makes them eligible for federal funds to offset the impact on fisherman and their communities of the oil pollution in their fishing grounds . Louisiana 's $ 2.4 billion seafood industry supplies up to 40 percent of U.S. seafood supply and employs over 27,000 people . The state is the second-biggest U.S. seafood harvester and the top provider of shrimp , oysters , crab and crawfish . NOAA on Friday extended the area closed to fishing in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the spill to 25 percent of Gulf U.S. federal waters , an area covering 60,683 square miles -LRB- 157,168 square km -RRB- , up from 20 percent previously . It is taking this step as a precautionary measure to ensure that seafood from the Gulf will remain safe for consumers . NOAA points out that approximately 75 percent of Gulf federal waters are still available for fishing . But the ban affects hundreds of thousands of commercial and recreational fishermen , hitting the livelihoods of shrimpers , oystercatchers and charter boat operators . Oil , some of it in thick sheets , but also in the form of sheen and tar balls , has already come ashore in Louisiana wildlife reserves like the Breton National Wildlife Refuge in the offshore Breton and Chandeleur Islands , and the Pass-a-Loutre refuge further to the south . Over the 40 days since the spill started , wildlife officials report that 491 birds , 227 turtles and 27 mammals , including dolphins , have been collected dead along the U.S. Gulf Coast , according to an update released on Sunday by the oil response unified command . Officials stress that not all of the deaths were necessarily caused by the BP spill , and that some will have been from natural causes . Of the 491 dead birds collected , only 28 were visibly oiled . A further 66 visibly oiled birds were rescued alive . Journalists and scientists have also reported seeing at least one shark , and other creatures like eels and turtles , swimming through surface oil . Wildlife officials say however they expect more marine creatures , birds and mammals will be affected . Scientists say they are also concerned about the unseen and unknown effects on the marine environment and food chain of underwater `` plumes '' of dispersed oil , some of them several miles -LRB- km -RRB- long , emanating from the deepwater spill site . Tourism operators in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- from hotel owners to restaurateurs and boat charterers -- have reported cancellations as a result of the oil spill , although some are picking up other business from journalists , officials and cleanup workers who have flocked to the Gulf Coast . Amidst a scare involving tar balls found on Florida Keys beaches -- later declared not to have come from the BP oil spill , Florida 's $ 60-billion-a-year tourism industry is also losing millions as a result of the incident , a top state tourism marketing official said earlier this month . Of all the threatened states , Florida has the most to lose . Tourism is its economic lifeblood , its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors a year , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million Floridians . Officials say even the mere threat of oil pollution from the spill is enough to make a significant `` dent '' in the tourism industries of Florida and other Gulf states .

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Friday it had begun work to survey a new ship anchorage site at the mouth of the Mississippi River for ships to undergo inspection and oil decontamination before entering ports .

One congressman called the nearly six-week oil gush in the Gulf of Mexico an `` environmental crime , '' while a Louisiana senator demanded BP invest $ 1 billion immediately to protect the region 's treasured marshlands . The failure on Saturday of a `` top kill '' technique attempted by London-based BP to try to seal its leaking Gulf well has unleashed a surge of anger and frustration that poses a major domestic challenge for President Barack Obama . Obama , who has called the leaking BP well a `` man-made disaster , '' is trying to fend off criticism that his administration acted too slowly in its response to the spill , now known to be the worst in U.S. history . He is in a bind because it appears only BP can stop the leak , although he has made clear the government is in charge . But critics say he has not directed enough resources to the unfolding disaster and he has been present enough . The White House said on Sunday that the government will triple clean-up resources in areas affected by the spill , while the administration 's top energy and environment officials head back to the Gulf this week following Obama 's second visit on Friday . `` This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country , '' top White House energy adviser Carol Browner told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' BP , its reputation and market value already battered by the catastrophic spill , and the entire U.S. oil industry face more probing questions about why safety backups did not accompany their pursuit of oil in ever deeper offshore waters . `` I think without question if the word criminal should be used in terms of an environmental crime against our country , that what 's going on in the Gulf of Mexico is going to qualify , '' U.S. Representative Ed Markey told CBS ' `` Face the Nation . '' Department of Justice officials are part of an ongoing federal investigation into the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the spill , and the Obama administration has not ruled out the possibility of a criminal prosecution . In Louisiana , which has borne the brunt of the oil spill impact so far , local authorities demanded that BP and the federal government rush a plan to create a sand barrier to the oil by dredging and building up outlying sandbanks and islets . `` I 'm devastated ... We are dying a slow death , every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh , a piece of Louisiana is gone forever , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , where the oil has clogged wetlands . `` Even the government seems powerless and all the experts . If these people ca n't stop it , then who in the name of God can ? '' Father Gerry , a priest at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Port Sulphur , Louisiana , said , his voice heavy with emotion . ` OIL COMING UP UNTIL AUGUST ' After giving up on Saturday an attempt to pump heavy fluids and blocking materials into the leaking well to `` kill '' it , BP is pursuing another option from its undersea toolbox . But BP warns that the new procedure , which will try to fit a containment cap over the leaking well , could take between four and seven days . Even then success is not guaranteed because it has never been attempted before at the depth -- a mile down -- where the oil is leaking . BP Managing Director Robert Dudley told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' the company would know by the end of the week whether the new containment effort worked . The next BP step would involve undersea robots using diamond-rimmed saws to cut off a pipe over the well to put in place a containment device that would try to siphon off most of the leaking oil and gas up to a tanker ship on the surface . Dudley said he did not think BP CEO Tony Hayward , who has faced heavy criticism , should be forced to resign . A surer solution to the leak , a relief well already being drilled , is not expected to be finished until early August . This means crude oil continues to spew out daily , feeding a huge , fragmented slick that has already polluted marshlands teeming with wildlife and rich fisheries in Louisiana . `` There could be oil coming up until August . '' Browner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation , '' `` We are prepared for the worst . '' Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu called on BP to immediately invest $ 1 billion to protect marshes , wetlands and estuaries across the region . `` While we may not be able to plug the leaking well right away , there is nothing that should stop us from getting help to the Gulf Coast immediately , '' she said . Gulf residents fear the spilled oil could be whipped further inshore by what promises to be the most active Atlantic storm season since 2005 , the year of Hurricane Katrina . That deadly storm proved a political disaster for President George W. Bush , who was accused of complacency in handling it , and Obama is fighting to prevent the Gulf spill from becoming his own `` Katrina '' ahead of the November congressional elections . Louisianans still recovering from Katrina 's devastation were frustrated by the oil spill response . `` It 's been a screw-up from day one . Nothing was at the ready and no one was in a position to respond , '' said Claude Marquette , a retired physician , 68 , speaking as he sat with his wife in his boat . BP 's Hayward had predicted that despite risks , the `` top kill '' had a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . He said he did not know why it failed to stop the gusher . The misstep is likely to drive his credibility lower , along with his company 's market value , which has dropped by 25 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers , and triggering the spill . The government estimated last week that 12,000 to 19,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 to 798,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million to 3 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the well . At that rate , the government now knows that the Gulf disaster has surpassed the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaskan waters . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . -LRB- As I am trying to communicate to BP\\/the US to see if it is legitimate -RRB- : 1 . Clear debris , rock , mud , etc from gushing pipe . Strong vice grips as wide as the pipe diameter squeeze the pipe shut as absolutely as much as possible . Solder and Meld the Pipe Shut , from one end of the crease to the other , and Reinforce the Closure . Do for all open pipes . Use it if it will work . I can not fathom why they have not just tried the procedure of getting tankers on the way and use the method they have mentioned to collect as much as possible . That done sooner seems it would have sharply reduced the spill magnitude . A small-yield nuke would melt a couple hundred feet of basalt on top of that tiny hole and compress a large portion of the sea bed below that as well . Its just a hole in the ground . Melt it shut with a nuke . This discussion is now closed . We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication .

Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Some have mentioned that the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico may increase in size , what if a tipping point is reached and the entire Gulf of Mexico flashes into a dead zone ? Let me push this danger to it 's possible extremes and see what the worst case scenario may become . All life in the Gulf of Mexico dies including algae and plankton . Algae\\/plankton symbiotic relationship creates 80 % of all oxygen on Earth . Couple this with vapors rising from the chemical soup mixture that is being created from the petro chemical spill as well as the dispersant interactions with the oil and air breathing creatures -LRB- humans -RRB- could start dying in large numbers in nearby land areas . Just how big this spill continues to grow would effect how far toxic vapors could spread , but again let 's go worst case ; Land areas near Gulf including parts of Mexico , Texas , Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi , Florida , and Cuba may need to be evacuated . In the case of Florida with prevailing winds entire state may become effected . Remember people are already being sickened by the fumes . I have no doubt now that there will be fatalities amongst those people with lung disease eventually , even in a best case scenario if the oil leak stopped today . Enough oil has already contaminated the Gulf waters , `` greatest environmental disaster in US history '' is how some are now reporting this event . Beyond environmental considerations are financial considerations . Many retirement funds are heavily invested in BP worldwide , and the value of BP has certainly fallen on stock exchanges , hence retirements worldwide will shortly have less returns than expected by the retired , of course all other investors worldwide will be effected as well , just that many investment funds do not inform the retired where their investments are made . Much has been made of the loss of revenue by local fishermen , tourism , restaurants , and seafood distributors on down the line . But this may all be just the start of financial dominoes that likely will effect everyone on Earth eventually . In the hard economic times faced by the worldwide economy this could be far more than the proverbial last straw , there are too many people on Earth to supply with food than greatly reduced food sources will be able to feed . Under such conditions the danger of worldwide war is a factor that can not go unconsidered , humans are not always logical creatures , and fear of starvation is motivation enough for a real worst case scenario , ie ; Human Extinction ! I know I am pushing this to horrible extremes , but some if not all is possible and needs consideration especially if the flow is not stopped very soon . There have also been revelations that this chemical soup may soon be reaching the Gulf Stream and that may take dangerous chemicals up the entire eastern coast of North America . From there the ocean currents will carry portions of this soup to Europe and who knows how far beyond . We are realizing that we have a worldwide economy , and so too the environment of the entire Earth is eventually interconnected . How many people out of desperation to survive will allow toxin contaminated materials and foods to be shipped to locations worldwide ? Deaths are inevitable even if never tracked back to the cause . Why am I pushing all these dangers to the extremes ? Not for fear mongering ! Quite the opposite actually , `` To be forewarned is to be forearmed '' Something needs to be done very soon to stop this oil flow . This is an EMERGENCY ! Extreme action is warranted ! Every nation on Earth should be concerned . Something can be done ! This flow can be stopped somehow , there are literally thousands of concepts out there to deal with this disaster , yet far too long a period of time is being spent between attempts . If a hundred tons of concrete was dumped on the site that would likely stop the flow , but if it took a million tons of concrete it would still be needed to be done some way or another ! Perhaps even pumping volcano ash -LRB- which we seem to have in abundance at moment -RRB- into the well would seal it forever . Much is being made of drilling the side shafts near the well to take off some of the pressure and slow the flow , but these side shafts can also be used to pump concrete or V ash into area and seal off the leak permanently . To use these shafts only as a siphon to slow the flow makes it look like we are more concerned with getting the oil rather than stopping the flow from the leak . We need to stop this oil flow very soon ! I have laid out some of the possible worst case scenarios , but I could be wrong about any of these points , however there are bound to be other worst case possibilities that I am not considering . Enough with this real life horror show , we gotta stop the flow ! If a war broke out would we wait for a private company to fight the war because they somehow may have caused the conflict ? It 's become abundantly clear what is going on with the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Here are some steps you can take on your own to recover your property losses . Take pictures of everything and document everything . Most of your state officials can go on the Internet and find information about the Migratory Bird Treaty and the Clean Water Act . The residents with property loss can Google the Bouchard B-120 oil spill in Buzzards Bay , Massachusetts . Be sure to review the current class action litigation going on even today over the 2003 oil spill . The oil spills have to stop ! On April 27 , 2003 , eight years ago the Bouchard Barge B-120 hit an obstacle in Buzzards Bay , Massachusetts creating a 12-foot rupture in its hull and discharging an estimated 100,000 gallons of No. 6 oil . Remember everyone must ask how likely are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -LRB- PAHs -RRB- in crude oil to cause cancer ? This discussion is now closed .

Government and BP officials are warning that the blown-out deepwater well feeding the catastrophic spill may not be shut off until August as the company begins preparations on a new but uncertain attempt to contain the leaking crude . On Tuesday , President Barack Obama will hold his first meeting with co-chairs of an oil spill commission he tapped to probe the worst oil spill in U.S. history and make policy recommendations about U.S. offshore oil drilling . The commission will be similar to those that looked into the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 . Also on Tuesday , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will meet with federal prosecutors and state attorneys general in New Orleans . It will be Holder 's first trip to survey the damage before what legal experts believe will be a criminal investigation into the disaster . U.S. officials are treating the disaster , in its 42nd day on Monday , as the country 's biggest environmental catastrophe . Although Louisiana 's wetlands and fishing grounds have been the worst hit so far by the spill , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said moderate southerly and southwesterly winds this week may start moving oil closer to the Mississippi and Alabama coasts . `` Model results indicate that oil may move north to threaten the barrier islands off Mississippi and Alabama later in the forecast period , '' NOAA said in its 72-hour prediction on the expected trajectory of the huge oil slick . Mississippi and Alabama have escaped lightly so far , with only scattered tar balls and oil debris reaching its coasts . But the NOAA forecast was a sober reminder that oil from the unchecked spill , broken up and carried by winds and ocean currents , could threaten a vast area of the U.S. Gulf Coast , including tourism mecca Florida , as well as Cuba and Mexico . Following the failure this weekend of BP 's attempt to plug the spewing mile-deep well , public anger over the spill and how it occurred is growing , as tens of thousands of Gulf Coast residents face a pollution impact on their livelihoods . A group calling itself Seize BP , which has already staged anti-BP protests , said on Monday it would organize demonstrations in more than 50 U.S. cities from Thursday to Saturday to protest the damage from the leaking oil . The group demands that BP 's assets be immediately seized and held in trust to pay compensation for the spill triggered by the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig . `` The greatest environmental disaster with no end in sight ! Millions of gallons of oil gushing for months -LRB- and possibly years -RRB- to come . Creatures dying , '' Seize BP said in a statement . The public anger and frustration over the spill poses a major domestic challenge for Obama , who has been forced to admit publicly that the U.S. government and military do not have the technology to plug the leaking well and must leave this to BP and its private industry partners . Obama , who made his second visit to the Gulf disaster zone on Friday , is sending three of his top energy and environmental officials back there this week . He is trying to fend off criticism that his administration acted too slowly in its response to the spill . The crisis could swell into a political liability for the Democratic president as his administration and party , bloodied by bruising healthcare and economic policy debates , head toward congressional elections in November . Louisiana 's commercial and recreational fishing industry already has been dealt a blow by the spill . Fishing boats bobbed idle on Monday at the Venice Marina in Louisiana , which would normally be a hive of activity during the long Memorial Day weekend . `` Just take a look around , it 's quiet , '' marina owner Bill Butler said as he sat wistfully looking at the idle boats . As a health precaution , U.S. authorities have closed all fishing in 25 percent of Gulf of Mexico U.S. federal waters . The Gulf Coast is one of America 's richest ecosystems and a vital breeding ground for a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry . ULTIMATE HOPES IN RELIEF WELL BP executives say the company will try several immediate options to try to control the leak , including the planned deployment of a containment cap in the next few days , but the ultimate solution may only lie in the drilling of a relief well that is expected to be completed in August . The drilling of two relief wells , which began in May , is an expensive but more reliable way to intercept and cap the leaking well . The Gulf spill has surpassed the Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska in 1989 as the worst U.S. oil spill , with an estimated 12,000 to 19,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 to 798,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million to 3 million liters -RRB- leaking per day . BP is now preparing a containment cap to place on top of a lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- , a piece of equipment that sits atop the failed well blowout preventer on the seabed . Remote vehicles have begun cutting away pipes atop the blowout preventer to allow a tight fit with the cap , and will saw through the main riser pipe in `` next day or two , '' a BP spokesman said on Monday . If the containment operation works -- and BP expects to know later this week -- then at least some of the leaking oil could be piped to the surface . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The technology exists , one company that has the technology is in Louisiana . The company specializes in cutting off sub-sea pile caps but the equipment can easily be converted to crimp pipe . I talked to the owner Leon Trudeau three weeks ago . He had converted his machines to crimp pipe and had completed a number of tests with success . He was prepared to put his equipment on a barge and sent to the site but was not getting any response from BP or their subcontractors . At first I thought that BP may have another solution and they did not want to expose themselves to addition risk but this has gone on long enough . The machines can be reconfigured to operate horizontally or vertically . Position the machine around the pipe and crimp it . Leave the machine on the pipe with hydraulic cylinders pressurized . Just because a BP executive ordered that seawater be injected into the well instead of drilling mud , which led to the blowout , Does not mean that BP has any liability . BP has the bigger lawyers , so they are always right . The whole BP Oil Spill story has been one long list of failures , lies and ineptitude by all the major stakeholders involved . The Obama administration , BP and the Oil Regulator have all been guilty of incompetence , procrastination , finger pointing and cover-ups . All of BP s efforts have come to naught while dealing with the Oil Spill . The much heralded top kill operation which was supposed to have a high probability of success joins the other efforts in the failure list . BP had given a 60-70 % success to the top kill effort despite never having tested this kind of technique at such a depth . This discussion is now closed .

I have two facilities and they have ice machines and cold storage , '' she said in her cramped roadside office , seated beneath pictures of Jesus and the Virgin Mary . As of Sunday , BP said 26,000 claims had been filed by commercial fishermen , angling guides and others who say they have lost income because of the six-week-old spill , which the White House says is probably the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history . Of those claims , 11,650 had been paid for a total of $ 35 million . Analysts say the British-based company , whose reputation and market value have been battered by the spill , faces billions of dollars in cleanup costs and damages claims . As local fishermen rue the season that got away , BP says it is ready to pay more in their individual claims , but for now it is focused on what it calls `` hardship payments '' to help mitigate immediate loss of income . `` If they need more they can come back to us . These immediate hardship claims do not preclude the longer-term claims , '' said BP spokesman David Nicholas . But anger over the process is mounting on several fronts in steamy bayou villages where shrimp boats sit idle and sports fishing guides while their extra time away in bars . The anger focuses first on the amounts paid out so far , which many locals say is hardly enough to pay bills and make ends meet . Several locals who spoke to Reuters had received $ 5,000 , but others said they had been given less . `` My understanding is that if you are a captain\\/guide and own a boat , you get $ 5,000 , but if you are just a captain or just own a boat you get $ 2,500 , '' said sport angling guide Alec Griffin , who specializes in fly fishing . `` I own the boat but it 's still registered in the name of my friend who I bought it from , so I just got $ 2,500 . It just helps to ease the sting from canceled trips , '' he said . Many locals are also upset that they have to present tax documentation and paperwork to show their income over the previous three years as a way to assess their losses in 2010 . The recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the economic recession and record-high fuel prices mean that the past few years have been lean ones for many . Others have also only been working in their current occupations for a year , making it difficult to estimate income loss for this season . Many were banking on this year as the `` big one '' as the economy recovers from recession . And for a number of reasons -- the lack of serious storms last year , the amount of winter rainfall -- fishing conditions this year looked superb . `` It would have been a good summer ; the marsh was in good shape , there was lots of clean water , '' said Griffin . In the New Orleans suburb of Belle Chasse , oysterman Kuzma Tesvich said he had had high hopes for 2010 . `` Our crop was good . We expected a good season and a good year but after all this we do n't know what 's going to happen to our oysters out there in the water , '' he said . He said he had received his $ 5,000 from BP but said he was making $ 2,000 a day before the spill closed down his 1,500-acre -LRB- 600-hectare -RRB- oyster operation . BP has said it is aware that recent years ' earnings are below what some people could reasonably have expected to make this year . Last week , it said it would appoint an independent mediator to settle any disputes over claims that arise . It has also said it will be flexible with people who do n't have all of their paperwork in order . Hundreds of Gulf Coast fishermen are also being paid by BP to help with its oil spill containment operations , which also clearly helps bridge some of the lost earnings gap . But the notion of handouts is alien to the resilient people here , many of whom have a strong sense of independence . `` These people are self-employed , they are not used to being reduced to handouts and to looking for help , '' said Father Gerry , the Catholic priest in the bayou town of Port Sulphur . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . I do n't think the damage will be confined to the Gulf area as this article seems to indicate . The oil spill is spreading not only on the surface but also deep in the ocean , and fish in any depth of the ocean would wallow the oil droplet and many would swim to faraway places or would be eaten by other fish which end up at faraway places . Eventually the fishery industry of the entire lower 48 states would be damaged . I do n't know if it is safe to eat seafood in Boston or NYC a couple of years down the road . Any expert opinions on this ? URGENT_GET THIS MESSAGE TO OBAMA : get ALL the major oil companies , Shell , Exxon , etc , all the data they need to work on stopping the oil leak . Whoever stops it first then they give BP the bill . Whoever can clean it up the quickest , BP gets their bill too . Everyone post and pass this message on . Finger point AFTER leak stopped and cleanup in progress . Someone at Lloyds of London insurance Company sold BP , policies covering just such an oil spill as is happening now , knowing full well that BP did not know how to fix problems like this . Lloyds needs to find out who did the selling as they are responsible for massive claims that LLOYDS will have to pay . Probably the same people that sold BP shares short a few months ago and the same people that saw to it the rig got blown up . This discussion is now closed .

U.S. government and BP officials are warning that the blown-out deepwater well feeding the catastrophic spill may not be shut off until August as the company begins preparations on a new but uncertain attempt to contain the leaking crude . The London Stock Exchange and Wall Street were closed for holidays on Monday , but BP shares traded in Frankfurt sank 7 percent to close at around 5.40 euros -LRB- $ 6.62 -RRB- on the news of the company 's weekend failure to halt the oil leak . BP 's stock has lost nearly a quarter of its value since the oil spill started six weeks ago , wiping nearly 29 billion pounds -LRB- $ 42 billion -RRB- off BP 's market value , according to Reuters data . The disaster , in its 42nd day on Monday , is already the largest oil spill in U.S. history and officials are treating it it as the country 's biggest environmental catastrophe . Although Louisiana 's wetlands and fishing grounds have been the worst hit so far by the spill , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said moderate southerly and southwesterly winds this week may start moving oil closer to the Mississippi Delta . `` Model results indicate that oil may move north to threaten the barrier islands off Mississippi and Alabama later in the forecast period , '' NOAA said in its 72-hour prediction on the expected trajectory of the huge oil slick . Mississippi and Alabama have escaped lightly so far , with only scattered tar balls and `` oil debris '' reaching its coasts . But the NOAA forecast was a sober reminder that oil from the unchecked spill , broken up and carried by winds and ocean currents , could threaten a vast area of the U.S. Gulf Coast , including tourism mecca Florida , as well as Cuba and Mexico . Following the failure this weekend of BP 's attempt to plug the leaking mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- - deep well , public anger over the spill and how it occurred is growing , as tens of thousands of Gulf Coast residents face a pollution impact on their livelihoods . A group calling itself Seize BP , which has already staged anti-BP protests , said on Monday it would organize demonstrations in more than 50 U.S. cities from Thursday to Saturday to protest the damage from the leaking oil . The group demands that BP 's assets be immediately seized and held in trust to pay compensation for the spill triggered by the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig . `` The greatest environmental disaster with no end in sight ! Millions of gallons of oil gushing for months -LRB- and possibly years -RRB- to come . A pristine environment destroyed for generations . A mega-corporation that has lied and continues to lie , and a government that refuses to protect the people , '' Seize BP said in a statement . The public anger and frustration over the spill poses a major domestic challenge for President Barack Obama , who has been forced to admit publicly that the U.S. government and military do not have the technology to plug the leaking well and must leave this to BP and its private industry partners . Obama , who made his second visit to the Gulf disaster zone on Friday , is sending three of his top energy and environmental officials back there this week . He is trying to fend off criticism that his administration acted too slowly in its response to the spill , the worst in U.S. history . The crisis could swell into a political liability for the Democratic president as his administration and party , bloodied by bruising healthcare and economic policy debates , head towards key mid-term Congressional elections in November . Louisiana 's commercial and recreational fishing industry has already been dealt a hammer blow by the spill . Fishing boats bobbed idle on Monday at the Venice Marina in Louisiana , which would normally be a hive of activity during the long Memorial Day weekend . `` Just take a look around , it 's quiet ... normally it would be ` balls to the walls ' here , '' said marina owner Bill Butler , as he sat wistfully looking at the idle boats .

If the containment operation works -- and BP expects to know later this week -- then at least some of the leaking oil could be piped to the surface . But even President Obama 's administration seems to be looking toward August and the relief well solution . `` There could be oil coming up until August , '' top White House energy adviser Carol Browner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation '' on Sunday . `` We are prepared for the worst .

A mile below the ocean surface , BP began a new strategy to tackle the six-week-old drama , using underwater robots to cut away extraneous pipes before trying to contain the leaking oil and channel it to a ship on the surface . After meeting co-chairs of a commission that will investigate the accident , Obama raised the prospect of criminal prosecutions . `` If our laws were broken leading to this death and destruction , my solemn pledge is that we will bring those responsible to justice on behalf of the victims of this catastrophe and the people of the Gulf region , '' Obama said . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in New Orleans that the U.S. government has launched a criminal probe and that federal agencies , including the FBI , are participating . `` We will not rest until justice is done , '' Holder told reporters . The Justice Department will look for violations of the Clean Water Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which can be used to hold violators liable for cleanup costs and reimbursement for government efforts . The oil giant 's shares in London closed down 13 percent on Tuesday , at 430 pence , after falling by as much as 17 percent . In New York , BP 's American Depositary Receipts lost nearly 15 percent to close at $ 36.52 . The shares were hit hard by weekend news that its latest attempt to plug its blown-out seabed well had not worked , sparking fears oil could leak into the Gulf until August . BP shares have lost more than a third of their value , or about 46 billion pounds -LRB- $ 67 billion -RRB- , since the leak started . The cost of dealing with the crisis now totals $ 990 million , and is rising . Shares of other companies with stakes in the well were also down between 10 and 19 percent , including Anadarko , Transocean , Cameron and Halliburton . At the same time , the cost of protecting the debt of what was once Britain 's biggest company against default rose sharply . The five-year BP credit default swap widened by 71 basis points to 173 basis points , CDS monitor Markit said . The cost to protect Anadarko , Transocean and Halliburton debt also soared . Analysts were increasingly gloomy about BP as an investment , with one issuing a sell order and saying he thinks the company will be broken by the crisis . A poll by CNBC , a Wall Street news channel watched by many savvy U.S. investors , said that 63 percent of those surveyed say BP will be fine in a year , while 25 percent believe the company will be under bankruptcy protection and 12 percent think BP would go under . But the White House said BP had the resources to cover the financial costs of the disaster . `` You 've got a company with the type of market capitalization that can and will fully pay for the damage caused by the disaster they are responsible for , '' spokesman Robert Gibbs said when asked at a briefing if the Obama administration was concerned the spill could ruin BP financially . In the next attempt to contain the leak , robotic equipment will use giant shears and a diamond saw to cut a pipe 35 feet above the wellhead that will allow BP to sit a dome on top of it and funnel oil to a tanker on the surface . `` We are intent on minimizing the flow of the oil into the Gulf and we 've begun a series of operations to ensure just that , '' BP managing director Bob Dudley told CNN . It could take up to 72 hours to get the containment device operational , said Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup . If this attempt fails , it is possible that up to 19,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 800,000 gallons\\/3 million liters -RRB- a day will leak into the Gulf until relief wells , due in August , are completed . The leak is a financial and public relations nightmare for BP and its problems are just beginning . Holder , the U.S. attorney general , and top Justice Department officials met state and federal prosecutors from Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi and afterward announced that the criminal probe was under way . `` We have begun both a criminal as well as a civil investigation as is our obligation under the law , '' Holder told reporters . `` Our environmental laws are very clear . '' OBAMA VOWS LAWS , REGULATION OVERHAUL Obama , who is fighting accusations that he has not reacted swiftly enough to a disaster that threatens Louisiana 's multibillion-dollar seafood industry , sat down with the heads of a commission looking into the leak -- former Senator Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly . `` If the laws on our books are insufficient to prevent such a spill , the laws must change . If oversight was inadequate to enforce these laws , oversight has to be reformed , '' Obama said . The commission will be similar to those that examined two previous unprecedented U.S. catastrophes -- the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 . The fate of BP 's shares weighed on investors but was of little concern to residents of Louisiana 's coast , who have suffered crippling losses because of the closure of some Gulf waters to fishing . `` I really do n't care much about it , '' Kimberly Mertz , who works at a marina in rural Venice , Louisiana , said of the share price . `` We want to get everything cleaned up . '' The slick has spread over 100 miles of Louisiana 's coast , but Mississippi and Alabama have escaped so far with only scattered tar balls and oil debris reaching their coasts . National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said moderate southerly and southwesterly winds this week may start moving oil closer to the Mississippi and Alabama coasts . The forecast was a reminder that oil from the unchecked spill , broken up and carried by winds and ocean currents , could threaten tourist attraction Florida , and Cuba and Mexico . Commercial boats recruited to the oil spill response were being deployed to increase monitoring of the Alabama coastline , and skimming vessels were responding to confirmed reports of oil . Beach support teams were also being mobilized in anticipation of oil coming ashore . Raising the stakes still further , Tuesday was the official start of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , which forecasters predict may be the most intense since 2005 . That year Hurricane Katrina ravaged the region and disrupted offshore oil and gas output . Experts fear a big storm could drive more oil ashore and force BP and the U.S. government to suspend cleanup efforts . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Instead , I read hundreds of blogs blaming Obama for this disaster and `` not acting quickly enough . '' I suppose that people want him to personally swim to the site and fix it . Then , they would be happy . Why would anyone think he is not . But , think about his predicament , too . He had to spend a year fixing our economy and healthcare system . He had to rely on the fact that deregulation has led to corruption , and at any moment , another one of our great , greedy , messy constructs can collapse . Like banking , healthcare , etc. collapsed . So , Americans are bereft in a land of greed , and desperate to blame anyone except those who are truly to blame . If the government talks about regulating , everyone screams `` BIG GOVERNMENT '' or `` SOCIALISM !! '' . But if the Government does n't maintain a fleet of deep-water ROVs , oil men on-staff , drill rig on standby , etc. then people complain that the government has n't taken over the spill response . You ca n't have it both ways people . Several other oil companies and independent oil consultants have been asked and they all said this is exactly what should be done . Every thing they are trying carries increased risk of making the problem \\* worse \\* . Cutting off the BOP in an attempt to install a shut-off valve is a huge risk : the BOP may be partially closed and thus cutting it off may release more oil , or worse -- cause catastrophic failure of the cement casings , in which case expect as much oil leaked per day as we have been getting per week up until now . In that light , it makes perfect sense to try less risky things first . I also find it amusing that people have such short memories : The Bush administration is responsible for the mess the MMS has been in and the lack of oversight of drilling operations . With the economy , two wars , et al I do n't know how people expect 8 years of de-regulation to be magically un-done and all the messes cleaned up overnight . It takes years to change the direction and culture of any large organization . Nationalize BP 's property inside the U.S. , seize its assets in U.S. banks , declare martial law on its property and begin liquidating it to pay for this fiasco . This discussion is now closed .

The Justice Department will examine the companies ' actions for violations under the Clean Water Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which can be used to hold them liable for cleanup costs and reimbursement for government efforts . Additionally , the Justice Department could pursue other traditional charges if they find the companies made false statements or obstructed the investigation . `` As our review expands in the days ahead , we will be meticulous , we will be comprehensive , and we will be aggressive , '' Holder told reporters . `` We will not rest until justice is done . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . This crime should be prosecuted much more vigourouly than cutting corners that resulted in the initial accident . For example , they intend to cut off the constricted part of the pipe , which will increase the spill . This part is fine , except the new LMRP collector appears to be designed to fail . The pipe to carry the oil to the surface is only 6 ? diameter , and there is no way that is big enough . Probably the biggest crime is witholding information necessary to stop the spill .

For the next five hours , Hayward , BP executives , senior engineers and the U.S. Energy Secretary and Nobel Physicist Steven Chu , who had flown in two days earlier , grappled with the latest plan to stem the thousands of barrels of oil a day gushing from a broken well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . The scheme was called `` top kill '' and involved pumping heavy drilling fluids , known as drilling mud , into the blown-out well to stifle the flow of oil and allow the top of the well to be sealed with concrete . The technique had worked to seal other wells , but never one out of control in 5000 feet of water . There was a risk that the extra pressure caused by pumping in mud could rupture the top of the well , and increase the amount of oil gushing into the sea . Even so , Hayward and his team gave the plan a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . Quietly , they hoped an end to the devastating leak -- and BP 's five week-long , media-saturated nightmare -- might be within sight . The room they worked in measured about 30 feet by 30 feet and is normally used for training sessions . BP 's crisis unit had commandeered it and renamed it the `` intervention room '' soon after the leak began . Cables wrapped in yellow tape with the word `` warning '' written on it , snaked from the ceiling to the cheap , white laminated tables , which were crammed with laptops . Maps of the Gulf and diagrams of the equipment on the seabed covered the thin walls . Next door , in an almost identical space called the `` containment room '' , a separate group of engineers worked on strategies to capture the oil that had already leaked . The team in the intervention room pored over the results of tests to see if the well could take the pressure . The mood was `` intense '' , BP 's director for the Americas Bob Dudley told Reuters in the narrow , artificially-lit corridor outside the room during a break in deliberations . `` It 's kind of like NASA and the Apollo 13 mission in there . '' The uber-calm Dudley is n't normally given to hyperbole . He was formerly the head of TNK-BP , the British firm 's joint venture with a group of Russian oligarchs , until the billionaires turned hostile and Dudley was forced to flee the country . He talks about that experience with the emotion of an oil man discussing his wife 's choice of make-up . In Houston that afternoon , though , there was a flicker of tension in his eyes . `` It 's pretty dramatic , '' he said . p.m. , as a crowd of employees dressed in button-down shirts , casual golf shirts and cotton pants , gathered outside to wait for a decision , Hayward gave the green light and a call was made ordering the vessels above the site of the spill to start `` top kill . '' As drilling fluid flowed into the top of the well , morale in the command center lifted . Unfortunately for BP and for everyone else , top kill misfired . If this were a NASA moment , it would have been more like the Challenger disaster than Apollo 13 . With BP 's stock price plummeting and analysts predicting the leak could last until August when a relief well is completed , the stakes are starker than ever : for Hayward , his globe-straddling company and , of course , the waters and beaches and wetlands of the Gulf . On top of the technical challenges of stopping a gushing oil well , BP must contend with a public that is growing angrier by the day as well as an increasingly frustrated , and criticized , Obama administration . The White House has come under intense political pressure to take charge of the disaster -- even if it is not entirely clear what the president could do apart from stepping up rhetoric and taking a harder line on the company . In short , instead of getting easier , the coming few months will likely be even more dauntingly complicated for BP and its press-shy boss . During four days inside the Houston command center and traveling with Hayward to the site of the oil leak late last week , Reuters got an up-close picture of a company under siege . In the hours after `` top kill '' began , BP workers in Houston seemed busier than they had in the previous two days . A sense of quiet hope filled the offices . Some people even smiled . BP 's headquarters , a 20-story office block in west Houston , houses the firm 's permanent crisis center , which handles the response to things like hurricanes . There are now between 500 and 600 people , including staff from Exxon , Shell , Anadarko and Chevron , working in the center , which operates around the clock . Shifts last 12 hours , though a handover period means most are at least 13 . On the landscaped campus outside , ducks and geese play in man-made ponds and multistory car parks are crammed with top of the range muscle cars , high-end SUVs and European luxury saloons . The intervention and containment rooms sit at the heart of the command center . There 's also `` the hive '' , which has blacked out windows and a video wall broken into multiple screens . The screens show different views of BP 's remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROV -RRB- -- the miniature submarines at work thousands of feet below the Gulf . About a dozen workers in the room talk to ROV operators on vessels around the spill site , communicating through microphones that hang from the ceiling . `` It 's kind of like kids with video games but with much bigger risks , '' BP senior vice president Kent Wells said . Further along the corridor , inside the `` simops '' or simultaneous operations room , engineers coordinate the movement of the vessels involved in the crisis effort . On the day `` top kill '' began , more than a dozen large vessels , including drill ships , supply vessels and platforms were huddled in a one mile radius directly above the leaking well . In an alcove along the long corridor that connects all the rooms , BP has laid on massage therapists for workers . `` When you 're working people as hard as we are , you have to provide some stress relief , '' Wells said . The afternoon `` top kill '' began the two massage chairs were empty . Most of the workers in the command center are white , middle-aged and male . The few women present mostly fill support roles such as executive assistants or receptionists . U.S. accents are supplemented with Norwegian and British ones -- experts flown in from around the world . To make it easier for workers to know what their colleagues do , some wear red singlets with their roles stitched on the back . The center also houses a group of U.S. Coast Guards . Dressed in navy blue uniforms and heavy black boots , they are there as a reminder from Washington that the government is a part of the response effort . But the Guards are often left with little to do . On the day `` top kill '' began , they confined themselves to a tiny windowless room along the corridor , seemingly unbothered by what was happening around them . Several hours after mud began pumping into the well , Hayward emerged from the intervention room in what has become his trademark open-necked shirt . Flanked by the head of Britain 's largest financial public relations firm and by his own head of press , a former editor of the Financial Times , Hayward gave a brief update to Reuters and a local TV new crew in the `` simops '' room . Behind Hayward , five large flat-screen televisions streamed video from the sea floor . On one , drilling mud was seen gushing from the well head while another screen showed a yellow panel with dials and controls and , in red letters , the name Cameron International Corp , the Houston-based company which manufactured the failed blowout preventer that BP initially blamed for the oil spill . Under pressure from Washington , BP had added a video stream of the leaking oil well to its website . With `` top kill '' underway , Hayward cautioned against anyone trying to interpret changes in the size of the plume of oil as indication of success or failure . Not everybody listened to that warning . One BP insider said a few days later that there were `` hedge funds trading the plume '' . Hayward looked strained , and sounded cautious . `` The operation is proceeding as we planned it , '' he said . The April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which was drilling the Macondo oil prospect -- named for a fictitious down-at-heel town in a number of Gabriel Garcia Marquez stories -- killed 11 workers and triggered the disastrous oil leak . So far , it has also lopped about $ 65 billion off BP 's market capitalization and hit industry plans to expand deepwater drilling in the Gulf and in other parts of the U.S. . As the environmental disaster drags on , it is likely to have a profound impact on the way Americans and others view deepwater drilling . At first , BP responded to allegations that it had cut corners and put savings ahead of safety by diverting blame to its partners in the Gulf well . Now it says it is solely focused on stopping the leak . Behind the scenes , though , BP workers have taken on a defensive , even defiant , mood . An employee who walked into the command center canteen last week found colleagues watching CNN . `` So are they accusing us of covering stuff up again ? '' As public anger has grown , BP 's press team has taken to routing all media calls straight through to voicemail , in part because of the volume of calls urging violence against Hayward . The worst abuse comes in the early hours of the morning , press officers say , when callers appear to have had a few drinks . Louisiana-born political consultant James Carville has regularly demanded that President Barack Obama tell BP `` I 'm your daddy '' and suggested that Obama might be inclined to shoot Hayward given the chance . People posting comments on U.S. newspaper websites have called Hayward a `` jerk '' with a `` toffee-nosed accent . '' `` I understand perfectly why everyone is angry and frustrated that this leak has not been stopped , '' Hayward told Reuters late last week . `` I am angry and frustrated . I want this thing stopped as fast as I can , as we can . We want it stopped and we 're doing everything we can to stop the damn leak and we 're going to continue to do everything we can to stop the damn leak . The reality is that 's it 's a very challenging technological challenge . '' AN ENGLISHMAN AND A PRESIDENT IN THE BAYOU Two days after `` top kill '' began , Hayward touched down at Houma airport in Louisiana after a one-hour flight from Houston in a white Falcon corporate jet . He hopped into a Chevrolet Suburban -- black with blacked out windows -- and made the short drive across the parking lot to a trailer , where a group of medics tested the respiratory function of everyone booked to fly out to the spill site by helicopter . Hayward , his executive assistant and a press officer then drove the 100 yards back to the heliport , a gray one-story building whose waiting room consisted of prefabricated cabins bolted together . As Hayward left Houston earlier that morning , President Obama had arrived in Louisiana to meet with the Coast Guard , state officials and to visit a local beach . The slow-motion disaster has not spared the White House . Opinion polls say 60 percent of Americans are unhappy with the government 's response . Many in the Gulf region think the government should have acted more quickly to stop the oil spreading and should be doing more to help the thousands employed in the fishing industry . That 's the view of Carol Terrebonne , who sells shrimp to the public from a cramped roadside office in the steamy Louisiana shrimping hamlet of Golden Meadow . `` I blame both -LRB- Obama and Hayward , -RRB- '' Terrebonne said a day after Obama 's visit to the state . `` They should have done more before the oil got into our marshes . They could have brought in big skimmers right away . '' Under a bright blue sky on Friday morning , Obama and Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen , the president 's point man on the spill response , met with local officials on an otherwise deserted Fourchon beach . A sign at the entrance to the beach read `` Have fun , be safe and help keep our beach clean . '' The president walked to the edge of the water , which was lined with brightly colored oil-absorbing plastic sponges that looked a bit like cheerleader pompoms as well as a long thin tubular boom designed to catch the oil . After chatting with officials , Obama called the press over and pointed out the gooey black balls that had washed up on the sand . `` If you can see these little balls , these are the tarballs they were talking about , '' he said . `` Obviously , the concern is that until we stop the flow , we 've got problems . '' Standing beside the president was Charlotte Randolph , LaFourche Parish President . Randolph regularly fished from the beach , Obama explained . `` We want to be sure she can come back . '' A reporter asked the president if the tar balls might be natural . `` We attribute all oil that you see right now to BP , '' said Randolph . Later that day , Obama was asked how confident he was that `` top kill '' would work . `` All I can say is that we 've got the best minds working on it and we 're going to keep on at it until it is plugged , '' the president said . THE WORLD WE LIVE IN Hayward is one of those minds . A geologist by training , he joined BP out of university and rose to the top job in May 2007 . His predecessor , Lord John Browne , was forced to step down after admitting he had lied in a court bid to stop a British newspaper printing details of a gay affair . Browne 's star had already been tarnished by a 2005 explosion at BP 's Texas City operation , which left 15 workers dead and which the safety regulator blamed on cost cuts initiated by the CEO . Pipeline leaks in Alaska a year later , which BP admitted were caused in part by cost cutting , and delays on key projects , added to the company 's woes . Hayward is known by colleagues for his keen focus on the nuts and bolts of oil production . A few months after taking over , he declared that BP 's operational performance was `` terrible . '' Vowing to change the way the company worked , Hayward said he would standardize and streamline the way BP did everything from drilling wells to ensuring safe working conditions . The BP boss has a full head of dark brown hair and a boyish face . This , and his normally relaxed down-to-earth manner mean he could easily pass for someone a decade younger than his 53 years . As the crisis has dragged on , though , his face has begun to look more drawn . The night after `` top kill '' began , he worked until 4 a.m. , he had no sleep and then headed off to do breakfast television . `` I want to stop this thing as soon as anyone , '' he told Reuters . `` I want my life back . '' Unlike the camera-friendly Browne , Hayward is uncomfortable with media attention . Many in the United States have criticized comments he made early in the crisis that seemed to downplay the spill . Unfamiliar with the American political environment , Hayward has struggled to strike the right tone . `` The U.S. , has a tendency to politicize and ... sensationalize bad news , '' says John Hofmeister , the former head of Shell Oil Company , the U.S. division of Hague-based Royal Dutch Shell , the world 's second-biggest publicly listed oil company . `` For foreign-based executives to throw themselves into that debate , they do n't know the territory , they do n't know or understand how the dynamics work . They have a great deal of difficulty appreciating the nuances . '' Still , BP officials have pushed their boss to become even more visible , and in recent days he has started to give regular TV interviews . On his first trip out to the Discoverer Enterprise , a drill ship from which a failed early attempt to tackle the spill had been conducted , Hayward was accompanied by a Reuters reporter and photographer and by a three-person ABC camera crew . At the heliport in Houma waiting to board a large yellow Sikorsky chopper , Reuters asked him how he was coping with the blanket news coverage and round-the clock interview demands . `` We live in the world we live in , '' he said with a sigh . BP 's world is changing rapidly . Obama has extended a moratorium on new deepwater wells and announced stronger regulations on existing drilling . Credit Suisse estimates BP 's cleanup costs could reach $ 9.8 billion . Legal challenges are likely to add billions more . Analysts have even begun speculating whether BP might be prey to a takeover bid by Shell or Exxon Mobil Corp , a move that industry executives have in the past consistently dismissed as unlikely to gain regulatory approval . BP has made a bad situation worse thanks to crucial early missteps . In line with early estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates , the company initially said that 1,000 barrels of oil a day were spilling into the Gulf , before increasing that to 5,000 barrels a day . But as some scientists began to estimate a much higher flow rate , and especially after BP started to capture 5000 barrels a day of crude from the leak , even as thousands more barrels continued to spill into the ocean , many in Washington and around the country accused the company of covering up the extent of the spill . BP 's credibility took a further hit early last week when an independent U.S. government-sponsored panel said that the oil leak was likely discharging between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels a day . The panel , which reported its findings on May 27 , estimated that between 650,000 and 700,000 barrels of oil had already spilled into the Gulf , easily surpassing the 260,000 barrels the Exxon Valdez discharged when it ran aground in Alaska 's Prince William Sound . `` As upset as we are about the oil spill itself , we are also upset that we are not getting proper information from BP , '' Miles Grant at environmental group the National Wildlife Federation told Reuters . Early on , Hayward tried to distance BP from the well failure , telling Reuters in an interview on April 30 that `` this was not our accident '' . He repeated this message for days . `` This was not our drilling rig , it was not our equipment , it was not our people , our systems or our processes , '' he told the BBC on May 3 . The blame , he said , was better pinned on the maker of the blowout preventer or on Transocean , a publicity-shy company that BP hired to drill the well and which moved its headquarters from Houston to tax-cutting Switzerland . But documents released by the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce , which is investigating the accident , have highlighted BP 's input into the design of the well and the role BP managers played in how drilling was conducted . Senator David Vitter said that BP had seemingly `` made enormous mistakes and probably cut corners . '' That 's certainly what many along the Gulf coast believe . `` I blame the BP engineers who cut corners , '' says Rick Murdoch , 61 , a charter boat captain out of Alabama who had planned to fish Louisiana waters in May and June but now faces a bleak season . Fueling the sense of outrage , a report by the Department of the Interior 's Inspector General detailed a culture of corruption in the Minerals Management Service , the agency supposed to oversee offshore drilling . Obama said last week that the relationship between U.S. regulators and oil officials had been `` scandalously close '' . Standing on the deck of the Discoverer Enterprise last week , drips of perspiration rolling from the rim of his white plastic safety hat , Hayward appeared uncomfortable with the subject of blame . `` I am not going to speculate on half facts , innuendo and spurious gossip . We need to wait for the facts and then we can determine who was at fault , at what time , but most important : how do we ensure it does n't happen again ? '' Forty nine hours into `` top kill , '' the chopper ferrying Hayward , a Reuters reporter and photographer and the ABC crew to the Discoverer Enterprise , took off from Houma and flew south across the vast Mississippi Delta . The lush green wetlands a few hundred feet below were crisscrossed by canals cut by the oil industry decades earlier to facilitate drilling just offshore . Later , when the drills and rigs moved far out from the coastline , there was no need to go through the swamps . But the damage to the Delta has never been repaired . Hayward remained optimistic about the latest attempt to control the leaking pipe . As well as the regular `` top kill '' process , BP had tried a `` junk shot '' , injecting heavier materials , such as shredded rubber and golf balls , into the well in a bid to block it off . `` We have wrestled it to the ground but we have n't put a bullet in its head yet , '' Hayward said above the roar of the rotors . After landing on the Enterprise , which is about the length of three American football fields and resembles an oil tanker with a giant derrick fixed on top , Hayward met officials from BP and Transocean . In the waters around the Enterprise sat dozens of ships and vessels working either to stop the leak or prevent the oil spreading . Hayward said there were between 1,000 and 1,500 people in the immediate vicinity working to stop the flow . `` This is the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my almost 30 years in the oil industry , '' he said . BP 's representative on the Enterprise , which had been drilling nearby when the Deepwater Horizon exploded , is George Walker , a tall Texan with 37 years experience in the oil industry . He explained to his boss what had happened after the rig blew . `` We did everything we could , '' he said , his bottom lip quivering . Later , when a reporter asked Hayward if the technology to stop the leak should have been developed earlier , a hint of defensiveness crept into the BP boss 's voice . `` We have the technology . We just have n't had to deploy it in this situation as this situation has not occurred in 20 years in drilling in the deep water . So the technology 's here and we 're deploying it . '' On Air Force One on the flight back to Chicago that afternoon , Obama 's spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters that the president was optimistic about `` top kill '' . `` We 're hopeful and I think we 'll know over the course of the next many hours where we are , '' Gibbs said . `` The president believes that we 're making progress . '' Looking down from his chopper on the still waters of the Gulf , Hayward , too , remained hopeful . He had seen the strips of rainbow-colored sheen and patches of brown -- crude-oil mixed with dispersant -- but preferred to focus on the wider ocean . `` There 's a lot of clear water , '' he said , almost as if he was convincing himself that things would get better . `` You can see some silver sheen here but most of the area is surprisingly clear in this location . '' Less than 24 hours later BP announced `` top kill '' had failed . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The President could decide that `` covering-up '' the magnitude of this disaster with emulsifiers on the flow on the way up and on the surface back down is criminal to the Ocean and could nationalize -- commandeer -- however many ships his advisors say he needs to `` skim , baby , skim '' , get this dead carbon mess out of the ocean , burn it , and put it up in the atmosphere where we had originally planned . Nice report however the `` ... it is not entirely clear what the President could do ... '' statement completely misses the mark .

These creatures normally live in the Arctic Ocean , not the Gulf of Mexico , but they 're listed as `` sensitive biological resources '' that could be affected by an oil spill in the area in a document filed by BP last June with the U.S. Minerals Management Service . More than a month after BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig blew out and sank on April 20 , the British oil giant 's regional spill response plan drew some severe criticism from the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility . One problem with BP 's nearly 600-page spill response plan ? `` It was utterly useless in the event of a spill , '' Jeff Ruch , PEER 's executive director , said by telephone . His group , which acts as a kind of safe haven for government whistle-blowers , detailed what it called `` outright inanities '' in BP 's filing and the government 's approval of it .

Compared to Louisiana , where the waters are relatively calm and cleanup equipment and experts are nearby , the Arctic Ocean is a hostile place for oil and gas exploration .

Conducted on behalf of groups that want less fossil fuel use , the polls show hefty majorities favoring legislation to limit emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide . In the kind of harmonic convergence that sometimes happens inside the Capital Beltway , a new poll released on Monday by the Clean Energy Works campaign showed `` overwhelming public support for comprehensive clean energy legislation , '' with 61 percent of 2010 voters saying they want to limit pollution , invest in clean energy and make energy companies pay for emitting the carbon that contributes to climate change .

BP Plc 's latest attempt to plug its ruptured underwater well failed last week , raising concerns that the Gulf oil spill will continue unabated until August . The disaster will likely reshape the role government plays in overseeing oil and natural gas exploration and production off the U.S. coastlines . Already , the Interior Department has instituted a six-month moratorium on deepwater exploratory drilling and called for potentially costly new safety measures . This is likely just the start of increased federal scrutiny , with Attorney General Eric Holder visiting the Gulf Tuesday and lawmakers exploring their options to prevent similar catastrophes . Following is a look at some of the possible actions and new laws and regulations that may result from the spill . Depending on the outcome of federal investigations , BP and other companies involved in the Gulf oil spill could face criminal prosecution . The U.S. Justice Department will neither confirm nor deny that it is looking into pressing criminal charges against BP . But some lawmakers have called for the department to open an investigation into whether BP made false and misleading statements to the federal government regarding its ability to respond to oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico . In a worst-case scenario , criminal charges could lead the Interior Department to strip BP of its ability to operate its U.S. offshore oil fields . The company would then be forced to have other companies operate its leases . The Environmental Protection Agency could also potentially block BP from doing business with the U.S. government including securing lucrative contracts to supply fuel to the U.S. military . Some 33 exploratory rigs will have to cease operations at the first safe opportunity and stay out of action for the duration of the ban . During the ban , a presidential commission will be investigating the causes of the Gulf accident and issuing recommendations to avert another tragedy . It is unclear how soon deepwater exploration will be able to start again after the ban , if ever . It is all but certain that any new drilling will be done under intense scrutiny and with extensive technological and environmental requirements , however . Some lawmakers from coastal states have also called for a complete halt to offshore drilling in any new areas , saying the risk is just too great for coastal economies . The Obama administration has called off upcoming lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off the Virginia coast . Also , planned exploratory drilling in the Arctic this summer has been put on hold . Congress is not in session this week , but lawmakers were busy last Friday attempting to raise fees on oil companies . The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation that would increase the fee the industry pays to support the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to 34 cents a barrel from 8 cents a barrel . Lawmakers are still debating how much to raise the amount of money BP would be required to dole out for economic losses caused by the spill from the current cap of $ 75 million . Some lawmakers have called for a $ 10 billion cap , while others have said there should be no cap on damages companies face . Republican Senators David Vitter and Jeff Session have introduced a bill that would raise the cap to $ 150 million or damages equal to the last four quarters of the responsible company 's profits , whichever is greater . While it is unclear exactly how much the cap will be lifted , it is almost certain that BP and other oil companies drilling offshore will be responsible for covering much more than $ 75 million in economic losses in the future . Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has introduced legislation that would impose an annual fee of $ 10 for every acre leased for offshore drilling to raise money for clean energy transportation technology . Lautenberg said the fee could raise $ 1.8 billion a year . The additional fees and liability risks could hurt smaller oil and natural gas operators offshore that may not be able to handle the costs .

Below is a timeline of the spill and its impact : April 20 , 2010 - Explosion and fire on Transocean Ltd 's drilling rig Deepwater Horizon licensed to BP ; 11 workers are killed . The rig was drilling in BP 's Macondo project 42 miles southeast of Venice , Louisiana , beneath about 5,000 feet of water and 13,000 feet under the seabed . April 22 - The Deepwater Horizon rig , valued at more than $ 560 million , sinks and a five mile long oil slick is seen . April 25 - The Coast Guard says remote underwater cameras detect the well is leaking 1,000 barrels of crude oil per day . It approves a plan to have remote underwater vehicles activate a blowout preventer and stop leak . Efforts to activate the blowout preventer fail . April 28 - The Coast Guard says the flow of oil is 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- -- five times greater than first estimated . A controlled burn is held on the giant oil slick . April 29 - Obama pledges `` every single available resource , '' including the U.S. military , to contain the spreading spill . -- Obama also says BP is responsible for the cleanup . Louisiana declares state of emergency due to the threat to the state 's natural resources . April 30 - An Obama aide says no drilling will be allowed in new areas , as the president had recently proposed , until the cause of the Deepwater Horizon accident is known . -- BP Chairman Tony Hayward says the company takes full responsibility for the spill and would pay all legitimate claims and the cost of the cleanup . May 2 - Obama visits the Gulf Coast to see cleanup efforts first hand . U.S. officials close areas affected by the spill to fishing for an initial period of 10 days . BP starts to drill a relief well alongside the failed well , a process that could take two to three months to complete . May 5 - A barge begins towing a 98-ton containment chamber to the site of the leak . BP says one of the three leaks has been shut off by capping a valve , but that would not cut the amount of oil gushing out . May 6 - Oil washes ashore on the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast , uninhabited barrier islands that are part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge . May 7 - BP tries to lower a containment dome over the leak , but the 100-tonne device was rendered useless by a slush of frozen hydrocarbons that clogged it . -- A fishing ban for federal waters off the Gulf is modified , expanded and extended to May 17 . May 9 - BP says it might try to plug the undersea leak by pumping materials such as shredded up tires and golf balls into the well at high pressure , a method called a `` junk shot . '' May 11\\/12 - Executives from BP , Transocean and Halliburton appear at congressional hearings in Washington . Senate Energy committee chairman Jeff Bingaman says that it appeared that the explosion on the rig was due to a `` cascade of errors , technical , human and regulatory . The executives blame each other 's companies . May 14 - Obama slams companies involved in the spill , criticizing them for a `` ridiculous spectacle '' of publicly trading blame over the accident in his sternest comments yet . May 16 - BP succeeds in inserting a tube into the leaking well and capturing some oil and gas . May 18 - The U.S. nearly doubles a no-fishing zone in waters affected by the oil , extending it to 19 percent of U.S. waters in the Gulf . May 19 - The first heavy oil from the spill sloshes ashore in fragile Louisiana marshlands and part of the mess enters a powerful current that could carry it to Florida and beyond . May 26 - A `` top kill '' maneuver starts involving pumping heavy fluids and other material into the well shaft to stifle the flow , then sealing it with cement . May 28 - Obama tours the Louisiana Gulf coast on his second visit - `` I am the president and the buck stops with me , '' he said . -- BP CEO Tony Hayward flies over the Gulf . BP says that the cost of the disaster so far is $ 930 million . May 29 - BP says the complex `` top kill '' maneuver to plug the well has failed , crushing hopes for a quick end to the largest oil spill in U.S. history already in its 40th day . May 31 - The U.S. government and BP are warning that the blown-out oil well may not be stopped until August as the company prepares a new attempt to capture leaking crude . June 1 - BP shares plunge 17 percent in London trading , wiping $ 23 billion off its market value , on news its latest attempt to plug the well has failed . -LRB- Reporting by Erwin Seba and Ros Krasny : Additional writing and editing by David Cutler , London Editorial Reference Unit -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The TV show `` Issues '' on Headline News channel is saying they will have the some revealing news regarding this pathetic oil spill tonight on the show . They are truley pathetic . It is almost as if they are trying to not fix it . Weeks ago I submitted suggestions on the BP site . They asked for suggestion form the public , engineers , etc. . It had to just be a publicity stunt . Thet are still trying the same old failed attempts . My second suggestion to them is still better than any they tried . Take a 16 inch or larger flexible pipe surrounded at the bottom 50 feet with several inflatable high pressure bags\\/balloons . Have the robots insert the pipe into the damaged well hole . The pipe is open to help the pressure go up the pipe and not push the pipr out . When the pipe is inserted deep enough to cover the inflatable balloons , fill them with the proper viscosity fluid to withstand the atmospheric pressure . This will fill the gap around the pipe and prevent oil from escaping . If they can put all the junk and smaller pipes into the hole they can put this pipe in the hole as well . The oil will flow into the pipe to the ships and barges waiting for the oil . They should have and could have done this weeks ago . What are they thinking ? Anybody that uses a car to get from point A to point B shares the blame for the oil spill . BP would not be in this risky business if we had not created the demand for it . So the spill is OUR problem , as many of us have recognized from the outset . Even those that do not drive still get their goods and services from those that do . But before we get too far ahead with finger-pointing , we ought to first plug the well . Since conventional ideas have not worked , anybody s thoughts are as good as another s . No idea is foolish , if it could somehow work . So share your thoughts with the rests of us . We re in this together . This discussion is now closed .

The company 's latest plan is to siphon off some of the oil but first robot submarines must cut away what is left of the ruined offshore well 's leaking riser pipe . Then a containment cap can be lowered over the remaining wellhead assembly , enabling BP to funnel crude to the surface . But the diamond-tipped saw being used to cut through the pipe became stuck . BP employed robotic equipment and struggled for hours to free the saw but finally completed the task , a source familiar with the operation told Reuters . If the saw cuts off remaining pieces of the pipe and provides a smooth surface at the top , BP aims to place a containment cap with a rubber seal over the gushing opening to funnel most of the oil . All this is a difficult task one mile deep . As the desperate effort to contain the gusher proceeded , the slick stretched farther . Tar balls and other oil debris from the giant , fragmented slick reached Alabama 's Dauphin Island , parts of Mississippi and were less than 10 miles from Florida 's northwest Panhandle coast . The region 's vital seafood and tourism industries were at risk from America 's biggest oil spill ever . Florida , entering the busy beach season , is ramping up reconnaissance efforts and preparing to deploy more booms and conduct coastal cleanups . Officials prepared for landfall that could come as early as Friday . BP , now facing an Obama administration criminal investigation , has lost one-third of its market value or about $ 67 billion -LRB- 46 billion pounds -RRB- since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 and triggered the gusher . The company 's latest plan to curb the oil flow after the `` top kill '' strategy failed could represent the last best hope before August , when the company expects to have two relief wells it is drilling to be operational . This latest attempted fix may actually increase the flow of oil , at least temporarily , before the leak can be controlled . President Barack Obama , facing one of the biggest challenges to his presidency , is under relentless pressure to stop the leak . Vice President Joe Biden rejected criticism of the administration 's handling of the disaster . `` From my perspective , I think if there 's any mistake made -LRB- it is -RRB- that we have n't communicated clearly enough what the president has done on this oil spill from the beginning , '' Biden told PBS ' `` Charlie Rose '' show . In a speech in Pittsburgh , Obama said it is time for the United States to embrace a clean energy future because of the inherent risks of drilling deep into the earth for oil . `` The catastrophe unfolding in the Gulf right now may prove to be a result of human error -- or corporations taking dangerous short-cuts that compromised safety , '' Obama said . BP shares recovered from an earlier dip to close nearly unchanged in London on Wednesday , while BP American depositary receipts rose more than a point in New York ; both equities plunged over 10 percent on Tuesday . Some investors see this as a rare buying opportunity . Others said the stocks could underperform for years despite reduced valuations , and warned the uncertain outcome of the oil spill and risk to profits means investors should expect a bumpy ride in coming months . The cost of insuring the debt of BP , rig operator Transocean and Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which owns a 25 percent stake in the well , hit fresh highs on Wednesday as concerns grew about the companies ' exposure to the spill . Credit default swaps protecting BP 's debt jumped 87 basis points to a record 255 basis points , or $ 255,000 per year to insure $ 10 million for five years , according to Markit Intraday . The swaps have jumped from around 100 basis points last Friday and 42 basis points in April . BP will seek to patch up its battered share price by reassuring investors the cost of cleaning up the spill is manageable and will not affect dividends , British media reported on Wednesday . BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told the Financial Times that he believed the industry could reform itself to justify continued drilling in challenging areas . In a statement , Hayward apologized for saying on Sunday that `` I want my life back , '' a comment that stirred anger in the Gulf region where the spill is destroying livelihoods . `` Those words do n't represent how I feel about this tragedy , '' he said . A section of Dauphin Island beach well known for its white sand was covered with patches of black and an orange sheen . Hundreds of workers and around 150 boats set out to lay more protective booms around the island , though they were delayed by a squall that passed over the tourist haven off Alabama 's Gulf Coast . `` It is so depressing . It is really happening . It really wo n't go away . And the American people really do n't know what has hit them , '' said Dauphin Island homeowner Caroline Graves . The containment cap is intended to capture a large portion of the billowing oil and channel it through a hose to a ship on the surface . BP must make two cuts on the riser pipe , with the second cut key to ensuring that BP gets a clean seal between the pipe and the containment cap . The cap also is equipped with valves to allow operators to inject methanol or warm water that would prevent the buildup of slushy gas hydrates that thwarted an earlier siphoning effort . But sawing off the end of the damaged riser pipe through which oil has been pouring non-stop could increase the flow of crude by 20 percent until the cap is in place . It could take 72 hours to get the cap operational . As much as 19,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 800,000 gallons or 3 million liters -RRB- a day has been pouring into the Gulf off the coast of Louisiana since the rig explosion . The accident ranks as the worst oil spill in U.S. history , surpassing the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker disaster in Alaska . The spreading slick coincided with the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season , which forecasters say could be the stormiest since 2005 , when Katrina and Rita wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast . Commercial fishing , shrimping and oyster harvests have been shut down for weeks along much of the Gulf Coast , home to a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry . While cleanup crews have attacked the oil slick on the surface with skimmers , dispersants and controlled burns , shoreline-protection teams have scurried to block the spread of oil with containment booms , sandbags and other barriers . Scientists and Gulf residents are most concerned about the encroachment of oil into bayous and marshes teeming with shrimp , oysters , crabs , fish , birds and other wildlife . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . President Obama should be assembling a team of the finest engineers to find a solution to this debacle . He is not acting with the environment 's best interests at heart . Because I 'm sure there are alot of engineers that Obama has just , not felt like calling already . And you know , the White House and it 's dozen Departments can only do one thing at a time . Is it possible they 've called all the engineers they can get ahold of ? Is it possible for the Department of Justice to pursue this while the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy work on the well ? Stop being ignorant and think .

Cameron , the director of `` Avatar '' and `` Titanic , '' has worked extensively with robot submarines and is considered an expert in undersea filming . He did not say explicitly who he meant when he referred to `` those morons . '' His comments came a day after he participated in a meeting at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency headquarters in Washington to `` brainstorm '' solutions to the oil spill . Cameron said he has offered to help the government and BP in dealing with the spill . He said he was `` graciously '' turned away by the British energy giant . He said he has not spoken with the White House about his offer , and said that the outside experts who took part in the EPA meeting were now `` writing it all up and putting in reports to the various agencies . '' The film director has helped develop deep-sea submersible equipment and other underwater ocean technology for the making of documentaries exploring the wrecks of the ocean liner Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck some two miles below the surface . Cameron suggested the U.S. government needed to take a more active role in monitoring the undersea gusher , which has become the worst oil spill in U.S. history . `` I know really , really , really smart people that work typically at depths much greater than what that well is at , '' Cameron said . The BP oil spill off the U.S. Gulf Coast is located a mile below the surface . While acknowledging that his contacts in the deep-sea industry do not drill for oil , Cameron said that they are accustomed to operating various underwater vehicles and electronic optical fiber systems . `` Most importantly , '' he added , `` they know the engineering that it requires to get something done at that depth . '' Among the key issues that Cameron said he is interested in helping the government with are methods of monitoring the oil leak and investigating it . `` The government really needs to have its own independent ability to go down there and image the site , survey the site and do its own investigation , '' he said . `` Because if you 're not monitoring it independently , you 're asking the perpetrator to give you the video of the crime scene , '' Cameron added . Cameron made two documentaries about the wreck of the Titanic as well as the blockbuster 1997 movie `` Titanic '' using a small fleet of specially designed remotely operated underwater vehicles . He said his qualifications are not based on his background as a movie director but on his years of involvement in the deep-sea industry . -LRB- Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic , with additional reporting by Jill Sergeant -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Of course , he 'll do anything he can to appease his trial court lawyer buddies . Maybe that 's why the first thing he tried to do on this matter was raise the liability to 10 billion dollars which accomplishes absolutely nothing with respect to stopping or stemming the flow of oil into the Gulf or even cleaning it up for that matter . Obama , you have betrayed your base on this matter . This thing appalls me as it should anyone else with at least a semblance of decency . Listen to what Cameron said . He offered to help through both bp and the Obama admin . He got turned down by bp . The fact that Obama is allowing himself to be pulled around like a dog on a leash -LRB- by bp of all people -RRB- ought to appall anyone out there . BP should have been `` pushed aside '' on this matter long ago and the feds are obligated to take it over . I 'm not trying to villanize BP over this matter . It would be way premature -LRB- and most likely counter - productive -RRB- to publicly show such sentiment . You say criminal charges Holder ? Jesus says , `` He that is without sin amongst you let him cast the first stone . '' If BP is criminally culpable in this , you 'd better believe there are people in the government 's regulatory bodies that are at least equally criminally culpable if not more so . So , got get ` em Obama\\/Holder . They say this is Obama 's Katrina . I say it is worse than Katrina . It is even worse than Bush senior 's sickening response to the Exxon Valdez disaster . Good riddance to you Obama\\/Holder in 2012 . This gets to be silly fast . What exactly is the problem that Cameron is offering to solve ? That is not a problem in this case , they have all sorts of observations . They have that too . lack of skill does not appear to be the problem . Is BP the problem ? They are focusing on trying to stop the spill , hard enough to do without the threats of jail time . One wonders if somebody will suggest capital punishment for such disasters . This is the way the Mafia operates , make a mistake and you end up in a dumpster . James1976 wrote : `` Jesus says , He that is without sin amongst you let him cast the first stone .

L -RRB- , reversing its view that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill would have a limited financial impact on the company , and was joined by Moody 's as fears grow over clean-up and legal costs . `` The downgrade of BP 's ratings reflects Fitch 's opinion that risks to both BP 's business and financial profile continue to increase following the Deepwater Horizon accident , '' Fitch said on Thursday . The BP oil spill , which began in April , is causing an ecological and economic catastrophe along the U.S. Gulf coast . Estimates for the total cost to BP range from $ 5.3 billion from Dutch bank ING to $ 37 billion from Credit Suisse . Fitch in May admitted to a mistake when it assumed that the impact of the spill on BP 's finances would be mitigated by insurance . However , Fitch said at the time the impact of the spill on BP 's credit rating remained limited . BP insures its own operations in the United States , rather than using commercial insurers , which means it is responsible for funding the clean-up -LRB- ID : nN30179546 -RRB- -LRB- ID : nLDE6441W9 -RRB- But on Thursday the agency downgraded its rating on BP debt to AA from AA + and attached a negative outlook , citing substantial additional risks including clean-up and legal costs . Other factors that could lead to further downgrades include the oil well flow rate permanently increasing , the relief well being drilled by BP failing to completely arrest the oil flow and clean-up costs exceeding Fitch 's worst-case scenario of around $ 5 billion in any one year , the agency added . Moody 's also on Thursday cut the group 's ratings by one notch to Aa2 from Aa1 , also citing the clean-up and legal costs , and placed the group on review for further possible downgrades . `` Moody 's expects these costs to weigh significantly on BP 's free cash flow generating capacity and to constrain its ability to focus on other key areas of the company 's business in the near to intermediate term , '' it said . Reuters reported on Tuesday that a $ 23 billion slide in BP 's market value and a surge in the cost of protecting its debt were due to fears oil could continue spewing into the sea for another two months at least and that BP 's latest bid to stem the flow could make matters worse . Five-year credit default swaps on BP were about 30 basis points tighter on Thursday at around 230 basis points , according to data from Markit . On Wednesday , the cost of insuring BP 's debt via CDS had soared , with BP 's five-year CDS widening at one stage by 100 basis points to a record 270 basis points . The other main rating agency , Standard & Poor 's , which on May 7 revised its outlook for BP to negative from stable , has said it is reviewing ratings on around 35 companies as a result of a temporary ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . Shares in BP gained as much as 4.7 percent on Thursday as a call with analysts planned for Friday gave hope there would be an update on the company 's plans for its dividend which is seen to be threatened by the growing cost of the spill . Two U.S. Senators said on Wednesday BP should cut its dividend until the full costs for the clean-up can be calculated . The stock was up 2.6 percent at 440.8 pence by 1336 GMT , back in line with European peers . SXEP , and outperforming a 1.8 percent higher UK market . `` Maybe some people have decided that on a risk reward basis the value 's there , '' said UBS analyst Jon Rigby , who added that most people 's estimates of the cost of the spill is now `` hugely '' over-discounted in the stock .

Here are some potential scenarios facing BP : BP RUNS OUT OF CASH - UNLIKELY BP and the White House have said the oil giant has the financial muscle to cover the cost of cleaning up the oil spill and compensating those affected . All analysts consulted by Reuters agree on this , and that the key determinant of how much it does finally cost depends on how long the oil continues to flow . Analysts and investors have started to factor in that the spill lasts until August , when a relief well is expected to be completed . The relief well would end the spill even if earlier efforts to cap the ruptured well have failed . BP 's market capitalization has fallen by around $ 65 billion since the Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 after exploding two days earlier , unleashing a torrent of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . Most analysts believe this more than factors in the total cost to BP . `` It 's not going to be anything in that ball park , '' Alex Morris , oil analyst at Raymond James in Houston said . Estimates for the total cost start at around $ 5.3 billion , an estimate from Dutch bank ING , assuming the current effort to fit a cap on the well to capture the oil works . However , estimates run to up to $ 37 billion -- the forecast from investment bank Credit Suisse . As costs , especially those for damages , will be absorbed over a period of years , BP is seen as able to handle them . The company generated cash of $ 7.7 billion from operating activities in the first quarter . Even after capital investment of $ 3.8 billion , it had $ 3.9 billion of free cash . Most analysts believe the company can foot the bill without cutting its dividend or raising debt levels . However , Credit Suisse said if its $ 37 billion estimate is accurate , the company can only maintain its dividend by raising its gearing ratio by 10 percentage points , something it may not wish to do . And even if BP can afford to maintain its dividend , it may cut it as a political gesture to bolster its flagging reputation . Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Ron Wyden said on Wednesday BP should cut its dividend until the full costs for cleaning up the spill can be calculated . BP , which owns 65 percent of the leaking well , its partners Anadarko Petroleum , which owns 25 percent and Japan 's Mitsui & Co , which owns 10 percent , are legally liable for the clean-up on the basis of their shareholdings . BP has undertaken to cover all damages itself . CEO Hayward said in an interview with Britain 's The Daily Mail newspaper on Wednesday that clean-up costs could hit $ 3 billion if the leak continues until August . This is based on BP 's estimate of around $ 950 million spent in the first 41 days after the explosion . However , Credit Suisse estimated in a research note on Wednesday that clean-up costs could total $ 15-23 billion . Other analysts put the number as low as the $ 2 billion estimated by Panmure Gordon 's Peter Hitchens . BP has agreed to compensate all those affected by the spill for all legitimate costs , even though under the law BP and its partners are only liable to pay up to $ 75 million . BP has undertaken to pay this money itself , rather than in conjunction with its partners , so the full liability may fall to it . BP has offered no estimate but Hitchens at Panmure said on Wednesday he estimates compensation claims will be $ 10 billion . Credit Suisse estimates this at $ 23 billion . BP BECOMES A TAKEOVER TARGET - UNLIKELY The collapse in its share price means BP could become a takeover target , Dougie Youngson , oil analyst at brokerage Arbuthnot said on Tuesday . However , most analysts do not expect this to happen . Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the only fully publicly traded oil companies larger than BP and deemed financially strong enough to buy it . The U.S. government blocked the takeover of Asia-focused U.S. oil company Unocal by China 's CNOOC for strategic reasons , so most analysts doubt it would allow BP -- the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico -- to be taken over by a state-backed oil company . Antitrust issues could arise over BP 's refineries if it were acquired by Exxon , Shell or Chevron , Alex Morris said . This could force the sale of the refineries but in the current depressed refining environment that would be difficult . BP 's significant U.S. gas production assets could also cause regulatory problems for any of the above , Jason Kenney at ING said . However , the biggest barriers to an acquirer making a move are the unknown liabilities that arise from the spill . `` It would be hard to see one of the other supermajors taking on such an unknown liability , '' Raymond James 's Morris said . Similarly , selling of BP piecemeal may not attract buyers because the individual parts would still be liable for the spill . Washington may also block any deal seen to strengthen anyone in the oil industry . `` The last thing that President -LRB- Barack -RRB- Obama needs today is `` bigger oil , '' ING 's Kenney said in a research note . CEO HAYWARD LOSES HIS JOB - UNLIKELY , FOR THE MOMENT Inevitably , there have been questions over whether Hayward should stay . He told the Daily Mail '' ... it would be ridiculous to resign at this point '' and most analysts have defended the CEO 's position . John Hofmeister , former president of Shell Oil Company , Shell 's U.S. unit , and author of `` Why We Hate the Oil Companies , '' told Reuters it was unreasonable to blame the CEO . `` Ultimately the CEO is accountable and responsible ... but the individual on the rig may have a made a bad judgment . '' Investors had been happy with Hayward 's efforts as CEO . In the almost three years before the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk , he had improved refinery operations , boosted oil production and cut a lot of management overheads . `` People were happy with him -- he had done a good job turning around BP , '' Alex Morris said . So far , investors and analysts seem to be backing Hayward . However , documents and testimony submitted to government investigations into the incident have prompted some in Washington and Louisiana to question BP 's decisions about the drilling of the oil well . Hayward took up his role promising to standardize and streamline the way BP built facilities and drilled oil wells . If the structures he put in place are deemed to have led to any decisions that contributed to the accident , then the CEO 's position could come under pressure . BP IS BARRED FROM DOING SOME BUSINESS IN THE U.S. . AT LEAST TEMPORARILY - SOMEWHAT LIKELY Some commentators have called for BP to be banned from drilling in the United States , which would seriously damage the company 's business given that 40 percent of its assets are in the United States and it depends on the country for its growth plans . Analysts are divided on whether some debarment is likely . `` There are going to be heavy fines . The regulator is going to be tough on them getting permits but all companies have to be treated by the rules . This is n't Venezuela , '' said Morris . However , under federal law BP would have to be banned from government contracts for a period of time if convicted of a criminal offense under the Clean Water Act . The company could also be barred from contracts if civil judgments are entered against it for violations of environmental laws . BP has already faced partial bans on receiving federal contracts because of past violations of U.S. laws . After the pipeline leaks at its Prudhoe Bay Unit in Alaska and a fatal explosion at a Texas refinery , the company was ineligible to receive federally funded contracts for services from those two facilities . The company had been negotiating with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over those bans but those talks were halted after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . While BP could face such a penalty in the latest oil spill , one law professor and private practitioner , Anthony Sabino , noted that there were not a lot of other oil producers so it might only be a short-term debarment . That could be viewed as a punitive and politically motivated action , but regardless such a ban would likely `` be a short-term hit and not substantial , '' he said . BP TO FACE FINES AND PENALTIES - LIKELY In addition to facing billions of dollars in costs from the economic liability and damages , BP could also potentially face billions of dollars in civil and criminal penalties if the Justice Department 's investigation finds wrongdoing . Some legal experts have said that proving some criminal charges may be more difficult because it requires showing intent , negligence or other malfeasance . However , some environmental laws have simple criminal violations , including the one banning harm to migratory birds . For each barrel of oil that prosecutors can prove has spilled into the Gulf , BP could be fined $ 1,100 or as much as $ 4,300 if they are able to prove negligence was the cause . Prosecutors could use estimates from a team of scientists and experts who found between 12,000 barrels per day and 19,000 bpd are flowing from the broken well . That could equal as much as $ 81.7 million in fines per day at the high end . With 44 days of oil spewing from the well , that would equal $ 3.6 billion as of Wednesday . Additionally , U.S. laws protect endangered species and migratory birds , with fines of up to $ 25,000 per violation . Already more than 100 birds have been found oiled or dead , according to the Unified Area Command for the spill response efforts . There are also criminal fines associated with such violations , which could be as much as $ 50,000 . If other companies are also found to be responsible for the spill as well , the penalties could potentially be imposed on each violator . In some cases , most significantly the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 , companies try to negotiate a settlement with the federal government , as is expected with BP . Two years after the Valdez spill , Exxon settled U.S. civil and criminal charges in a plea agreement that included just over $ 1 billion in penalties , damages and restitution . At the time , the $ 125 million in criminal penalties was the largest of its kind while $ 900 million went to reimburse federal and state governments for responding to the spill and later restoration projects . The federal government and state of Alaska in 2006 sought another $ 92 million from Exxon , however that request has not been resolved . BP TO FACE GROWTH HEADWINDS IN THE FUTURE - LIKELY BP 's targets for expanded production will become tougher to achieve following the oil spill , and its financial performance will suffer from higher costs -- even after spill costs and fines are paid . BP said earlier this year it was targeting oil and gas output growth of 1-2 percent over the medium term . This plan relies heavily on BP 's U.S. projects and especially the Gulf of Mexico , where it was leading the push into ever-deeper waters . The dislocation caused by dealing with the spill , including the diversion of vessels from other fields means BP will face a particular challenge in keeping its drilling plans on track . A moratorium imposed by Obama on new deepwater drilling after the spill will also slow development plans at BP and across the industry . Even when the oil spill has been dealt with and the drilling moratorium is lifted , BP 's damaged reputation is likely to mean more scrutiny from regulators than other companies , analysts said . This means it will likely take longer than it would have expected in the past to bring fields to production . `` The Gulf of Mexico position was much heralded by management as a differentiated position for BP relative to its peers only 12 months ago ... the full monetization of these assets is likely to take longer , '' Morgan Stanley oil analyst Theepan Jothilingam said in a research note . Lower-than-expected production would hit BP 's financial performance but in addition to this , higher costs could weigh on BP 's profits . Analysts at Bernstein estimated the company could face 10 percent higher operating costs in the United States after the spill , in part due to the need to impose tougher safety standards . "}, {"uid": "830", "dct": "2010-06-03", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Here are some potential scenarios facing BP : BP RUNS OUT OF CASH - UNLIKELY BP and the White House have said the oil giant has the financial muscle to cover the cost of cleaning up the oil spill and compensating those affected . All analysts consulted by Reuters agree on this , and that the key determinant of how much it does finally cost depends on how long the oil continues to flow . Analysts and investors have started to factor in that the spill lasts until August , when a relief well is expected to be completed . The relief well would end the spill even if earlier efforts to cap the ruptured well have failed . BP 's market capitalization has fallen by around $ 65 billion since the Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 after exploding two days earlier , unleashing a torrent of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . Most analysts believe this more than factors in the total cost to BP . `` It 's not going to be anything in that ball park , '' Alex Morris , oil analyst at Raymond James in Houston said . Estimates for the total cost start at around $ 5.3 billion , an estimate from Dutch bank ING , assuming the current effort to fit a cap on the well to capture the oil works . -LRB- ID : nN02139553 -RRB- However , estimates run to up to $ 37 billion -- the forecast from investment bank Credit Suisse . As costs , especially those for damages , will be absorbed over a period of years , BP is seen as able to handle them . The company generated cash of $ 7.7 billion from operating activities in the first quarter . Even after capital investment of $ 3.8 billion , it had $ 3.9 billion of free cash . Most analysts believe the company can foot the bill without cutting its dividend or raising debt levels . However , Credit Suisse said if its $ 37 billion estimate is accurate , the company can only maintain its dividend by raising its gearing ratio by 10 percentage points , something it may not wish to do . And even if BP can afford to maintain its dividend , it may cut it as a political gesture to bolster its flagging reputation . Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Ron Wyden said on Wednesday BP should cut its dividend until the full costs for cleaning up the spill can be calculated . -LRB- ID : nWAT014519 -RRB- BP , which owns 65 percent of the leaking well , its partners Anadarko Petroleum , which owns 25 percent and Japan 's Mitsui & Co , which owns 10 percent , are legally liable for the clean-up on the basis of their shareholdings . BP has undertaken to cover all damages itself . CEO Hayward said in an interview with Britain 's The Daily Mail newspaper on Wednesday that clean-up costs could hit $ 3 billion if the leak continues until August . This is based on BP 's estimate of around $ 950 million spent in the first 41 days after the explosion . However , Credit Suisse estimated in a research note on Wednesday that clean-up costs could total $ 15-23 billion . Other analysts put the number as low as the $ 2 billion estimated by Panmure Gordon 's Peter Hitchens . BP has agreed to compensate all those affected by the spill for all legitimate costs , even though under the law BP and its partners are only liable to pay up to $ 75 million . BP has undertaken to pay this money itself , rather than in conjunction with its partners , so the full liability may fall to it . BP has offered no estimate but Hitchens at Panmure said on Wednesday he estimates compensation claims will be $ 10 billion . Credit Suisse estimates this at $ 23 billion . BP BECOMES A TAKEOVER TARGET - UNLIKELY The collapse in its share price means BP could become a takeover target , Dougie Youngson , oil analyst at brokerage Arbuthnot said on Tuesday . However , most analysts do not expect this to happen . Exxon Mobil -LRB- XOM . N -RRB- , Royal Dutch Shell -LRB- RDSa . L -RRB- and Chevron -LRB- CVX . N -RRB- are the only fully publicly traded oil companies larger than BP and deemed financially strong enough to buy it . The U.S. government blocked the takeover of Asia-focused U.S. oil company Unocal by China 's CNOOC for strategic reasons , so most analysts doubt it would allow BP -- the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico -- to be taken over by a state-backed oil company . Antitrust issues could arise over BP 's refineries if it were acquired by Exxon , Shell or Chevron , Alex Morris said . This could force the sale of the refineries but in the current depressed refining environment that would be difficult . BP 's significant U.S. gas production assets could also cause regulatory problems for any of the above , Jason Kenney at ING said . However , the biggest barriers to an acquirer making a move are the unknown liabilities that arise from the spill . `` It would be hard to see one of the other supermajors taking on such an unknown liability , '' Raymond James 's Morris said . Similarly , selling of BP piecemeal may not attract buyers because the individual parts would still be liable for the spill . Washington may also block any deal seen to strengthen anyone in the oil industry . `` The last thing that President -LRB- Barack -RRB- Obama needs today is `` bigger oil , '' ING 's Kenney said in a research note .

But oil-auto companies have spent billions killing the real alternatives to oil-burning cars : solar power and plug-in Electric cars . We drive them every day , and make more electric on our rooftop than we need to drive 2000 miles per month -LRB- two Toyota NiMH RAV4-EV -RRB- . What 's stopping others from doing so ? Chevron-GM sued Toyota to kill use of NiMH Nickel batteries , the only proven battery that lasts longer than the life of the car ; and government opposes solar power , preferring to fund tax breaks and handouts to coal and nuke power scammers . Nickel-Metal Hydride is the only proven EV -LRB- Electric Vehicle -RRB- battery ; after 100K or 200K miles NiMH can be remelted down into new batteries without new mining . Instead of `` research '' , we need to start making and improving plug-in cars right now , not waiting for the perfect that never comes . Lowering cost is the name of the game . Solar power and plug-in cars is the only sustainable way to power individual autos . Running an EV 1000 miles per month takes only 250 kilo-Watt-hours of electric , about $ 25 worth ; about what two old refrigerators cost and about a third of the average home usage . It would take only a tenth of the average home roof -- 6 square yards -- to make 250 kWh per month , enough electric energy to run a plug-in car 1000 miles per month . Because solar power and plug-in cars would cut oil profits , Big Oil has used its financial power to strangle and delay use of these obviously simple and working alternative to oil and coal . No matter how many nuke or coal plants we build , it wo n't replace one drop of oil unless there are plug-in cars to use the electric ; but if we had plug-in cars , we would n't even need new power plants . The money not spent on oil pays for solar . We can make it happen . America 's largest open-pit coal mine is a witches cauldron of toxic waste and caustic destruction ; but if the ground were left alone , and covered with solar panels , we 'd get more electric energy from the same space -LRB- 28,000 acres -RRB- than we get from the coal . Instead of risking death in criminal coal mines , or skirting safety rules on oil rigs , the same workers could be manufacturing and installing solar panels and building and recycling electric plug-in cars and reforming their batteries . Electric cars are all powered with American electrons ; no electric is imported . Buying oil from people who hate us gives them our money and leaves only air and ground pollution , asthma and smog after it 's burned . If there were no alternative to oil-fired cars , the permanent lung damage caused by burning oil might be necessary ; but there IS an alternative , solar and plug-in cars . There is no higher cost than killing your kids lungs - and the Earth - to enrich Big Oil . it could happen to any company , that is new to the industry ? That will take years so the financial impact most likely will be divided on several years as for the valdez incident . In the end , with probable stricter regulations on offshore drilling as well as the fallout effects on higher liability costs , of which these costs will be passed on to each one of us , will this be enough to either force more alternative energy use or just make US production uncompetitive against foreign oil , ie . from the middle east ? The latter of which would be hypocritical , as the energy policy is to be more energy independent and keep US dollars at home to be put to good use in pumping up the nuclear industry that have probably backed so many key policy makers that would make everyone believe that nuclear power is clean and without risks vs. oil .

The energy giant 's robot submarines sheared off the pipe rising above the crippled wellhead assembly after more than two days of trying , setting the stage for an attempt to lower a containment apparatus over the oil-spewing pipe . Despite the initial success in its latest effort to curb the flowing crude , BP 's financial outlook was further clouded as two credit-rating agencies downgraded the company 's debt , reflecting assessments that BP faces lasting damage . Hours later , the Obama administration said it had sent a preliminary bill for $ 69 million to BP and `` other responsible parties '' to cover oil spill costs . The U.S. disaster response chief , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , said BP would begin trying later on Thursday to position a containment cap over the wellhead assembly to start bringing at least some of the escaping oil and gas to the surface , where it would be collected on ships and safely removed . BP chief executive Tony Hayward said the next 12 to 24 hours will determine whether the capping operation will succeed . `` It 's an important milestone , '' Hayward said in Houston , adding , `` This is simply the beginning . '' It was the first glimmer of hope for BP after many futile attempts to contain an oil leak that is belching 19,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico . Allen called the day 's developments a `` significant step forward . '' BP does not expect to be able to fully halt the oil flow until August , when two relief wells are due for completion . President Barack Obama , seeking to contain political fallout from the disaster , planned to visit the Louisiana Gulf coast again on Friday to view what has eclipsed the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Obama told CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' to be broadcast on Thursday night that he is `` furious at this entire situation '' in the Gulf because `` somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions . '' Obama said he has not seen enough of a rapid response from BP . The U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research projected that the oil slick would be driven by wind and currents around the Florida peninsula by early summer and up the East Coast , possibly as far as North Carolina . The Coast Guard said late on Thursday that oil spill investigators were responding to renewed reports of tar balls and other oily debris near several islands in the Florida Keys , which extend from the southern tip of the Florida peninsula . But the substances will be tested to see if they originated from the Gulf spill . Tar balls found in the Keys weeks ago were determined to be unrelated to the blowout . Ratings agencies Moody 's and Fitch Ratings downgraded BP 's credit ratings on Thursday and said they might cut them further on rising concerns over clean-up and legal costs . Fitch , which in May admitted it had been wrong to assume that the impact of the spill on BP 's finances would be eased by insurance , said clean-up costs could exceed its worst-case scenario of around $ 5 billion in any one year . Shares in BP , which are traded in London and New York , had a roller-coaster day but eventually jumped in New York by 4 about percent . Elsewhere in the sector , shares of Halliburton Co. were down about 0.4 percent and Cameron International dropped 0.7 percent in late trading . Two U.S. lawmakers have called on BP to suspend shareholder dividends until the full costs of the oil spill cleanup are calculated . London-based investment bank Evolution Securities said in a research note : `` We believe BP will bow to political pressure in the U.S. and suspend dividend payments for the remainder of 2010 . '' Hayward , seeking to reassure the rattled residents of the Gulf coast , vowed BP would work to sop up the mess and would stay `` until every drop of oil has been recovered '' and will `` meet our obligations to our stakeholders . '' Oil has been gushing nonstop into the Gulf since April 20 , when a Transocean Ltd drilling rig licensed to BP exploded , killing 11 workers . The resulting spill has threatened to wreak havoc on the fragile ecology and economies of the Gulf Coast states while confronting the Obama administration with a key test of its ability to handle a complex and evolving crisis . In another development , the U.S. Minerals Management Service said it would no longer approving drilling permits for shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico , effectively extending a federal drilling ban the White House had said last week would end soon . Obama , whose reputation is on the line over the spill , scheduled his third visit to the Gulf on Friday . His spokesman , Robert Gibbs , dismissed suggestions by some pundits that the president should drop his calm demeanor and show more emotion . `` Pounding on a podium is not going to fix a hole in the ocean , '' Gibbs said . Washington Post columnist David Broder wrote on Thursday that Obama `` will have to hope he does n't end up as Jimmy Carter , '' the U.S. president who lost his 1980 reelection bid after failing to secure the release of hostages held in Iran for 444 days . Government forecasters said part of the far-flung oil sheen had crept to within 6 miles of Florida 's Gulf coast panhandle and was expected to reach the white , sandy shore there in days . Emergency planners kept a wary eye on two powerful currents in the Gulf , the loop ring that circles the bulk of the spill and the loop current that would carry oil south toward the Florida Keys and then up around the U.S. Eastern seaboard . They were expected to converge in 48 to 72 hours . `` Once those connect , that 's it , '' state meteorologist Amy Godsey said . Louisiana is the state hardest hit so far by oil , though the spill has fouled beaches in Mississippi and Alabama . Thousands of fishermen , shrimpers and other seafood workers have been idled for weeks by government-imposed fishing restrictions that cover 37 percent of U.S. federal waters in the Gulf . BP could face billions of dollars in fines and penalties if a Justice Department investigation finds wrongdoing , in addition to billions from the economic liability and damages , according to legal experts . It may also find it more difficult to meet targets for expanded production in the future , analysts said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The Russian 's used an explosive device to seal a well in the Arctic when it blew up . Our government needs to be able to step in and close a disaster like this down immediately . I believe that high risk explorations like this need to have severe consequences when an accident happens . We need to let BP do their job . We are not playing tiddlywinks here and are creating knowledge as we go . This accident was just that , an accident -- an unforeseen event or resulting state that requires immediate action inorder to protect life , property and the environment . The US Government needs to commit any and all resources except the legal machines to help BP . The placing of blame and tough guy approach is counter-productive .

Article from Las Vegas Review Journal : The workers who are cleaning up the oil in the Gulf need to be aware of the chemicals that will be used . I am one of the 11,000 + cleanup workers from the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- , who is suffering from health issues from that toxic cleanup , without compensation from Exxon . My name is Merle Savage ; a female general foreman during the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- beach cleanup in 1989 , which turned into 21 years of extensive health deterioration for me , and many other workers . Dr. Riki Ott visited me in 2007 to explain about the toxic spraying on the beaches . She also informed me that Exxon 's medical records and the reports that surfaced in litigation by sick workers in 1994 , had been sealed from the public , making it impossible to hold Exxon responsible for their actions . Exxon developed the toxic spraying ; OSHA , the Coast Guard , and the state of Alaska authorized the procedure ; VECO and other Exxon contractors implemented it . Beach crews breathed in crude oil that splashed off the rocks and into the air -- the toxic exposure turned into chronic breathing conditions and central nervous system problems , along with other massive health issues . Some of the illnesses include neurological impairment , chronic respiratory disease , leukemia , lymphoma , brain tumors , liver damage , and blood disease . My web site is devoted to searching for EVOS cleanup workers who were exposed to the toxic spraying , and are suffering from the same illnesses that I have .

Oil debris came ashore among swimmers and beachgoers on Pensacola Beach , part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore , which advertises `` the world 's whitest beaches , '' as the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history widened . Florida , the `` Sunshine State '' with a $ 60 billion annual tourism industry , had braced for oil from the 46-day-old spill to arrive . Oil had already hit the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama to the west . Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson told CNN the arrival of the oil signified `` a huge economic hit '' to local tourism . `` There are already cancellations , the restaurants are down a little bit , '' he said . Beachgoers on Pensacola Beach , many of them children , picked up rust-colored tar blobs , ranging in size from a button to a table-tennis ball , scattered along the sugar-white sands . `` It 's pretty sad because we go here on vacation every summer , and now we wo n't be able to go anymore . I just ca n't believe it , because it used to be all just white sand , '' one visitor , Grace Vondohlen , said . Buck Lee , director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority , said he could not be sure the oil came from the spill leaking from BP Plc 's undersea Gulf of Mexico well off Louisiana , `` but I 'm 90 percent certain that it is . '' The oil will be analyzed to confirm the link with the oil spill , the worst in U.S. history . Of all the states affected so far , Florida has the most to lose . Tourism is its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors a year , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million people . Investment analysts say that since Florida has no income tax and relies heavily on sales tax revenues , any fall-off in tourism could badly squeeze a state economy still bleeding from a housing market meltdown and the global recession . Nelson told CNN the economic impact of the spill on Gulf Coast states including Florida was `` already billions -LRB- of dollars -RRB- ... and if it goes all summer and you put that much oil in the Gulf , it 's going to be multiple billions of dollars of economic loss and damage . '' He added a flotilla of ships , including several Coast Guard cutters , were working 25 to 50 miles off northwest Florida , scooping up portions of oil . `` That 's the goal , to try to keep it away from the bays and estuaries and the beach . '' Near Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island , workers scooped up tar balls with shovels along the high-water line and put them into plastic bags . `` They 're working in an area that 's pretty sensitive and has tern nesting areas , '' National Park Services spokeswoman Katie Lawhon said . `` I think it 's horrible , '' said Anthony Cross , walking along Pensacola Beach with his three daughters , holding a child 's fishing net full of tar . `` You see shells and jellyfish and trash but I 've never seen oil here . It 's crazy , '' he added . Florida tourism authorities were rolling out an aggressive advertising campaign , partially funded by BP , aimed at stressing that the state 's beaches remain open for business , despite the pollution threat . Florida Governor Charlie Crist has asked BP executives for an additional $ 50 million to fight the encroaching oil , on top of $ 25 million already received from the company and spent . On Friday , Crist asked the British-based company for $ 100 million more to fund spill response efforts by the Florida Institute of Oceanography , a partnership of 21 universities and other marine science organizations . Florida tourism officials , promising `` 100 percent transparency , '' are using live video and Twitter feeds so visitors can check the situation of beaches before booking . `` We 're not going to sit here and say , ` The whole state of Florida is going to be shut down as a result of this , ' because that 's just not true , '' said Chris Thompson , who heads the state tourism marketing board . Many experts believe crude from the Gulf of Mexico spill has already been caught up in the powerful Loop Current curling around the Florida Peninsula , which could take it into the Florida Keys and possibly up the East Coast .

'' BP on Friday resisted pressure from some U.S. lawmakers to stop dividend payouts until the full cost of cleaning up the spill is known . The company is due to announce its second-quarter dividend and results on July 27 . The $ 10.5 billion figure quoted by Obama covers dividend payments for the whole year and not just for this quarter as he said . Obama was speaking on his third trip in a month to the oil-stained Louisiana coast . The six-week-old spill , the biggest in U.S. history , has caused environmental devastation and threatens the future of a multibillion-dollar fishing industry . Obama said it was too early to say whether BP 's latest attempt to control the spill , placing a containment cap over a gushing deep-sea oil well , would be successful , but it appeared to be working so far . The president has vowed to hold BP accountable for the disaster , saying it must pay the costs of capping the well and dealing with the massive oil spill . `` I do n't have a problem with BP fulfilling its legal obligations , but I want BP to be very clear they 've got moral and legal obligations here in the Gulf for the damage that has been done , '' he said . `` And what I do n't want to hear is , when they 're spending that kind of money on their shareholders and spending that kind of money on TV advertising , that they 're nickel and diming fishermen or small businesses here in the Gulf . '' Obama , who has been criticized for not showing enough emotion about the devastation hitting the Gulf region , raised his voice when talking about the London-based oil company . Obama spoke to reporters after meeting local officials , state governors and administration officials involved in overseeing the response to the spill . Officials at the meeting told Obama that Gulf residents and businesses were having trouble getting claims paid by BP . Some local fishermen and boat operators have also complained that the economic hardship payments paid by BP , ranging up to $ 5,000 a person , have been insufficient to make ends meet . The company said on Friday it would be paying a second month of loss-of-income claims to compensate for income and profit disruptions . BP , which says the spill has cost it about $ 1 billion so far , put off a decision on Friday on whether to suspend paying its next quarterly dividend . Most analysts believe the company can foot the bill without cutting its dividend . Obama has repeatedly lambasted BP over the spill , which has confronted him with one of the biggest challenges of his presidency . The White House announced early on Friday that Obama was postponing a June 13-19 trip to Indonesia and Australia so he could focus on the oil spill . There is growing public criticism of his administration 's handling of the disaster . More than 60 percent of Americans believe both Obama and BP are not doing enough to clean up the spill , according to a CBS News poll released on Friday . As Obama 's motorcade drove toward the coastal town of Grand Isle , a group of people stood in front of a house holding a cardboard sign that said : `` Help us now . '' In Grand Isle , Obama met with local residents who had been affected by the spill . The president , who was criticized for not meeting `` real people '' during his last visit to the region , peeled and ate shrimp while visiting with the local mayor , fishermen , a marina owner and a convenience store owner . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Has Obama lost his mind ?! Are we in coastal Louisiana now to hope for a `` big , powerful storm ?! Obama would prefer that New Orleans East be drowned under 20 foot of oil sludge instead of water ?! Obviously I was fooled into believing this man had more smarts than me . What an awful thought to convey amid one of the most critical events to hit our shores . Yes , an hurricane right now would undoubtedly churn up the crude and disperse it over an even larger area than we could possibly imagine , but it would break up .

British energy giant BP Plc said it collected 6,077 barrels -LRB- 255,000 gallons\\/966 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil per day from the well on Friday , and that `` improvement in oil collection is expected over the next several days . '' After soiling wetland wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama , the black tide of pollution has reached some of the famous white beaches of Florida . The toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals , including sea turtles and dolphins , is also climbing . But 47 days into the crisis and after several unsuccessful attempts at containment by BP , a partial solution finally appears at hand . The containment cap that BP clamped over the leak earlier this week was siphoning oil to a waiting drill-ship at a faster rate than initially estimated , U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said at a briefing in Theodore , Alabama . Bob Fryar , senior vice president with BP , later told a meeting of local mayors in Alabama that the latest undersea containment effort had gone `` extremely well '' so far . The collection rate is still only about one-third of one day 's flow from the oil geyser , which has been estimated by the government at about 19,000 barrels -LRB- 800,000 gallons\\/3 million liters -RRB- per day . But it could mark a turning point in the drama that has riveted the world and forced the Obama administration to reconsider plans to expand offshore oil drilling , which was seen as way to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil . Allen said the full capacity of BP 's containment device was about 15,000 bpd , the `` upper limit '' of the current leak control effort . BP does not expect to fully halt the oil flow until August , when two relief wells are due to be completed . He said that winds continue to push parts of the vast oil slick closer to the coastline across a wide area -- roughly from the Mississippi-Alabama border to Port St. Joe in the Florida Panhandle , or more than 200 miles . Florida 's fishermen got a glimmer of good news late on Friday when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reopened about 16,000 square miles -LRB- 41,400 sq km -RRB- that had been closed to fishing on June 2 as a precaution . Still , fully one-third of Gulf federal waters , or 78,603 square miles -LRB- 203,582 sq km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing in waters off four states . The U.S. shrimp and oyster supply , in particular , is heavily concentrated in the Gulf . In his weekly radio address on Saturday , Obama defended his administration against charges it had not moved aggressively enough in its response to the worst oil spill in U.S. history , which followed an April 20 rig blast that killed 11 workers . Obama , who made a third trip to the Gulf coast on Friday , said he has put in place the largest response to an environmental disaster in U.S. history . The government had been `` mobilized on every front , '' he said . Meanwhile , BP said it had no specific pre-allocated budget to pay damages claims resulting from the spill , but will pay all those `` hurt , harmed or damaged '' until all legitimate claims are satisfied , `` We will make these payments for as long as it takes ... There is no budget , we 'll do this until it 's finished , '' BP America Vice President of Resources Darryl Willis said in a conference call from Orange Beach , Alabama . The company faces a U.S. criminal probe , several lawsuits , dwindling investor confidence and growing questions about its credit-worthiness . Its share price has been stripped of about one-third of its value since the crisis began . BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward has insisted the company had plenty of money to meet its obligations , including $ 5 billion in cash and additional credit lines it could tap . The company has said it had already spent $ 1 billion on the disaster . It is preparing to send a second advance payment to individuals and businesses along the Gulf Coast to compensate for the loss of income as a result of the spill . About 14,000 individuals and businesses will have received about $ 84 million once the second payment is processed . The company delayed a decision on Friday to suspend its quarterly dividend payments , as some U.S. politicians have demanded . The far-flung but fragmented oil slick appeared to make its first landfall in Florida on Friday as tar balls and an oily sheen washed up on Pensacola Beach on the Panhandle . Tar ball sightings were fewer on Saturday , but residents and environmental officials were still uneasy . `` BP ca n't stop it , I do n't think the Navy or the military can stop it , '' said local businessman Michael Penzone . `` If we can get people to come out and start praying , maybe something good can come out of this . '' Local officials are bracing for more impact from the spill on Florida 's $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry . Protesters planned an anti-BP rally for Sunday at a BP gas station in downtown Pensacola -- although such grass-roots actions are mostly seen as damaging to small business owners who run the stations . In Orange Beach on Alabama 's Gulf shore , BP 's Fryar faced anger from local mayors about what was termed the company 's sluggish response to oil clean-up on local beaches . `` We just climbed out of a hole , from two hurricanes and two years of recession . This was going to be a banner year , and BP killed it , '' said Tony Kennon , mayor of Orange Beach , just west of the Florida border . Latest figures from the U.S. government on Friday showed 527 birds across the Gulf Coast have been collected dead over a 45-day period , although not all showed signs of oil . Tom Bancroft , chief scientist for the National Audubon Society , said the government 's numbers tell only part of the story . `` Some -LRB- birds -RRB- just sink under the water and will never be counted , '' he said . Of particular concern , Bancroft said , are threatened shore birds that breed on Gulf Coast beaches . The spill could also be `` a really bad setback '' for the brown pelican , Louisiana 's state bird , which was only removed from the endangered species list in 2009 . NOAA also reported many heavily oiled sea turtles in the spill zone . The turtles are being caught , cleaned and transported to an Audubon Aquarium outside New Orleans for further care . Dozens of dead dolphins have also been stranded within the spill area since late April . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It doesnt look like its collecting anything ! www.deepwaterbp.com @dara , the article says they 're collecting only 5 % of the oil so far . That means they 're NOT collecting 95 % of the oil . For some reason this President only seems comfortable when he can threaten those who he sees as a problem , whether that problem is intentional or not . It may hearken back to his days in Chicago politics , or just the defensive instincts of a man lacking the maturity of age and development . Regardless of the reason , he stands tall when there is credit to be taken and points fingers in all directions when there is a lack of adoration . He lacks statesmanship and can not even comprehend that as a fact ... he could not recognize it if it confronted him in a narrow hallway .

The progress came as the company 's Chief Executive Tony Hayward said he has no plans to quit over his handling of the environmental disaster marked by a string of failures since the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the oil spill . Thad Allen , the Coast Guard admiral heading up the federal relief effort , estimated the maximum collection from the containment device at about 15,000 barrels a day . Estimates put the well 's leak at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day . Despite the progress , Allen told CBS 's `` Face the Nation '' program : `` This will only end when we intercept the wellbore , pump mud down it to overcome the pressure of the oil coming up from the reservoir and put a cement plug in ... '' `` This will be well into the fall , '' he said . `` This is a siege across the entire Gulf . This spill is holding everybody hostage , not only economically but physically , and it has to be attacked on all fronts . '' For many in Florida , the man-made environmental disaster is just the latest in a series of disastrous events to befall panhandle residents , from hurricanes to the housing bust . '' -LRB- Hurricane -RRB- Ivan took my roof off , the housing market took my business and my house and now this is hampering my comeback , '' said Bill Paul , who has scrapped plans to open a restaurant and was protesting at a BP station in Pensacola . Pressure has mounted on London-based BP to stop the leak from the ruined seabed well and bear the cost of the cleanup and damage caused to coastal fisheries , wildlife and tourism . Hayward became a lightning rod for Americans ' anger with BP when he told struggling Gulf Coast residents last month , `` I would like my life back , '' a remark widely seen as insensitive . `` It has n't crossed my mind , '' Hayward when asked by The Sunday Telegraph if he might resign because of the spill . `` It 's clearly crossed other people 's minds but not mine . '' Hayward told the BBC he had the full support of BP 's board and the company 's balance sheet was strong , despite the plunge in the company 's market value as a result of the disaster . `` BP is ... generating a lot of cash . It will generate $ 30 to $ 35 billion of free cash flow this year ... We have the financial strength to see through this , '' he told the BBC . `` We have a further containment system to implement in the course of this coming week which will be in place by next weekend , '' Hayward told the BBC . `` When these two are in place we ... hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil . '' The Obama administration has delayed plans to increase offshore drilling as a result of the spill . The crisis has put President Barack Obama on the defensive and distracted his team from their domestic agenda -- a new energy policy , reform of Wall Street and bolstering a struggling American economy . The focus on America 's biggest environmental disaster comes ahead of November 's congressional elections in which the Democrats are expected to struggle to keep their majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate . Obama wants to tap into public anger over images of polluted beaches and fishing grounds to press for faster development of alternative energy such as solar and wind power , which was already on his agenda . On Sunday , Senator John Kerry said lawmakers and Obama should now push that policy forward . `` I am convinced you 're going to see the Congress of the United States and the -LRB- Obama -RRB- administration together hold BP ... accountable , '' Kerry , a Democrat , told ABC 's `` This Week . '' Kerry said America needs Congress to agree to a comprehensive energy policy that would cut pollution , be better for national security and create millions of jobs . `` Here 's what 's important -- not to be throwing the blame around , but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil , '' Kerry said . In a speech last week at Carnegie Mellon University , Obama said the spill showed the United States can not continue to depend so heavily on fossil fuels . He said offshore drilling was only a short-term solution to America 's energy needs . But Senator John Cornyn said Republicans oppose a broad energy bill . `` Rather than try to hit a grand slam home run , I 'd like to work with Senator Kerry and others to hit some singles and develop nuclear power , battery technology that will help us deal with our environmental concerns , '' he said on ABC . Oil began leaking from the well after the rig explosion that killed 11 workers . BP faces a criminal investigation , lawsuits , dwindling investor confidence and questions about its credit-worthiness . Its shares have lost about one-third of their value since the crisis began . BP said it has spent $ 1 billion on the spill and vowed to pay all legitimate claims of those harmed by the disaster . After contaminating wetland wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama , the black tide of crude oil has taken aim at some of the famous white beaches of Florida , whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism . Florida Governor Charlie Crist told CNN the oil debris washing up on Panhandle beaches was relatively easy to clean up because it was landing on the famous sugar-white beaches instead of in marshes or estuaries , as in Louisiana . Ron Gillette , a Pensacola medical supplies salesman , has been surfing in recent days and said that while little oil was in evidence in the water , `` We can smell it . It stinks bad . '' Tourism is Florida 's largest industry , employing nearly 1 million people . And some businesses are already suffering . `` It 's already affected our business , '' said Yancy Spencer , owner of the Innerlight Surf Shop in Gulf Breeze , the neighboring town to Pensacola Beach . `` We own rental places too and we 've had people canceling their week here . '' Fully one-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,603 square miles -LRB- 202,582 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals , including sea turtles and dolphins , is climbing . In Louisiana 's Four Bayou Pass , which separates Barataria Pass from the Gulf of Mexico , wildlife rescue workers hired by BP were dressed in white protective suits as they searched by boat from island to island for oiled birds . The absorbent boom around one mangrove island , teeming with pelicans with nests and chicks , was covered in crude , stained orange and dark brown . Oiled birds were visible behind the soiled boom . Concerned about the damage to tourism , Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that his state 's beaches have only a few tar balls . `` The coast is clear , come on down , '' he said .

Full Article Norway to apply BP oil spill lessons to Arctic Credit : Reuters\\/Ann Marie Gorden\\/U . S Coast Guard photo\\/Handout By Alister Doyle , Environment Correspondent OSLO | Mon Jun 7 , 2010 10:40 pm IST OSLO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Norway will apply lessons learned in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in its approach to opening new hydrocarbon exploration zones in the Arctic region , the country 's prime minister said on Monday . Europe 's second-largest energy supplier is considering whether to open up the Lofoten islands , as well as other areas in its Arctic North , to oil firms such as state-owned Statoil . `` We will take into consideration all knowledge , all experiences , also the experience from the recent accident in the Gulf of Mexico , '' Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg told Reuters . The PM did not say whether new regulations were under consideration . Companies are eyeing opportunities to tap Arctic oil reserves made more accessible by climate change . But the disaster at a ruptured BP oil well has refocused attention on environmental risks . Green groups argue that the seas off the Lofoten islands should be closed to oil majors as they have unique cold water reefs and are home to the spawning grounds of the world 's largest cod stock . They argue that other areas in Norway 's Arctic zone should also remain off-limits to industry , as companies would struggle to clean up any oil spills due to winter darkness and a lack of nearby port facilities to bring in booms and skimmers . That remoteness and high costs already make many analysts doubt a big `` cold rush '' is imminent . Oil companies , however , want new areas to be open as Norway 's North Sea oil production is declining and the industry needs new acreage for exploration . '' -LRB- After -RRB- 2020 , it would not be possible -LRB- to maintain current production -RRB- if we are not opening new areas and making significantly larger discoveries than we do today , '' Oeystein Michelsen , Statoil 's head of exploration and production in Norway , told Reuters on Thursday . Statoil acknowledged that the Deepwater Horizon accident was making it more difficult to open up the Lofoten to oil exploration . `` I would not anticipate that -LRB- the spill -RRB- has brought the debate on Lofoten in the right direction , '' Michelsen said .

The well is leaking crude at a rate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day despite a number of attempts by BP to cap it , polluting wildlife refuges in Louisiana , barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama and some of Florida 's famous beaches . While officials in a command center in BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston work on halting the subsea flow of oil , an even bigger team near Houma , Louisiana , is dealing with the spill on the water 's surface and overseeing shoreline cleanup operations for Louisiana , the state hardest hit by the spill . Other BP command centers in Mississippi , Alabama and Florida manage the shoreline response in those states . Up to 1,000 people , including military personnel , BP officials and scientists , work at the center in Houma in a building that is normally a BP training center for offshore engineers . Operations are conducted during daylight hours . Every hotel room in Houma and the surrounding area has been booked for an indefinite period to accommodate the workers . A free dry-cleaning service has been added , while the building 's kitchen - which was designed to cook breakfast and lunch for 50 to 75 people -- has been beefed up to turn out free meals 24 hours a day . `` We 've got the best food -LRB- of all the command centers -RRB- , '' Mike Utsler , the incident commander and effective head of the center in Houma , told Reuters during a recent visit . The emphasis on food is a deliberate strategy to keep morale high . Some staff came onboard expecting a shorter haul but they no longer know how long they will be away from home . `` We 'll rotate out for a few days -LRB- every two weeks -RRB- until it 's over , '' said Barbara Callahan of the International Bird Rescue Research Center . Some personnel work 14 days on , 14 days off , but others have much shorter breaks . Utsler has not had a day off since he flew down from Alaska 38 days ago . The command centers are a collaborative effort among BP , the state government , the Coast Guard and government agencies and under the control of Washington 's point man on the crisis , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen . BP occupies most of the senior roles . In addition to Utsler , most of the division heads are BP executives . Their deputies come from the Coast Guard , safety regulator OSHA , the U.S. Minerals Management Service or other government bodies . Last week , BP placed a containment cap on the well in an attempt to capture the flowing oil at source and bring it to ships on the surface . But the company still faces public anger and mounting political pressure over its efforts . Some politicians are unhappy with BP 's leadership role in containing the spill and hint the company 's obligations to its shareholders may color its judgments , a suggestion rejected by Utsler . `` Our focus is on the mission , '' he said . The heart of the operation is the main control room , which has long rows of desks cluttered with laptop computers . Large flat-screen televisions , blown-up photographs , maps and projection screens cover the walls . Teams of experts in oil burning , the spraying of dispersants , and oil skimming , sit in clusters alongside teams of legal and financial specialists . BAD INDUSTRY PRACTICES MEANS MUCH CLEANUP PRACTICE The Houma Command Center 's first priority is to keep the oil slick , which it refers to as `` the blob , '' off the shore by skimming , burning or capturing it with absorbent booms . When it hits land , or affects wildlife , the relevant units kick into gear . The relative frequency of spills around U.S. coastlines means the response effort has been able to draw from a rich seam of experience . `` I 've worked on 50 to 60 oil spills since 1996 , mostly in California , '' said Michael Ziccardi , associate professor of clinical wildlife health at the University of California Davis . Houston-based Rhonda Murgatroyd , a specialist in treating oiled birds , said , `` I spend a lot of my time in Louisiana and Texas ... but on a much smaller scale . '' So far , relatively few animals have been oiled , said Ziccardi , who has responsibility for sea mammals and turtles . But he is not complacent . `` We 're prepared for oiled manatees , '' he said . When it comes to cleaning up the shore itself , decades of oil spills have taught some counter-intuitive lessons , namely that doing nothing is sometimes the best thing -- especially in the case of marshlands -- as cleanup efforts can do more damage than the oil itself . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . No wonder BP refuses to tell -- each barrel is worth royalty money it owes , so the lower the figure BP says is flowing into the Gulf of Mexico , the lower its liability to the American taxpayer . What a cheap and corrupt company BP is . After the blowout is plugged and it pays the local economy business losses and the cleanup costs , the company should be sued for royalties as well as being sued for any failings leading to the disaster . You really believe Obama s true intent is to distribute BP s dividends to the people who have been effected by this environmental catastrophe ? More like his true intent is to make sure Wall Street profits handsomely ! It has been leaked out to foreign news that Haliburton had intentionally damaged the oil pipe , but Obama and BP has done everything they can to cover this up . Since the day he took office he has extended Bush s radical bills but put it on steroids , or created more new radical bills and has lied to the Americans with a straight face .

Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who leads the government 's relief effort , said London-based BP hoped to collect 20,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- per day in its latest effort to contain the worst spill in U.S. history , which has now affected 120 miles of coastline . The figure underscored some scientists ' concerns that the May 27 government estimate of up to 19,000 barrels coming daily from the well a mile under the sea may be too low . BP had estimated the flow at just 5,000 barrels a day . Neither Allen nor BP gave an estimate of how much oil is still flowing into the Gulf . The 49-day-old spill is causing an ecological and economic disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast , and testing Barack Obama 's presidency . BP 's latest effort to contain the gushing oil is the first positive sign after a series of failed attempts fueled public anger at the company . The earlier efforts generated initial optimism that an end to the crisis was in sight , but those hopes were dashed when the crude kept spewing out . Allen said BP 's latest attempt -- placing a containment cap on top of the gushing pipe on the ocean floor -- appeared to be going `` fairly well . '' Allen said cleaning up the oil spill will take at least four to six weeks after the well is eventually sealed -- expected to be in August . But dealing with the long-term environmental effects will take years , he said . `` We 're no longer dealing with a large , monolithic spill . We 're dealing with an aggregation of hundreds of thousands of patches of oil that are going a lot of different directions , '' Allen said , stressing the broad dispersal of the oil . `` Dealing with the oil spill on the surface is going to go on for a couple of months '' once the well is plugged , Allen said . `` Long-term issues of restoring the environment and the habitats ... will be years . '' Obama said after meeting with Cabinet officials at the White House that the economic impact of the spill , which threatens the Gulf Coast 's multibillion-dollar fishing industry , will be substantial . He said the U.S. government would `` ride herd '' on BP to make sure that it paid damage claims from Gulf Coast residents , who have complained that the company is not paying them promptly . He was also pushing BP to be prepared for a possible hurricane in the Gulf . The Atlantic hurricane season , which is forecast to be unusually active this year , began last week , typically peaks in August and ends in November . BP said it was preparing a system that , in case of a hurricane approaching , would allow the drillship collecting the oil to disconnect from a pipe that floats up to about 300 feet below the water 's surface and get out of the storm 's path . It is expected to be operational by early July . BP shares , which have lost about a third of their value since the crisis began , closed slightly lower in London trading . In New York , BP 's American depositary shares closed down 1.1 percent . `` With the right LMRP -LRB- containment cap -RRB- efficiency and surface skimming response , we may have turned the corner on shoreline oil spill volumes , '' analysts at Credit Suisse said in a research note . But there were still signs of investor skepticism . Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on BP to `` neutral '' from `` buy , '' saying the spill would impact the London-based company 's ability to do business worldwide , while Nordic bank Nordea said it had divested all its BP shares , worth about 10 million euros -LRB- $ 12 million -RRB- from its funds . Containing the spill is a critical test for BP and Obama . Images of birds struggling through oil-soaked waters ringing Louisiana 's ecologically fragile barrier islands and marshes have added to the pressure on Obama , who already faces growing public criticism over his handling of the crisis . A new Washington Post\\/ABC poll found that 69 percent of Americans believe the government had done a `` not so good '' or `` poor '' job handling the spill . Just over 1,000 people were surveyed in the poll , conducted between June 3 and 6 . The new BP effort involves placing a containment cap with a seal on remnants of a pipe at the deep-sea wellhead . Oil is channeled to a ship for later processing at a refinery ashore . BP said it collected 10,500 barrels of oil on Saturday and 11,100 barrels on Sunday , with 27,700 barrels of oil collected between June 3 , when the operation began , and June 6 . `` We still do n't know what the flow rate is . That 's the big unknown right now , '' Allen said . One high-end estimate by a U.S. government expert panel puts the leak at 25,000 barrels -LRB- 1.05 million gallons\\/3 .97 million liters -RRB- a day . Allen said BP would send a second rig to the spill site to help capture the oil `` and the combination of these two ... will have a production capability of about 20,000 barrels a day . '' `` Our aim is to capture all the oil , whatever that volume is , '' a BP spokesman said in response to Allen 's statement , without confirming the figure given by the admiral . A live video feed of the seabed leak shows black crude still billowing into the sea . BP and government officials have said a definitive solution will not come until August when a relief well is drilled . This is intended to intersect the leaking well and allow it to be sealed . After contaminating wetland wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama , oil has begun to hit some of the famous white beaches of Florida , where the $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry accounts for nearly 1 million jobs . As clean-up crews raked up oil debris and oiled seaweed on Pensacola Beach in the northwest Florida Panhandle , visitors seemed undeterred by the pollution threat . `` It 's an awful crisis but we 're really not going to let it ruin our vacation , '' said Jennifer Blow from New Orleans . One-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Do n't become BP 's Collateral Damaged , like Exxon s Collateral Damaged . My name is Merle Savage , a female general foreman during the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- beach cleanup in 1989 . I am one of the 11,000 + cleanup workers from the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- , who is suffering from health issues from that toxic cleanup , without compensation from Exxon . Dr. Riki Ott visited me in 2007 to explain about the toxic spraying on the beaches . She also informed me that Exxon 's medical records and the reports that surfaced in litigation by sick workers in 1994 , had been sealed from the public , making it impossible to hold Exxon responsible for their actions . Exxon developed the toxic spraying ; OSHA , the Coast Guard , and the state of Alaska authorized the procedure . Beach crews breathed in crude oil that splashed off the rocks and into the air -- the toxic exposure turned into chronic breathing conditions and central nervous system problems , neurological impairment , chronic respiratory disease , leukemia , lymphoma , brain tumors , liver damage , and blood disease . My web site is devoted to searching for EVOS cleanup workers who were exposed to the toxic spraying , and are suffering from the same illnesses that I have . There is an on going Longshoreman s claim for workers with medical problems from the oil cleanup . Our summer employment turned into a death sentence for many -- and a life of unending medical conditions for the rest of Exxon s Collateral Damaged . The new system they are talking about is most likely connecting flow pipe to to the surface from the two valves low on the BOP they used for pumping for days trying a `` top kill '' . That should get another few thousand barrels a day flow and hopefully reduce the leak some to the ocean from the poor seal method they used with the big rubber gasket . Rubber gaskets are for garden hoses . Lead or some maleable metal is better for 10,000 psi plus using a compression clamp to squeeze the pipes together and against the lead gasket or liner . The idea is shown here but any variation of a a compression clamp with a soft metal gasket will work . Evidence seems convincing that the public has been deceived for way too long on the actual amount of leakage from the blown out well , both before the riser pipe was sawed off , and since then . The latest news is that the diversion to the top is maxed out now , around 15,000 barrels , per day . However , what if the amount of leakage is double , triple or even more . The oil companies are drilling all the time and know what is the amount of oil coming out naturally from their wells . Why is this one any different ? Not only the oil companies but , the USA Govt should be able to nail down much more exactly the amount of oil being emitted . Fox News today announced that the Govt has been holding back a revised and more honest report , where the oil blowout is way over 30,000 barrels . First , look at the widespread oil slick and miles of beach now affected , indicating strongly after all that the spill has been super big from day one . This is even after all of the burning , cleanup , natural eradication by sea bacteria , skimming and all else being done to remove oil from the sea and beaches . It is one thing for BP to lie to America , but our own Govt hiding the truth ? That is just inexcusable and constitutes grounds for job firing of any Govt officials that have engaged in such cover up . If Obama has known the truth of the amount of oil spill , but has covered it up , that means impeachment time for him as a supreme act of dishonesty to the American people .

The London-based company 's share price closed down 5 percent in London after U.S. President Barack Obama said he wanted to know `` whose ass to kick '' over the massive spill . The on-going disaster remains at the top of Obama 's crowded domestic agenda , a point underscored by his strong comments and Tuesday 's announcement that he will head back to the Gulf coast next week to inspect efforts to contain the spill . Obama will visit Mississippi , Alabama and Florida during a two-day trip beginning on Monday , the White House said . BP already faces a criminal investigation and lawsuits over the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers and triggered the 50-day-old oil spill , the worst in U.S. history . Efforts to contain the mess forged ahead . BP said on Tuesday it had collected 14,800 barrels of oil from the leaking well on Monday , 33 percent higher than the amount collected on Sunday and the highest capture rate since it installed a new system last week to contain the spill . BP later said it collected 7,850 barrels of oil in the 12-hour stretch ended at noon CDT -LRB- 1700 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday . That brought the total collected since the cap was installed to 51,364 barrels . Hoping to calm rising passions , BP said it would donate revenues from the oil it is recovering to restore Gulf wildlife habitats . The company had already committed itself to cleaning up after the disaster . The political heat remains intense as the disaster spills over into energy policy in Washington . The Interior Department issued new safety and environmental requirements for companies that want to drill in shallow waters . They have until June 28 to show they have met the new requirements or face being shut down . BP chief executive Tony Hayward was called to testify , for the first time , at a congressional hearing on June 17 that will focus on the company 's role in the rig explosion and subsequent spill . BP said he would attend . Another congressional committee investigating the spill sent a letter to rig operator Transocean that questioned whether the company had enough people working on Deepwater Horizon at the time of the explosion . After the spill , the Obama administration imposed a six-month moratorium on new drilling permits for exploration and development wells in waters deeper than 500 feet . U.S. officials also refused to approve new drilling in shallow waters until new rules were issued . Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup effort , said on Monday neither BP nor the government knew just how much oil was gushing out of the well . `` That 's the big unknown right now , '' he said . BP has given conservative estimates of the oil flow that have been ridiculed by scientists and U.S. lawmakers . Even the government 's much higher estimates of 12,000-19 ,000 barrels a day seemed on the low side after Allen said the company planned to double its collection of oil from the well to 20,000 barrels every day -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- . Allen said on Tuesday U.S. scientists would present revised estimates later this week or early next week . The panel of experts has said BP 's latest effort to contain the oil spill could actually increase the flow rate by up to 20 percent . BP and government officials have said a definitive solution will not come until August when a relief well is drilled . Obama , who faces growing criticism that he has appeared detached from the economic and ecological catastrophe hitting four U.S. Gulf states , sharpened his criticism of BP in an interview with NBC 's `` Today '' show that aired on Tuesday . Obama said he was talking to experts to find out what had gone wrong `` so I know whose ass to kick '' over the spill , which has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline and threatens the Gulf Coast 's lucrative fishing industry . Fadel Gheit , an analyst at Oppenheimer and Co , said it was `` not a coincidence '' that BP 's shares were down after Obama 's comments increased pressure on the company to fix the mess . In New York , BP 's American depositary shares fell more than 5 percent , mirroring the losses in earlier London trading . Transocean shares also tumbled in New York , trading to their lowest in 18 months , as the market worried about the company 's liability for the oil disaster . BP shares have lost about a third of their value since the crisis erupted . Investors are worried about the size of the final bill for the spill , expected to be in the billions . The company has already spent more than $ 1 billion on cleaning up the slick , which has fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama and also sent tar balls ashore on beaches in Florida . One-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . U.S. weather forecasters gave their first confirmation on Tuesday that some of the oil leaking from BP 's well has lingered beneath the surface rather than rising to the top . Undersea oil depletes the water 's oxygen content and threatens marine life like mussels , clams , crabs , eels and shrimp . In Fort Jackson in southern Louisiana , the New Orleans Saints , winners of the National Football League 's Superbowl in February , held a rally to help lift the spirits of communities reeling from the spill . `` I came out to support the Saints and to try and get my mind off the oil spill . This team has meant everything to the state of Louisiana , '' said local homemaker Laura Bartholomew . Hundreds of fans , many wearing black and gold jerseys , braved scorching temperatures to attend the rally . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . We ca n't expect anything else from them other than trying to maximize profits at all costs . It 's our government that has let us down . Lack of regulation and the cozy relationship with the oil industry and their money has lead us to this moment . Now that the White House is being deluged with emails urging him to show something , he 's coming out acting tough . Too little too late , my man . You have lost our trust and will need to earn it back . Pass comprehensive campaign reform . We vote for them and then they listen to the lobbyists and not us . Stop playing politics and start leading . Or else the Republicans will be back in power with their insane `` we do n't need government '' bull crap . Why spend this much time coming up with solutions to produce the well ? If the cement job is holding and the 9-5\\/8 ? seal assembly is\\/was working . . why not disconnect the BOP at the wellhead connector ... raise the stack ... cut the drill pipe fish with shears they used on the riser ... and skid a new stack in place -LRB- with blind rams in each cavity -RRB- ... reconnect to the wellhead and close the rams .

In an interview with NBC News ' `` Today '' aired on Tuesday , Obama also said that if BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward worked for him , he would have fired him by now over his response to the 50-day-old spill , the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . It was triggered by an April 20 well blowout and rig explosion that killed 11 workers . The U.S. president , who himself faces growing criticism that his administration was slow to react to the economic and ecological catastrophe hitting four U.S. Gulf states , said he did not want to prejudge the investigation into the incident . `` But the initial reports indicate there may be situations in which not only human error was involved , but you also saw some corner cutting in terms of safety , '' Obama said in some of his angriest public words yet about the catastrophe . Hayward says a `` series of failures '' led to the accident but denies these resulted from BP efforts to save costs . Responding to critics who say his response to the spill should be more engaged and forceful , Obama said : `` I was down there a month ago , before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf . '' `` And I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar ; we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers , so I know whose ass to kick , '' he added . In London , BP 's share price was down more than 2 percent after Obama 's remarks . BP shares have lost about a third of their value since the crisis erupted , and the company suffered another blow when Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on BP to `` neutral '' from `` buy '' this week . The stakes are high for Obama too . A Washington Post\\/ABC poll found that 69 percent of Americans believe the government had done a `` not so good '' or `` poor '' job handling the spill . Just over 1,000 people were surveyed in the poll , conducted between June 3 and 6 . The spill has affected 120 miles of coastline , fouling wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama and also sending tar balls ashore on northwest beaches of Florida , where the $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry accounts for nearly 1 million jobs . The Obama administration has imposed a six-month moratorium on new drilling permits for exploration and development wells in waters deeper than 500 feet . But the U.S. Interior Department may issue new safety and environmental requirements as soon as Tuesday for companies that want to drill in shallow waters . The Gulf of Mexico incident has also started to have international ramifications . Britain said it would increase its inspection of North Sea drilling rigs and monitoring of offshore practices in light of the Gulf of Mexico spill . The International Energy Agency said it may cut its oil output estimates for the Gulf of Mexico by up to 300,000 barrels a day for 2015 on potentially tighter U.S. laws on deepwater drilling after the BP well accident . While a complete halt to the flow of oil is not expected until August at the earliest , BP has reported an increase in the amount of oil it is capturing from the well in its latest containment effort . Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who leads the government 's relief effort , said on Monday that London-based BP hoped to collect 20,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- per day in its latest effort . BP said it had collected 7,541 barrels of oil in the first 12 hours of Monday . If it collected the same amount the rest of the day , the total for Monday would be more than 15,000 barrels , about 35 percent higher than the amount collected on Sunday . Neither Allen nor BP gave an estimate of how much oil is still flowing into the Gulf . BP 's latest attempt involves placing a containment cap on top of the gushing pipe on the ocean floor . Away from the action in the Gulf , the political heat remains intense in Washington with yet another congressional hearing set to bring BP and its peers under renewed scrutiny . The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing at 10:00 EDT -LRB- 1400 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday titled : `` The Risky Business of Big Oil : Have Recent Court Decisions and Liability Caps Encouraged Irresponsible Corporate Behavior ? '' Democrats in Congress have been looking at lifting such caps . CALLS FOR PUNISHMENT OF COMPANIES The Senate hearing follows one in Chalmette , Louisiana , where two women who lost their husbands in the explosion that unleashed the crisis urged members of Congress to hold BP accountable . `` I am asking you to please consider harsh punishments on companies who choose to ignore safety standards before other families are destroyed , '' said Courtney Kemp , whose husband , Wyatt , was killed in the explosion . The gravity of the spill was spelled out by Admiral Allen , who said its environmental consequences could last for years . `` Dealing with the oil spill on the surface is going to go on for a couple of months '' once the well is plugged , he said . `` Long-term issues of restoring the environment and the habitats ... will be years . '' Images of birds struggling through oil-soaked waters ringing Louisiana 's ecologically fragile barrier islands and marshes have added to the public outcry and pressure on Obama . One-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing .

N -RRB- -LRB- BP . L -RRB- shares tumbled nearly 16 percent on U.S. exchanges to a 14-year low on Wednesday on rising fears about how the wounded company will cope with the massive costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster . The stock has now lost more than half its value since the April 20 explosion that sank a BP-contracted rig and led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history . A steady flow of worsening news about the damage to the Gulf Coast environment and BP 's reputation , along with the potential liability and political fallout , has cast doubt on the British company 's ability to shoulder the burden . The dramatic sell-off on Wednesday added grist to the mill for corporate restructuring experts wondering about BP 's long-term viability , while other analysts pointed to an evaporation of investors ' patience . `` The confidence in BP being able to stop the oil leak and deal with the ecological aftermath has disappeared , '' said Joe Kinahan , chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade . Concerns about BP having to halt its dividend contributed to the selling , and the U.S. Justice Department said late on Wednesday it was concerned about planned payouts from BP and Transocean Ltd RIGN . S , owner of the lost rig . In the past two days alone , seven analysts have cut their expectations on the likely payout from BP . BP believes it may be heading for a showdown with the U.S. government over ever-increasing demands to cover the costs of the spill , according to a company source . `` The United States ' government is very mad at BP , '' said Jon Burnham , head of Burnham Securities , who sold his BP shares on Monday . `` They are now in the position of appearing to buck the president , and I do n't think the market likes that much . '' BP 's New York-traded shares headed sharply lower at about 1:30 p.m. EDT -LRB- 1730 GMT -RRB- , after an article appeared on Fortune magazine 's website quoting high-profile oil analyst Matthew Simmons , who raised questions about the company 's liability for the oil spill and its ability to survive the crisis . BP 's depositary shares closed at $ 29.20 , down $ 5.46 on the New York Stock Exchange , the lowest closing level since August 14 , 1996 . Earlier , the company 's stock fell 4 percent in London trading . `` I still feel like they can , but there 's more doubt in my mind than there was a week ago , '' Weiss said . `` Momentum is a powerful thing . '' The company had said on a conference call with analysts on Friday that it has `` plenty '' of cash to deal with the problem , and the Obama administration has made similar comments as the company grapples with clean-up in the Gulf . A BP spokesman said `` nothing has changed '' since Friday . Restructuring experts agreed that by running the numbers alone , BP looked like it could handle the financial damage . Brad Sandler , a bankruptcy attorney with Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones in Wilmington , Delaware , said the likelihood of a BP bankruptcy was `` probably remote '' because of its access to credit , solid cash flow and a healthy balance sheet . BP reported about $ 27 billion of cash flow from operations in 2009 and total liabilities amounted to about 56 percent of total assets on its balance sheet of about $ 235 billion . Stephen Lubben , a law professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark , New Jersey , added that the potentially massive liability bill was not large relative to BP 's size . `` You could add $ 50 billion of debt to their balance sheet and they would still be solvent , from an accounting perspective , '' he said . But Lubben noted that situation could change depending on whether creditors and banks get nervous and cut off BP 's access to funds , even if there was no sign of that now . Investors who bet on such events are already eyeing that possibility . BP Plc 's debt protection costs leaped 106 basis points on Wednesday to 368 basis points , or $ 368,000 per year to insure $ 10 million in debt for five years , according to Markit Intraday . Option-implied volatility for BP hit an all-time high , as traders brace for the likelihood for more downside in the stock price in the months to come , said Jon Najarian , a founder of Web information site optionMonster.com in Chicago . `` It is not just a rumor about the potential of a dividend cut in BP anymore , '' Najarian said . `` Now it 's about the survivability of the company .

President Barack Obama 's administration , getting tough as polls show public disapproval over its handling of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , threatened to impose new penalties on the company . BP depositary shares trading in New York fell nearly 16 percent to close at $ 29.20 , their lowest level since August 1996 , on growing worries about the costs the company will have to assume . BP said last week it has `` plenty of '' cash to deal with the problem and the Obama administration has made similar comments . A BP spokesman said `` nothing has changed '' since Friday and restructuring experts agreed that by running the numbers alone , BP looked able to handle the financial damage . But such confidence was not evident in the market . `` It seems that shares are under pressure from the fear of whether BP can survive . It is not just a rumor about the potential of a dividend cut in BP anymore . Now it 's about the survivability of the company , '' said Jon Najarian , a founder of Web information site optionMonster.com in Chicago . U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told a Senate hearing he would ask the British oil major to repay the salaries of any workers laid off because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater exploratory drilling imposed by the U.S. government after the spill . Turning up the heat on the beleaguered company , a senior U.S. Justice Department official said after the markets closed that the department was `` planning to take action '' to ensure BP had enough money on hand to cover damages from the spill . BP 's total bill so far , including cleanup costs , has reached $ 1.25 billion and the U.S. government has already said it will have to pay billions more in penalties . The White House echoed Salazar 's comments . `` The moratorium is as a result of the accident that BP caused . It is an economic loss for those workers , and ... those are claims that BP should pay , '' White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told a briefing . BP believes it may be heading for a showdown with the White House over widening liability demands , a BP source said . While the company has said it will pay for the clean-up and direct damages to those affected by the spill , the moratorium was a government decision and costs related to it were a different matter , the source said . Earlier , the company 's stock closed down 4 percent in London on concerns the company might have to suspend its dividend payment . U.S. politicians have been calling for this , saying the company should put its cash into paying for legal claims and environmental damage in the Gulf . At a congressional hearing on Wednesday , one lawmaker asked U.S. Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli whether the Justice Department had the ability to issue an injunction against BP to stop it paying its dividend . `` We are looking very closely at this and we are planning to take action , '' he said . With Wednesday 's share price drop in New York , BP has given up more than half its market value since the crisis began . `` The confidence in BP being able to stop the oil leak and deal with the ecological aftermath has disappeared , '' said TD Ameritrade chief derivatives strategist Joe Kinahan . Illustrating analysts ' anxiety about BP 's dividend , in the past two days alone , seven have cut their expectations on the likely payout . The cost of protecting BP 's debt against default hit new highs on Wednesday . The spill began on April 20 after an oil rig exploded , killing 11 workers and rupturing the deep-sea well . It has caused environmental devastation along the U.S. Gulf Coast and threatens lucrative fishing and tourist industries . The Obama administration , facing growing voter discontent over its own handling of the crisis , has sought to distance itself from the company . Obama has also toughened his rhetoric in recent days and said in an interview this week he would fire BP CEO Tony Hayward if he worked for him . In a further sign of the administration 's pressure on BP , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who is leading the government relief effort , demanded that the company provide more information and transparency on how it was meeting damages claims by individuals and businesses affected by the spill . `` The federal government and the public expects BP 's claims process to fully address the needs of impacted individuals and businesses , '' Allen said in a June 8 letter to BP . BP has paid out close to $ 50 million in damages claims so far along the Gulf Coast -- mostly to fishermen , shrimpers , oystermen and boat operators who say their livelihoods have been impacted by the spill . STILL NO HANDLE ON THE FLOW RATE Allen told reporters that BP planned to move another rig to the spill site on June 14 . This would enable the company to boost its capacity to collect oil from the well to 28,000 barrels -LRB- 1.18 million gallons\\/4 .45 million liters -RRB- a day , he said . Allen did not indicate this meant the flow rate of the oil could be as high as 28,000 barrels a day , but his comments are likely to underscore that neither BP nor the government have yet managed to determine just how much oil is gushing out . Government scientists have estimated that the leak spews 12,000-19 ,000 barrels a day , with one estimate as high as 25,000 barrels . They are due to present revised estimates later this week or early next week . The spill has already fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama . It has also sent tar balls ashore on beaches in Florida . One-third of the Gulf 's federal waters remains closed to fishing and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . BP 's latest containment effort , which follows a series of earlier failed attempts , involved placing a containment cap with a seal on a deep-sea pipe from which the oil is gushing . But the ultimate solution to the leak lies in the drilling of a relief well and that wo n't be completed before August . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . CNN today on Anderson 360 showed HD video of the sawed off well before it had the containment cap . The HD showed that the saw off was really irregular and jagged . It showed huge amounts of gushing oil and gas , much clearer than ever before . Just as a lay person , I can see that this amount of gushing oil has to fill up a barrel in 2-3 seconds at least . Mathematically , if it is just 3 seconds per barrel , that amounts then in 24 hours 28,800 barrels . If it just one second , then 86,400 barrels . Two seconds , 43,200 barrels per day . Five seconds would be 17,280 . But what if it is just 1\\/2 second for one barrel , then it would be 172,800 barrels . Now , an experiment could have been done to gush water at the requisite pressure known to exist with this well . They had pressure readings before the blow out to know that number . So , with an experiment , they can find out how much water is ejected out of a pipe at this pressure , and convert to the density of oil , to come up with the time factor on gushing oil per second , or seconds . This is not really rocket science , but basically 10th grade math . My big question , is why is the govt hiding this from the people I can understand the criminals at BP hiding and obscuring this critical information . But why is Obama and everybody in the govt hiding the truth from us ? I already see the writing on the wall . This is going to be the emergency Rham and Obama use to push energy legislation to force our country away from carbon related energy and to punish us with the carbon credit purchase scheme that will make Gore rich .

A plumber by trade , the Pensacola , Florida resident expected to have a busy and profitable summer . He had three big jobs lined up -- vacation homes being built in this summer tourist haven on the coast of the Florida Panhandle . It was more than enough work for a one-man operation . But the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that began in April is now depriving Chernekoff of his source of income . Unsure how deeply the spill would affect the market for $ 5,000-a-week time shares , investors stopped work on the projects . Chernekoff suddenly found himself without a job . `` I 'm telling you , that was a kick in the pants , '' said Chernekoff , who is trying to seek compensation from British energy giant BP Plc. . As state and BP officials respond to the biggest oil spill in U.S. history , Chernekoff 's predicament is echoed across Florida 's Gulf Coast . One economist calculated the state could lose up to 195,000 jobs and nearly $ 11 billion in economic activity from the prolonged impact of oil washing up on Florida shores . So far , only a few northwest Florida beaches have been littered with tar balls . The hotels remain relatively full along the Florida Panhandle , a summer tourist destination for many U.S. residents within driving distance from Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee , Arkansas and Louisiana . But economic development officials are eyeing the Gulf and bracing for higher concentrations of oil that would shut down their beaches and send travelers elsewhere . `` I talked to some hotel folks and it looks like they were packed over the weekend , '' said Buck Lee , director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority , as he toured Pensacola Beach this week . `` The question is : how long will it last ? '' Long before Walt Disney Co made its mark in Florida , tourists came to the `` Sunshine State '' for its beaches . The tourism industry pumps more than $ 60 billion a year into the state economy . Gulf Coast communities are even more dependent upon the seasonal industry , which in northern Florida peaks in the summer months . Economist Sean Snaith , who directs the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida in Orlando , said a conservative estimate has the state losing at least $ 2.2 billion in revenue and 39,000 jobs . That 's assuming a 10 percent decline in employment and output in tourism-related business in the 23 counties on the Florida Gulf Coast . If the impact becomes more severe or prolonged , dropping employment and output in half , Snaith said the state could lose nearly $ 11 billion in business activity and more than 195,00 jobs . That would be a body blow to a state just recovering from a housing market crash and suffering high unemployment . He acknowledges that exact numbers are difficult to nail down . `` A hurricane passes through and it 's a limited duration event . There 's damage and you can figure it out , '' Snaith said . `` Here , we do n't know when -LRB- the oil -RRB- is going to arrive or how long it 's going to stay . To use a hurricane analogy , we do n't know what category it 's going to be . '' His calculations did not take into account predictions that ocean currents could carry the oil around to Florida 's Atlantic Coast as well as the Gulf . State tourism officials have been trying to spread the word that most Florida beaches remain untainted by the spill . It 's a moving target . In Perdido Key , off Florida 's Panhandle , local health officials on Tuesday posted notices on the beaches telling visitors not to swim . It was the first such advisory posted for Florida beaches because of the oil spill . By Wednesday morning , however , tar balls were few and far between and no oil sheen was present . Florida marketing officials are tailoring their messages to would-be tourists and offering live beach updates on the state 's website , www.visitflorida.com . Local economic development officials are doing the same , but it 's hard to compete with around-the-clock media coverage of a story with global interest . `` There is a whole lot of anxiety and a lot of concern , '' said Chris Thompson , president and CEO of VisitFlorida , the state 's tourist marketing arm . `` Our battle is to separate the misperceptions from reality . '' Bill Stromquist , treasurer of the Perdido Key Area Chamber of Commerce in northwest Florida , said local booster efforts were being hurt by tourism officials in other states . During a recent road trip down the U.S. eastern seaboard , Stromquist said he stopped at state-run visitor information stations in each state along the way . In each place , he was told incorrectly that Florida beaches were closed . `` They 're killing us and I do n't know how to fix it , '' Stromquist told state tourism representatives on Wednesday . `` People are canceling before they get the information that the beaches are clean . '' A state-run advertising campaign paid for by $ 25 million in BP cash appears to be helping fill rooms in the Panhandle region . The BP-backed effort , which was criticized for taking too long to begin , follows advertisements paid for by the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association . State officials have been trying to respond . On Monday , Florida Governor Charlie Crist launched a state-run program that will provide low-interest loans of up to $ 25,000 for businesses affected by the spill . BP so far has paid nearly $ 50 million in lost-income claims across Gulf states , including more than $ 6 million in Florida . Officials are also considering measures to provide property tax credits and to relax sales tax collection rules in an effort to help businesses address cash-flow problems brought on by the unexpected dip in revenue . `` This has caught a lot of businesses off guard , especially for May and June , '' said Lisa Echeverri , executive director of the Florida Department of Revenue . `` There are a number of things we can do to help businesses . '' Meanwhile , local officials must still contend with cost-conscious travelers trying to make the most out of their summer break . `` If I 'm spending $ 3,000 for a vacation , I 'm not going where there are any too many ` ifs , ' '' Stromquist said . -LRB- Editing by Jane Sutton and Will Dunham -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1616", "dct": "2010-06-09", "dates": ["2010-06-09", "2010-06-09", "1909-01-01"], "text": "LONDON | Wed Jun 9 , 2010 3:02 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc has bought terms such as `` oil spill '' from search engine providers including Google Inc to help direct Internet users to its website as it attempts to control the worst oil spill in U.S. history .

Full Article U.S. experts confirm undersea oil from BP well HOUSTON | Wed Jun 9 , 2010 3:49 am IST HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. experts investigating reports of undersea oil plumes emanating from BP Plc 's stricken well in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday confirmed the presence of low levels of oil below the surface . `` NOAA is confirming the presence of very low concentrations of subsurface oil , '' Jane Lubchenco , administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told a briefing in Washington . It was the first government confirmation of undersea oil near BP 's blown-out well a mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- beneath the ocean . Previously , both NOAA and BP have played down the possibility of undersea plumes . When university researchers aboard the Pelican research ship last month reported finding an underwater plume roughly 20 miles -LRB- 32 km -RRB- long , NOAA issued a statement criticizing the findings as `` misleading , premature and , in some cases , inaccurate . '' BP officials have said that oil from the well rises to the surface because it is lighter than water . `` There are n't any plumes , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said on May 30 . But after analyzing underwater samples gathered by researchers aboard the University of South Florida 's research vessel , the Weatherbird II , a different conclusion emerged . `` The bottom line is yes , there is oil in the water column , '' Lubchenco said . `` NOAA is confirming the presence of very low concentrations of subsurface oil at sampling depths ranging from the surface to 3,300 feet -LRB- 1,006 metres -RRB- at locations 40 -LRB- 74 km -RRB- and 42 nautical miles -LRB- 78 km -RRB- northeast of the well site and another sampling station at 142 nautical miles -LRB- 263 km -RRB- southeast of the wellhead , '' Lubchenco said . The oil is `` in very low concentrations '' around 0.5 parts per million , '' and other NOAA research ships are in the Gulf to gather additional samples , she said . Undersea oil depletes the water 's oxygen content and threatens marine life like mussels , clams , crabs , eels , jellyfish and shrimp . One researcher who recently studied the undersea oil aboard the NOAA research ship Thomas Jefferson said the oil detected south of the spill site appeared to be in small concentrations . `` These are not like rivers of oil flowing down deep , '' said Daniel Torres , a scientist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts . `` We 're detecting pretty low levels . '' NOAA has been trying to `` fingerprint '' the oil to confirm that it came from the BP well . Surface samples taken 40 miles northeast of the well were `` consistent with the BP oil spill , '' but hydrocarbons from samples taken 42 miles and 162 miles from the well `` were in concentrations too low to do the actual fingerprinting , '' Lubchenco said . The U.S. government and BP have concentrated their efforts on corralling the oil that floats to the surface and washes ashore in what is the worst oil spill in U.S. history . But the government has little experience in dealing with subsea oil , said Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup effort . `` We have not generally done subsurface responses , '' Allen told the news conference . `` In my own personal experience I have not dealt with it . '' BP has sprayed about 1 million gallons -LRB- 3.8 million litres -RRB- of chemical dispersant on oil at the ocean surface and wellhead , which causes the oil to either dissipate or sink to the ocean floor . Scientists involved in the studies will testify on Wednesday before a House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee panel that is probing the spill . Among those testifying will be Samantha Joye , a University of Georgia marine sciences professor who last month reported finding a plume roughly 20 miles -LRB- 32 km -RRB- long , six miles -LRB- 10 km -RRB- wide , and 100 feet -LRB- 30 metres -RRB- thick . It could take years to assess the impact of the spill on underwater life , Joye said . `` When you interfere with the natural processes in a system , when you alter the carbon cycle and the oxygen cycle , it 's very likely that impacts will cascade up the food web to the top predators , '' she said .

The news that the flow rate may be as high 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- per day came after U.S. markets closed . BP shares closed 6.65 percent down in London at 365.50 pence while in New York they rebounded from 14-year lows to end 12.3 percent higher at $ 32.78 . On Thursday the White House said that President Barack Obama and senior administration officials would meet BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg next Wednesday . BP has come under increased pressure from the Obama administration in recent days and on Thursday British Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain stood ready to help the British company deal with the spill . Speaking during a visit to Afghanistan , Cameron said he would take up the matter Obama when they speak in the next few days . Neighboring Mexico also entered the fray on Thursday . It expects oil from BP Plc 's damaged Gulf of Mexico well to reach its shores by December , and is considering how to sue the company for any environmental damage , Mexico 's environment minister told Reuters . Environment Minister Juan Elvira said Mexico is trying to stock up on oil booms and netting , a tough task because the United States has used up most of the gear available to protect its coastline , to try to capture oil that will start drifting south when sea currents change in October . The spill , already the worst in U.S. history , may well be much bigger than many had thought . U.S. scientists said on Thursday that between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 and 1.7 million gallons\\/3 .2 million and 6.4 million liters -RRB- of oil flowed from the well before June 3 , when BP 's remotely operated robots sawed through an underwater pipe to clear the way for a capping procedure . The cutting of the pipe likely increased the flow , but BP says it has collected 73,324 barrels -LRB- 3.1 million gallons\\/11 ,7 million liters -RRB- of oil since installing the capping system . The well 's average flow rate was 25,000-30 ,000 bpd , according to the findings of the so-called Flow Rate Technical Group announced by U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt . BP had no input into the team 's findings . The wide variation in the estimates points to the difficulty in estimating flow of a well that is 1 mile beneath the surface and reachable only by remotely operated robots . BP said it was capturing more of the torrent of oil that has spewed relentlessly from the sea bottom since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and set the disaster in motion . But the almost 16,000 barrels it said on Thursday it had collected in the previous 24 hours is triple its initial estimates of the leak 's flow rate , a point that will not be lost on critics as U.S. public and political anger mount . In another sign the spill is spreading , heavier concentrations of oil began washing up on Florida seashores late on Wednesday . Until then , debris from the spill had been limited in the state to relatively small tar balls . It is taking a mounting toll on sea birds and other wildlife and has devastated the commercial and recreational fishing industries in southern Louisiana . The Obama administration has kept up the heat , saying it would make sure BP paid all damages and cleanup costs from the spill , which has soiled 120 miles of coastline . The crisis is now on the global diplomatic agenda for allies Britain and America . Cameron 's comments in Kabul marked the first time he had spoken publicly about the catastrophe . Cameron , who took office in May and is under pressure domestically to stand up for the British company , is due to talk to Obama by telephone this weekend . Obama has been sharply critical of BP . The two leaders ' conversation will have to seek a delicate balance between domestic pressures and long-standing U.S.-British ties . They will also take place against a backdrop of extreme market volatility for BP . BP was the second-most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday after taking a 16-percent dive to a 14-year-low the previous day amid concerns over BP 's ability to meet mounting costs . `` The stock is obviously volatile as investors try to wager on the outcome of the Gulf oil spill , '' said Jud Pyle , chief investment strategist at Options News Network , a division of option market maker PEAK6 Investments in Chicago . Analysts said the company 's improved performance was partly due to speculation that PetroChina , Asia 's top oil and gas firm , was considering making a bid for BP . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Sounds like they 're a team to me . And guess who the opponents are ? This is not a political problem , the fix and cleanup will go on for years . Obama is only a President with limited powers , there is the judical branch of government that deals with the final damage assesment . Remember , America is a democracy , there is no King or Queen like in the UK . My best guess is that BP will have to sell the company to pay for all the final damages . The buyer most likely will be Chevron , or Royal Dutch Shell . This discussion is now closed . We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication .

BP 's shares plunged this week and investors scooped up insurance to protect against the possibility the company will default on its debt . For now , though , experts who sort out bankrupt companies say there is little likelihood that financially strong BP will need to seek protection from creditors . `` At this moment , the likelihood of BP filing for bankruptcy is probably remote because it has access to billions of dollars in credit , solid cash flow and a healthy balance sheet , '' said Brad Sandler , a bankruptcy attorney with Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones in Wilmington , Delaware . Jon Pack , a BP spokesman in Houston , said the company had not been in discussion with anyone regarding bankruptcy . The big question : How long will it be before BP finally caps the well that is spewing crude into the Gulf of Mexico , befouling shorelines and threatening fishing grounds ? Stephen Lubben , a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark , New Jersey said he did n't think BP would seek bankruptcy unless `` we 're still talking about this in 2011 and the price tag has reached $ 75 billion or $ 100 billion . '' BP has said it has the financial flexibility to deal with liabilities related to the spill , which to date have cost it about $ 1.4 billion . The financials tell the story of a trim company in peak condition . Its assets exceed its liabilities , a measure of solvency or shareholders ' equity , by more than $ 100 billion . It has had at least $ 24 billion in net operating cash flow for each of the last five years , according to financial filings . BP is no Lehman Brothers , which vanished into Chapter 11 virtually overnight in a market panic . Lehman 's reported liabilities exceeded its shareholder equity by 23 times . If Lehman Brothers was a tower of assets on a razor-thin foundation of equity , BP is virtually the opposite -- a squat structure of stability . `` In the pure economic world of bankruptcy , do they have enough money to pay their debts ? I do n't think any of us know that for a fact , '' said Robert Stark , a bankruptcy attorney with Brown Rudnick in New York . `` At least in the short term they have the capability to pay . '' The costliest U.S. oil spill was the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident , which cost about $ 4 billion for clean-up , fines and damages , although it spilled less than a third the oil leaked by the Deepwater Horizon accident . Hurricane Katrina , the worst disaster in U.S. history , ran up insured losses of about $ 41 billion . The bankruptcy talk was stoked on Wednesday by a report in Fortune magazine , which quoted Matt Simmons of boutique investment bank Simmons & Co , who said BP had a month before it would file for bankruptcy . BP shares traded in New York tumbled 16 percent . On Thursday , Simmons ' office said he would not be able to return calls until June 15 and that there were `` three pages of names '' of reporters who called for an interview . Legal liabilities related to asbestos have been forcing U.S. companies into bankruptcy for nearly 20 years , and their experience could be a blueprint for BP . Typically , a liability-dogged company files for Chapter 11 protection from creditors , establishes a process to value claims and sets up a trust to pay those claims . The bankruptcy immediately consolidates all legal action in one court , before one judge , eliminating the uncertainty of jury trials in varying jurisdictions . A bankrupt BP would look a lot like the current BP -- it would continue to be a major supplier of energy to the world and a major employer . As attractive as that might be , it is not something BP could or would do now , according to bankruptcy professionals . David Skeel , a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in Philadelphia said BP would be hard pressed to find a bankruptcy court that would accept a Chapter 11 petition . `` They are so obviously solvent , '' he said . Just last month , the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware punished a subsidiary of Transocean Ltd , which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig , for trying to use Chapter 11 to limit its liability from an unrelated spill in Louisiana . Skeel said a bankruptcy might make sense in the next two years , once the spill is capped . `` One benefit to filing is to bite the bullet , swallow it and move on . They will have this continuing water torture of litigation , '' he said . Another option might be a trust established outside of bankruptcy , which would shield the company from the uncertainties of Chapter 11 , but this would probably need the involvement of the U.S. government . The best thing for Washington is to have a BP continuing to generate cash and earnings to pay claims . `` If BP declared bankruptcy it will be viewed poorly by investors and credit markets , '' said Robert Hartwig , the president of the Insurance Information Institute in New York . One sign of trouble : BP is already being forced to pay more for short-term debt and commercial paper , a form of borrowing that companies use to manage cash flow . The yield on its debt coming due next year has risen above its bonds due in 2019 , a red flag that could signal fraying market nerves . `` A company that is ` solvent ' on a balance sheet basis can end up in Chapter 11 if creditors panic and the company develops cash flow problems , '' said Lubben , the Seton Hall law professor .

The opinions expressed are his own . - The news that a huge metal cap has been successfully placed over several of the leaking oil vents at the Deepwater Horizon site marks a potential turning point in the Gulf of Mexico crisis . It is already estimated that each day some 10-15 ,000 barrels of the oil that are spilling out into the ocean are being captured and diverted to ships on the sea surface . Despite this engineering success , a complete end to the oil leakage is unlikely until new relief oil wells are completed -- a drilling process that could take most of the summer , and potentially into the autumn . This is because the newly installed metal cap is unlikely , even in the best case scenario , to stop all of the oil spilling out . In advance of the completion of the relief wells , a potentially major new complicating factor is the arrival of the hurricane season last week . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is already predicting between 8 and 14 hurricanes this season , with perhaps a similar number of smaller storms , any of which could complicate -LRB- or indeed force a postponement -RRB- of the ongoing mitigation and clean-up activities in and around Deepwater Horizon . Although the leakage will therefore continue for weeks to come , and the clean-up operations will take even longer , it is already clear that the disaster will herald a transformation in the oil industry by : cents Signaling a new re-regulatory era , especially in the U.S. , including the new six month moratorium on offshore drilling announced last month by President Barack Obama . Authorities around the North Sea are also reasserting their positions . cents This will be paralleled by movement by the industry towards a new paradigm which , as is explored later in this article , may potentially require companies to adopt new operating models and much better engineering expertise of how to manage and mitigate disasters when they occur , especially in hard-to-reach oil in deep waters . As BP CEO Tony Hayward has asserted , After the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 , the industry created the Marine Spill Response Corporation to contain oil on the sea surface The issue now will be to create the same sub-sea response capability . The crisis is now officially the worst U.S. spill in history , with between 500,000 to 800,000 barrels estimated to have leaked out into the Gulf of Mexico as of May 31 . While still dwarfed by the largest ever off-shore leakage of oil -LRB- an estimated 3,300,000 barrels in 1979 -RRB- at Ixtoc-1 in the Gulf of Mexico s Bay of Campeche , Deepwater Horizon is now at least twice as large a spillage as the 260,000 barrels estimated to have polluted the shores and caused major environmental damage in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 , although it should be realized that the crude oil of that vessel was considerably worse for the local environment . Hence , the reason why Obama re-asserted last week that Deepwater Horizon will be the worst environmental disaster of its kind in U.S. history . With U.S. mid-term congressional elections fast approaching in November , a regulatory clampdown upon the oil drilling industry appears likely . However , re-examining the regulatory framework is just one part of what is now needed . In addition , much more emphasis should also be placed upon enhancing safety technology , and engineering expertise and preparedness of how to manage and mitigate disasters when they do occur , especially in hard-to-reach oil in deep waters . On the safety technology side , we will need , in particular , to improve blow-out preventer technologies . It is also likely that more than one of these blow-out devices will be needed at major sites in the future . Had a second blow-out preventor been in place at Deepwater Horizon , it is possible that the current disaster could have been completely averted . What is also badly needed is better management and mitigation preparation for sub-sea disasters . Much of the equipment that was used in the various attempts to stem the oil flow was hastily designed on the spot and whilst the well was blurting out the oil in huge quantities . Hence , the reason why BP CEO Tony Hayward candidly asserted that his firm did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit to respond faster to the crisis . That the necessary expertise and preparedness has been lacking is reflected in the fact , for instance , that workers have needed to experiment with new technologies and devices such as the five-storey , 100 tonne containment dome which unsuccessfully was used to act as a giant funnel , collecting and piping the oil to the sea surface . Before Deepwater Horizon , this procedure had only been used at much shallower depths with much lower pressures . There is now an urgent need for before-the-event development and experimentation of this , and other techniques , in much deeper waters . Meeting these ambitions head-on will require , in the words of Hayward , nothing less than a paradigm change in the oil industry . At a minimum , this will require all key industry parties -LRB- including exploration and production companies and drilling contractors , but also the engineers and researchers of the major universities with offshore expertise -RRB- to work together more closely to reduce the safety risks . However , it may also require a transformation in the oil industry business model which some assert has become excessively reliant on outsourcing important work to contractors . For instance , while BP was in overall control of the Deepwater Horizon platform , responsibility for safety was shared with Transocean -LRB- which owned and operated the rig -RRB- , Halliburton -LRB- which cemented the wall -RRB- , and Cameron International -LRB- which manufactured the blow-out preventor -RRB- . Reducing the risk of accidents in the future could involve moving towards a different model with less sub-contractors , or at least one company tasked with overall responsibility for safety . Whether such an operating model transformation happens or not , this new safety reform agenda can only be cost-effectively achieved if the oil industry prioritises it . It is likely that the global public will settle for nothing less in the post-Deepwater Horizon world .

REUTERS\\/Lee Celano An excellent summary by Professor Willemse . As a Brit , I am dismayed by Presisdent Obama 's recent anti-BP rhetoric . As terrible as this oil spill is , the very fact that BP is shouldering all the responsibility , and is directing such vast recources at containing the leak and limiting the damage , should be recognized . Their effort has been herculean . As should be their speedy abd unstinting payment of all compensation claims -- the sums of money are vast . At some point the net of culpability will have to be cast wider to include the legislators , Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron International , but in the meantime BP 's efforts should be rocognised . There has always been a strong strand of anti-British sentiment in the US , that seems to me almost 18th century in sentiment . As a Brit , it is disturbing to see President Obama tapping into this for purely populist reasons . Tony Hayword has been lambasted for principly being rather self-deprecating and candid -- qualities perhaps not fully understood in the US . I think he should be congratulated . Put it this way , American politicians are proving considerably more oily . I get the impression that there are some within the US political class , not least President Obama , who wuold like to break BP . It should not be forgotten that 39 % of BP is owned by American shareholders . How much of what is being said now was said after the Ixtoc-1 spill in 1979 ? How many proposals were put forward at that time ? And how many of them were adopted ? My feeling is that all this has been said before but the big-oil lobby got to work after things had calmed down in 1979 and stopped anything important happening . The same will happen now . Governments never seem to learn that business can not be trusted to regulate itself -- the financial industry is another great example . I would also agree with the previous poster regarding culpability . Yes BP was the responsible company and needs to pay for the consequences of it 's actions , but so too do Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron International . The furore in the US press now feels like foreigner bashing without looking closer to home . How much of what Exxon was ordered to pay in compensation after Alaska has it actually paid ? And how quickly was it paid ? I 'm sure it was n't ordered to pay for lost wages for the last 20 years . As a temporary measure to minimize damage while relief wells are being drilled , I wonder whether the oil could be funneled directly from the uncapped vents to a tanker or other holding container -LRB- positioned at the site -RRB- , where from it could be transported and utilized .

British Prime Minister David Cameron and his finance minister George Osborne stressed the London-based company was economically important to both Britain and the United States . The British government 's backing helped boost BP shares , which have been battered this week as the Obama administration ratcheted up criticism of the company over the 53-day-old spill , the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . Millions of gallons of oil have poured into the Gulf since an April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers and ruptured BP 's deep-sea well . U.S. scientists on Thursday doubled their estimate of the amount of oil flowing from the well . BP has been capturing oil from the leaking well since installing a containment system , or cap , last week . It is moving a second ship to the spill site to enable it to increase the amount of oil it is siphoning from the well `` toward the end of June , '' the Obama administration 's point man for the disaster , Admiral Thad Allen , said . Under U.S. government direction , BP also plans to nearly double its oil-collecting capacity by mid-July . The upgraded oil collection system could potentially siphon up to 50,000 barrels a day , Allen said . The well will not be sealed until August , when two relief wells now being drilled are due to be completed . In the meantime , an unknown amount of oil still gushes forth . Energy Secretary Steven Chu told Reuters that BP 's latest effort to capture the leaking oil had not made the spill dramatically worse , dispelling fears of government scientists that it could increase the flow of crude by up to 20 percent . `` The estimates of 20 percent or more are incorrect , '' Chu said . Obama administration officials have threatened to increase BP 's liabilities for the spill , which is causing an ecological and economic disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast . U.S. lawmakers are also pressuring the company to suspend its dividend to ensure it has enough cash to pay for cleaning up the mess . House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday BP should be subjected to unlimited liability costs and should pay all damage claims before issuing the dividend . BP is considering putting money for the dividend in an escrow account until the full scale of the company 's liabilities can be determined , the Times of London reported , quoting people familiar with the situation . It said BP board members were discussing a plan to defer the second quarter dividend , due to be announced on July 27 . A BP spokesman told Reuters the company was considering all options but no decision had been made . Meanwhile , oil drilling firm Transocean Ltd. resolved its spat with the Obama administration over its bid to limit its liability in the sinking of its rig , which triggered the spill , according to court papers filed on Friday . British Prime Minister Cameron spoke to BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg and expressed frustration about the damage caused by the spill , a spokesman for Cameron said . `` He -LRB- the prime minister -RRB- said that it is in everyone 's interests that BP continues to be a financially strong and stable company , '' the spokesman said . Osborne , Britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , said after speaking to BP CEO Tony Hayward , `` The prime minister is also clear that we need constructive solutions and that we remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America . '' Forty percent of BP 's shareholders are in the United States , with the same percentage based in Britain . Business leaders , politicians and newspapers have pressed Cameron to defend BP against the Obama administration , whose criticism of the British company has been portrayed in British media as Britain-bashing . Cameron , who took office in May , is due to discuss the Gulf of Mexico crisis with Obama in a telephone call at 11 a.m. EDT on Saturday . The call will be a tricky test for the two leaders . Both are under pressure to appear tough to voters at home . Obama , criticized by some in the United States over his handling of the crisis , has been seeking to direct public anger and frustration over the spill toward BP . For his part , Cameron must show Britons that he is not caving in to pressure from his country 's most powerful ally . A spokeswoman for Cameron said the prime minister 's telephone call with Obama would be `` statesmanlike and workmanlike . '' A White House official played down the BP focus , saying it would be just one of a number of issues raised . Shares in BP , which have lost tens of billions of dollars in value since the crisis began on April 20 , closed up 7.2 percent in London trading , rebounding from Thursday 's 13-year low and extending a rally that began in New York on Thursday . BP 's American depositary shares finished up 3.63 percent in New York on Friday . `` Possibly people have taken heart from the fact that the political rhetoric is not just one side of the Atlantic , '' said Barclays Capital analyst Lucy Haskins . Investors appeared unfazed by the news from U.S. scientists that the well 's flow rate may be as high 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- per day . The new estimates could have huge financial implications because under the U.S. Clean Water Act , BP and others could face fines up to $ 4,300 for every barrel leaked . With more than 2 million barrels of oil already in the ocean , that could mean fines of $ 8.6 billion at least . BP expects the total bill for the clean-up of the spill , which has affected 120 miles of U.S. coastline and closed down rich fishing grounds , will be $ 3 - $ 6 billion , an analyst briefed by BP said in a research note on Friday . The slick has already fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama . Tar balls have also washed up on Florida 's famous white beaches . One third of the Gulf 's federal waters remain closed for fishing . `` BP and all involved have downplayed this from day one . Everyone knew it was more than they reported and now basically it 's been proven , '' said Kindra Arnesen , a restaurant owner in Venice , Louisiana , whose husband makes his living fishing .

China is the most polluting nation on the planet , with no food , drug , or environmental laws to speak of . Half the stuff that is imported from there has poisonous compounds . That 's all we need -- from the frying pan into the fire . BP is the new Altria .

The underlying fear is that Macondo is the oil industry 's Three Mile Island , an accident that turned public opinion against nuclear power for three decades . Investors are right to fear the long-term impact on the company . But they exaggerate the impact on the wider industry and the prospects for climate change legislation . BP however faces a very changed operating environment in future . Deepwater and ultra-deepwater petroleum wells are just one of a suite of advanced technologies energy producers have been using to extend the peak in conventional oil production . In its 2008 World Energy Outlook , the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- estimated worldwide deepwater and ultra-deepwater reserves at 200 billion barrels . Even complete loss of deepwater and ultra-deepwater oil production would have only a marginal impact on total energy supply in the decades to come . In any event , it seems unlikely deepwater exploration and production will be abandoned . Most policymakers recognize there is no practical alternative . Lukewarm public support for climate change legislation shows how little appetite there is for measures significantly increasing the cost of fossil fuels or forcing reductions in energy consumption . The industry actually has a good track record of operating in extremely challenging environments at huge depths and under massive pressures with few accidents . One reason Macondo has stirred such intense passions is because it is so unusual . The public , regulators and the industry itself have become used to the miracle of pulling oil up from deep below the surface without any real understanding of the engineering challenges involved . It has bred complacency . Deepwater drilling will continue , probably under a tougher permitting and inspection regime , with additional fail-safe and disaster-recovery systems , adding to the industry 's costs . But higher safety and compliance costs will not materially affect oil prices going forward . Extra compliance might add $ 2-3 to the price of a barrel of deepwater oil , but this is inconsequential compared with the vast expense of conducting seismic surveys under miles of seawater , mud and salt ; rig hire ; and the exploration risks of drilling dry wells . Anyway , oil prices are set at the margin by the highest-cost form of production , and deepwater and ultra-deepwater are not the marginal source of supply . Other technologies such as tar sands , shale oil , and in the medium-term gas-to-liquids -LRB- GTL -RRB- and coal-to-liquids -LRB- CTL -RRB- are all more expensive and will set prices , not deepwater . If it does happen , slower development of deepwater resources would have its biggest impact in the three-six year timeframe , when other technologies are still relatively immature and unable to fill the gap . For the moment , however , oil resources look comfortable in the medium term . The banking crisis and worldwide recession in 2007-09 have shifted the global economy onto a lower and slower growth trajectory , freeing up energy resources and improving the medium-term supply-demand outlook . Macondo would have had an enormous impact if it had occurred in H1 2008 . In the current environment , with spare capacity , the industry can absorb the potential loss of supply more easily . BILL STILL ON ROAD TO NOWHERE In the near term , Macondo complicates the passage of climate change legislation pending before the U.S. Senate . But the impact should not be exaggerated . The bill 's prospects were already poor and it has been heavily watered down . The emerging deal would have seen the Obama administration and congressional Democrats open up more offshore areas to drilling in exchange for at least some Republican and energy industry support for the modified cap-and-trade provisions set out in Senator John Kerry 's re-named American Power Act . That deal looks an increasingly hard sell , one reason President Barack Obama and senior officials are furious with BP . Even before the spill , however , it was far from clear the drilling-for-climate deal would secure the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to move forward . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Despite revisions to cap-and-trade , delaying its introduction for manufacturers and promising greater offshore acreage , there has been no lessening of hostility from Senate Republicans . The only Republican to support the compromise initially , South Carolina 's Senator Lindsey Graham , had already dropped his sponsorship under pressure from the party leadership and conservative activists . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Coastal Democrats were more or less united in their hostility to more offshore drilling well before Macondo . Ten coastal-state Democratic senators wrote to Kerry in March to oppose putting drilling into the climate and energy bill . They included Bill Nelson -LRB- Florida -RRB- , Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg -LRB- New Jersey -RRB- , Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed -LRB- Rhode Island -RRB- , Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin -LRB- Maryland -RRB- , Ted Kaufman -LRB- Delaware -RRB- , and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley -LRB- Oregon -RRB- . `` While technological advances have attempted to lower the environmental and economic risks of drilling , experience has shown that no technology is foolproof ... Far from being a thing of the past , spills occur with alarming frequency '' , they wrote , with what now seems like horrible prescience . With industrial and coal-state Democrats opposed to raising the burden on manufacturers and coal-producers , coastal Democrats opposed to drilling , and Republicans leery of a potentially unpopular compromise , the climate bill has a mountain to climb , and is running out of time before the mid-term elections . UNLUCKY BP SET FOR BIG CHANGE While Macondo will not have much impact on the wider industry , the effect on BP itself could be far more severe . Since the problems with Exxon Valdez -LRB- 1989 -RRB- and Brent Spar -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , BP 's rivals Exxon and Shell have largely avoided major accidents . Both were searing experiences , prompting an overhaul of internal controls and safety culture . In contrast , BP 's North American operations have been plagued by a string of accidents and scandals -- including the Texas City refinery explosion -LRB- which killed 15 and injured 170 others in 2005 -RRB- ; the sinking of the celebrated Thunder Horse platform -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; and leaks and corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline network . -LRB- 2006 -RRB- BP pleaded guilty to felony charges in the Texas City case , and was sentenced to $ 50 million fine and three-years probation . As BP American Chairman Bob Malone accepted at the time `` If our approach to process safety and risk management had been more disciplined and comprehensive , this tragedy could have been prevented '' . BP also received a fine and probation for Alaska . The company has also paid a civil monetary penalty of $ 303 million for attempting to manipulate the propane market -LRB- 2004 -RRB- . The settlement beguilingly concluded `` all criminal investigations of BP America on matters related to propane , gasoline , crude oil and other commodity trading '' , implying the CFTC was looking at other issues as well . The incidents may or may not reflect shortcomings in management and culture . Maybe the company has just been unlucky . But the number of them in quick succession is beginning to look disturbing . Rightly or wrongly , BP North America is being singled out by U.S. officials as a problematic part of the industry . Deepwater drilling will undoubtedly resume , under a tougher inspection regime . But BP may cede ground to its less accident-prone peers and will come under fierce pressure to change its operating and management practices . It is that fear markets are reflecting with the collapse in the share price . The direct costs of the clean up are only one of the company 's problems . BP 's number one priority now is to make sure that the next time a well blows , it belongs to someone else . There are similarities as well as differences between Deepwater Horizon and Three Mile Island . The similarities involve the powers that be lying after the fact to downplay the extent of their respective disasters and the enormity of ensuing long-term effects , which would lead one to conclude that similarly casual -LRB- when it comes to the lives of others -RRB- individuals are in charge of both situations at corporate and government levels . The difference is that the noxiousness of the escaping carcinogens from Three Mile Island and the inevitability of more such incidents led correctly to a moratorium on nuclear power plants in the United States , whereas in the case of Deepwater Horizon all that is really necessary once the incredible mess has been cleared up is that attainable safety standards and procedures are never again bypassed . In both cases , it is unlikely that those responsible will ever remunerate in full those whom they 've harmed because a -RRB- the culpable executives are stingy , unprincipled scoundrels who tend to litigate rather than act decently ; and b -RRB- because in the case of Three Mile Island , the damage will continue for more than a million years , and is thus difficult to fully assess . Not so in BP 's case . Or rather , not necessarily so -- a lot here depends on BP . TOTAL MEDIA BLACKOUT ON GULF OIL SPILL and FAA Closes Airspace over the Gulf Well , obviously the journalists fear for their jobs too ! Because otherwise they 'd write the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ! Instead of which , the mainstream media continues to downplay the size of this catastrophe and assume that the general public are gullible idiots . This is now several steps too far but never fear , the Truth always outs in the end and heads will roll ! HOW much oil is under the Gulf ? No , it 's not Three Mile Island . It 's Chernobyl -- considering the scale of environmental catastrophe . Just remember Reuters is the company that once had a writer refeer to OPAC a proven funder of terriost , as a CLUB . Saudi costs for producing oil are the lowest in the world : according to Ali Al-Naimi , -LRB- Saudi oil minister -RRB- the cost to produce one barrel is less than $ 2 . -LRB- a direct quote -RRB- Saudi Arabia reportedly -LRB- ?? -RRB- needs to sell oil for at least $ 55 dollars a barrel to cover the cost of running the country . Fossil fuels finance 75 percent of the country 's entire domestic spending budget . For the above references click article -LRB- Bottom pg 2 , top pg 3 -RRB- Question : does this include the hundreds of Millions , even Billions of dollars dispersed yearly to the Thousands of Saudi princes to finance their Preposterous , Extravert lifestyles ??? Not to mention the Millions -LRB- Billions ?? -RRB- of dollars of extortion paid to terrorist organizations . Where did You think all that money was coming from ? we 've had discussions up the ying yang . what we need Now is a LEADER . there is an old saying , `` if you ca n't lead , get behind me and push '' if there R a thousan boats out there get two thousand . if there are a thousand people on the beaches get five thousand . if the president thinks he 's too bright to get his feet wet and his hands dirty then get the Vice president out there . Get Someone OUT in FRONT of this mess and MAKE something happen , Who cares !!! My boyfriend thinks the same with me . He - is eight years older than me , lol . Maybe you wanna check out or - tell your friends Are you kidding me John ? This article makes no sense . 3MI was a disaster to the industry because it was a disaster , and this is no different . This is n't about hydrocarbon needs or reserves just as well as 3MI not being about us running out of plutonium . The disaster at hand is just that . For decades to come , that region will be polluted , and the economics of tourism and fisheries will be in turmoil . You do realize that there is a human scale to all of this rather than just oil economics right ? Look past the need to write a sympathetic fluff piece and get to the real meat an potatoes thank you . I never thought I 'd say it but I do believe Reuters has lost its objectivity . You should be ashamed of yourselves , or else you should sell off your BP portfolio before it is too late . As well , this disaster will leave a lasting opinion , fear , and hate of the oil industry just as 3MI did to the nuclear industry . Do n't kid yourself , because it has already happened . One of these days you journalists are going to wake up and realize the proles have finally awakened from their ignorance and the propaganda no longer works . From the looks of these responses , it 's already happening . Just more London based Reuters spewing complete and utter BS ! This thing is not even remotely contained and this nonsensical moron is trying to draw parallels . Give me an Fing break - complete tripe - you guys would n't have made believable stories for Pravda ! In contrast , BP s North American operations have been plagued by a string of accidents and scandals including -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Texas City refinery explosion -LRB- which killed 15 and injured 170 others in 2005 -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the sinking of the celebrated Thunder Horse platform -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- leaks and corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline network . 3 strikes and still not out ? How was BP allowed to undertake such a high-risk project in the first place with this kind of track record ? Who 's getting rich behind this ? Posted by doctorjay317 | Report as abusive I agree with the article . People were angry about 3MI enough to fight new nuclear plants because there are alternatives . People are angry at BP , but not enough to quit using oil products . The industry wo n't be affected in the long term . People who were relatively casual about Three Mile Island are now looking at the BP fiasco , seeing the same thing all over again only with less radioactivity . A certain Jarvis Cocker song comes to mind . You know the one . Thunderhorse is a joint Exxon BP venture and it did n't sink it listed badly and is in production today . Reuters get your facts right what about reminding the public of Ixtoc 1 flowing from Mexico for almost 10 months !! Mexico claimed sovereign immunity for damages from the US !!!! That leak soiled 162 miles of US beaches ! This is n't Three Mile Island , it 's worse ! 3MI did not result in one confirmed human death , while the Deepwater explosion has already claimed 11 lives . It 's a shame the corresponding public opinion does n't have a modicrum of discernment . BP is going to pay over $ 50 billion when this all said and done . We just launched a Facebook competitor at story+burn.com Of course , the BP disaster is not like Three Mile Island . Three Mile Island accident did not kill anyone ; the BP accident killed eleven people . Three Mile Island did not harm anyone in any way . Radiation release was so small in the Three Mile Island accident that one gets more radiation dose from flying across the country in a jet domestic flight . Who knows today what the human adverse effects will be from the BP disaster , but it will be very large indeed . The environmental effects could be extreme in the BP disaster , not so for the Three Mile Island accident . The Three Mile Island accident was an economic disaster to the tune of $ 6 Billion dollars in today 's dollars -LRB- replacement cost for a plant today -RRB- . The BP disaster will be considerably more than this and bring down a huge company with a lot of layoffs of mostly very good people . The utility owning the nuclear plant survives today . The similarity between the two events is that human error caused problems to be amplified leading to failure . In Three Mile Island , safety systems composed of multiple backup systems ultimately saved the situation and prevented adverse effects on the public . This was not the case for the BP disaster because there were no redundancy of diverse safety systems . Deep sea drilling could learn a lot from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -LRB- NRC -RRB- of the US government that places regulations on the nuclear industry and enforces such . It 's time for corporate\\/business punishments to exceed the gross revenue to have been derived from the incident 's resource . If they had to give over the expected revenues from the well , they would not make mistakes . If one well would break the company , then it should n't be in business . Small fry should n't be in big business . No more wrist slaps . Time to reform ALL businesses\\/types of incorporation excess . Financial , Energy , et al , ad nauseum . Corporate aristocracy needs be tore down , rebuilt . Estimates vary , but they 'll still be `` cleaning up '' Hanford until at least 2040 . At TMI , `` cleanup '' appears to amount largely to not talking about the extent of the core meltdown or how much radioactive gas really escaped . Exxon has n't paid up all the court-ordered damages it owes on the 1989 Valdez catastrophe . BP has yet to show much comprehension of the nature and extent of damage caused by it and\\/or its contract partners over several recent events . Fair enough , these disasters are n't all the same . Just , there 's too many of them involving the same sort of happy-go-lucky amateur executives with connections in high places , is all . Just wondering if there were any fines or penalties for the management or companies responsible for the `` Three Mile Island '' disaster .

Obama also said his frustration with BP was not about national identity after criticism from some in Britain that his rhetoric had taken on an anti-British tone . Oil gushed from a blown-out undersea well for the 54th day , adding to the millions of gallons that have poured into the Gulf since an April 20 offshore rig blast killed 11 workers . The ecological disaster spread along the U.S. Gulf Coast , contaminating beaches and wildlife habitats , killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins , and damaging the region 's lucrative tourism and fishing industries . The ruptured well is estimated to be spewing out up to 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.7 million gallons\\/6 .4 million liters -RRB- of oil a day , and it is only partly contained . The United States has told the London-based energy giant to come up with a better containment plan in two days . In a 30-minute phone call , the U.S. and British leaders attempted to play down tensions over the oil spill . Obama said he had no interest in undermining the value of BP , according to a statement from Cameron 's office . BP , a staple holding of British pension funds , has lost tens of billions of dollars of its market value and is under pressure from some U.S. lawmakers to suspend its dividend until the Gulf crisis is resolved and damages are paid out to individuals and businesses in the region . But Obama , according to a U.S. official , said he will insist that BP pays clean-up costs and meets economic claims from the oil spill . Cameron , who took office last month , has come under pressure to do more to protect a company that accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by British companies . The two leaders reaffirmed their confidence in the strength of ties between their countries . `` President Obama said to the Prime Minister that his unequivocal view was that BP was a multinational global company and that frustrations about the oil spill had nothing to do with national identity , '' Cameron 's office said . BP expects the total bill for the clean-up to be $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion . BP 's board , which has met weekly since the crisis started , could take up the issue of the dividend on Monday . But a source said a decision may not be made until after BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has met with Obama at the White House on Wednesday . Before meeting with Svanberg , Obama -- facing criticism for not responding aggressively enough -- is due to return to the Gulf Coast on Monday for the fourth time since the crisis erupted . He plans to survey the response effect , and meet with Gulf residents and officials during a two-day visit . On Saturday , news emerged that a U.S. Coast Guard official told BP that the company 's plans to contain the spill do not go far enough or include enough back-up measures . `` BP must identify in the next 48 hours additional leak containment capacity that could be operationalized and expedited , '' Coast Guard Rear Admiral James Watson said in a letter to BP dated June 11 . Watson said BP 's current plan did not go far enough to have backup resources in place in the event of equipment failure or other problems . `` Every effort must be expended to speed up the process , '' he said . U.S. officials have said that the collection of oil and gas leaking into the Gulf of Mexico seems to have leveled off for now at about 15,400 barrels a day -- less than half the estimated daily leak . States along the Gulf coast are increasing demands for financial compensation from BP , The Wall Street Journal reported . State officials say they are feeling the effects , both environmentally and financially , and that they need much more than what BP is offering to recover lost wages and taxes . Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum sent a letter to BP requesting that the company deposit $ 2.5 billion into an escrow account to cover potential losses , the Journal reported . Rallies were planned on Saturday in more than 50 cities across five continents in what was dubbed `` Worldwide BP Protest Day . '' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Obama should not be blamed for the spill , according to the advance transcript of a pre-taped interview on Bloomberg TV 's `` Political Capital . '' `` I would give him fairly low marks in terms of responding to the consequences of the spill , but stopping the leak , nobody could do any better , '' Graham said . `` We 're trying everything under the sun to stop the leak , and it 's not his fault that we ca n't find a way to cap it . '' About one-third of Gulf of Mexico federal waters remains closed to fishing , and oil has spread to Florida 's Pensacola and Perdido passes , two gateways to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway . At Perdido Bay , on the border between Florida and Alabama , orange booms were stained with thick brown oil as workers tied absorbent ` pom poms ' to them to prevent the oil seeping further into the waterways . `` We want to make sure areas where there may be nesting , we want to have extra booms in those areas , '' said Alexis Brooks , incident information officer at Gulf Islands National Seashore .

Americans have been taking money from BP for a long time . Sarah Palin 's life style over the years has been paid for by BP . In fact Alaska and Alaskan politicians benefited from BP . For that matter BP deep pockets have paid for much of congresses reelection campaign Democrats Republican for years in one way or the other . It is difficult to defend BP , knowing its safety record . BP has amassed something in the neighborhood of 93 times the number of safety violations than its two closest competitors . If the British want to group themselves with BP , its image , and safety record , that 's up to them . If you break something you pay for it . I 'm not a Britain basher but BP needs to be held accountable for and to pay for any and all costs that have been incurred as a result of this spill . How can any company justify paying dividends when they have such a huge unpaid and un-prearranged liability ? If they ca n't afford to pay it all in one go -LRB- and it sounds like in actual fact they can -RRB- then some sort of payment plan could be worked out for them . However , the payment plan should cover not just cleanup and compensation for current damages but should also include any future lost earnings and any losses attributable to the delay in payment of the compensation itself . The bottom line is that no one should come out of this financially worse off except for BP themselves . This discussion is now closed .

The move comes as Obama , who will address the nation about the spill on Tuesday night , faces questions on his handling of the disaster , which was in its 55th day . Millions of gallons of oil have poured into the Gulf since an April 20 offshore rig blast killed 11 workers and blew out the well . Obama also will call for an independent panel to administer the payments when he meets Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg and other BP officials on Wednesday at the White House . `` We want to make sure that money is escrowed for the legitimate claims , '' White House adviser David Axelrod told NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' adding that the money would be independently administered to ensure it is disbursed in a timely fashion . Fifty-four Democratic Senators want BP to put an initial $ 20 billion payment into an independently-managed account to cover compensation for victims and for clean up . `` Establishment of this account would serve as an act of good faith and as a first step toward ensuring that there will be no delay or attempt to evade responsibility for damages , '' the senators wrote in a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward . They demanded a response by June 18 . On Monday , Obama will make his fourth trip to the Gulf , visiting Alabama , Mississippi and Florida for the first time since the start of the crisis . He will stay overnight there for the first time since then and return to Washington on Tuesday and address the nation at 8 p.m. EDT . `` He wants to lay out the steps we 're going to take from here to get through this crisis , '' Axelrod said . The New York Times was strongly critical of Obama 's leadership on the oil spill in an editorial on Sunday . `` Americans need to know that Mr. Obama , whose coolness can seem like detachment , is engaged , '' the Times wrote , noting the spill raised questions about his `` competence and leadership . '' Some Republican opponents questioned the logic of the president making a televised prime-time speech to the country before meeting with top BP executives on Wednesday . `` That 's a little surprising to me , '' Republican Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi told CBS 's `` Face the Nation '' program about the timing of Obama 's speech . `` If I were , as governor , trying to make sure somebody does something , I would meet with them before I went on television . '' The Obama administration has delayed plans to permit new offshore drilling as a result of the spill . The crisis has put Obama on the defensive and distracted his team from the domestic agenda -- a new energy policy , reform of Wall Street and bolstering a struggling American economy . Mark Tayamen , a Louisiana shrimper idled by the spill , said there is little Obama can say to make him feel better . `` This is our livelihood . It 's where we have fun and teach our kids and grandchildren . There ai n't nothing out there now , '' he said in Venice , preparing to take his boat out to rescue oiled birds and animals , thanks to a contract from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . `` There ai n't nothing -LRB- Obama -RRB- can say . The damage is done . '' People in southern Louisiana are frustrated with BP for the spill but also at Obama 's drilling moratorium because many families have members who work in the oil industry . The focus on America 's biggest environmental disaster comes ahead of November 's congressional elections in which the Democrats are expected to struggle to keep their majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate . U.S. public anger is high as the crisis nears two months and news is marked by images of polluted beaches , oil-covered birds and fishermen anxious about their precarious situation . Democrats want Obama to tap that mood to press for development of alternative energies such as solar and wind power . The United States and Britain played down diplomatic tensions over the crisis . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was up to the British energy giant , under pressure in the United States to suspend its stock dividend to help pay for the damage , to make that decision alone . A source told Reuters on Sunday the company was unlikely to cancel the dividend , currently valued at about $ 10.5 billion annually . The source told Reuters on Sunday that options being considered were deferring the dividend , paying it in shares or paying into a ring-fenced account until liabilities are known and that the issue probably would not be decided this week . BP placed a containment cap on its blown out seabed well this month after a series of failures to stem the flow but oil continues to gush from it , polluting beaches and wildlife habitats , killing marine life and damaging tourism and fishing . The partly contained leak is estimated to flow at up to 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- a day . U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral James Watson told BP in a June 11 letter made public Saturday that its containment plan did not go far enough or include enough back-up measures in the event of equipment failure or other problems . He gave the company two days to come up with a fix . Thad Allen , the U.S. Coast Guard admiral heading the federal relief effort , told CBS he expects BP to present a plan to increase oil capture later on Sunday . U.S. lawmakers have called on Obama to take a harder line with BP , which has lost tens of billions of dollars in market value so far . But senior British officials have warned about the economic impact of destabilizing a company that is a staple holding of British pension funds . In a phone call on Saturday , Obama told British Prime Minister David Cameron he had no interest in undermining the value of BP and the two leaders played down tensions over the oil spill and reaffirmed close ties . Cameron , who took office last month , is under pressure in Britain to do more to protect a company that accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by British companies . On Tuesday , lawmakers hold a hearing in Washington with all the big oil companies including the head of BP 's U.S. operation . On Thursday BP 's Hayward , who is expected to attend Wednesday 's White House meeting , will testify to the U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee . BP expects its cost for the Gulf oil clean-up to be $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion . Many analysts expect a higher cost . States along the Gulf coast are increasingly demanding financial compensation from BP as the spill spreads along their shorelines , slamming tourism and fishing industries . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Apparently they own the politicians . It 's up to us to dissuade these companies from gambling with the our quality of lives for a little extra profit . BP controls the crime scene , BP is now telling us how much the clean up will cost ? If BP knows so much maybe they can bring the eleven men and 10,000 creatures back to life . Or maybe they should stop the leak . Or maybe they should be shown what 's what . As usual , Obama has covered all the bases and done nothing . This surely must be Bush 's fault Blaming Obama for this is precisely as reasonable as blaming the post war government in Germany after World War II for the destruction and economic crisis . This is the result of conservative policies championed by Republicans . No I have a better analogy , its like blaming the police after a rape ! We could have weaned ourselves from oil decades ago but you Conservative Republicans have fought and cut the budget for alternatives every step of the way . Not only that its the Republicans who led the deregulation charge -- well here 's your result , a dead gulf of Mexico . The fact that someone could even make an argument to the contrary shows either a total lack of objective reasoning or a cynical attempt to confuse the ignorant . Have you no shame !

Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum sent a letter to BP on Thursday requesting that the company deposit $ 2.5 billion into an escrow account to cover potential losses , the Journal reported . The spreading spill likely represents `` a staggering blow '' to the state 's economy and already has `` seriously '' hurt local tourism and fishing , McCollum wrote . BP said late Thursday it would give an additional $ 25 million each to Florida , Alabama and Mississippi to help with recovery efforts . It made identical grants to the three states in early May , in addition to a combined $ 55 million grant in mid-May for tourism marketing efforts . Joe Morton , Alabama 's education superintendent , told The Wall Street Journal that he plans to deliver a sizable bill to BP in the coming weeks to cover lost income and sales-tax receipts that contribute 90 percent of the state 's $ 5 billion annual budget for schools . Like most state governments , Alabama 's has been reeling from the impact of the recession on its revenue . `` We 're already down to the bone '' in terms of funding , Morton told the newspaper . The state cut its education budget by 7.5 percent this year , to $ 5.3 billion . Meanwhile , efforts to contain the spill and clean up the oil continued on Saturday . BP has been capturing some of the leaking oil since installing a containment system last week , though the well will not be sealed until August , when two relief wells now being drilled are due to be completed . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Wow , the tourism industry thinks they have a claim because people self-select to vacation elsewhere . Can I get claim money since I no longer can get my weekly oysters in Cincinnati ?

'' Millions of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil have gushed into the Gulf since an April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers and ruptured BP 's well . The spill has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled a multibillion-dollar fishing industry and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . Obama , on his fourth visit to the Gulf Coast since the crisis began , said he would press BP executives at a White House meeting on Wednesday to deal `` justly , fairly and promptly '' with damage claims from the spill . In New York , BP 's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 9.71 percent on investor concern the company may give in to calls by U.S. politicians to suspend its quarterly dividend . In London , BP shares closed down 9.3 percent . Under intense pressure from the Obama administration , BP unveiled a new plan on Monday to vastly boost the amount of oil it is siphoning off from its ruptured well . But the leak will not be permanently sealed until BP finishes two relief wells that are due to be completed in August . BP said it planned to send more vessels to the spill site to increase its capacity to capture oil from 15,000 barrels a day now to 40,000-53 ,000 barrels by the end of this month and 60,000-80 ,000 by mid-July . In a pivotal week in the 56-day-old crisis , Obama began a two-day visit to Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . He will address the nation on Tuesday before meeting the BP executives on Wednesday for what a White House spokesman said would be a `` very frank '' encounter . Ahead of congressional hearings on Tuesday and Thursday , lawmakers Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak released a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward that laid out a potentially damning account of the events leading up to the rig explosion . `` It appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk , '' their letter said . A BP spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment before the hearings . The massive spill has overshadowed Obama 's political agenda , eclipsing job creation and Wall Street reform . Both are key issues in November congressional elections in which Obama 's fellow Democrats are expected to face a tough fight to hold onto their majorities in both houses . Facing intense criticism that he has not shown enough leadership in the spill , Obama will seek to use his meeting with BP executives and his first nationally televised Oval Office speech to show he is on top of the crisis . But Anthony Bourgeois , 62 , a seventh-generation commercial fisherman , said the situation was past the point where Obama 's words could quickly bring a quick solution . `` There ai n't much he can say . We 're all commercial fishermen and we ca n't go out and make a living , '' he said in blazing heat in Venice , Louisiana . BP has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of the cleanup and last week was confronted with a White House threat to widen its liabilities for the disaster . The company has lost more than 40 percent of its market value since the crisis began . `` The concern is that BP is going to cut its dividend and that 's weighing on the stock , '' said Andy Fitzpatrick , director of investments at Hinsdale Associates , in Hinsdale , Illinois . BP has hired investment banks Blackstone Group LP , Goldman Sachs Group LP and Credit Suisse Group AG as advisers , a source familiar with the matter said . The source did not say what role the banks would play . Investment bankers generally advise companies on corporate strategy , including mergers and acquisitions and financings . The spill has created an unprecedented financial , legal , regulatory and environmental crisis for companies that operate in the Gulf of Mexico , Moody 's Investors Service warned in a report on Monday , saying it could be up to two years before oil production reaches pre-spill levels . The Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico posed `` uncertainties that could last well beyond this date for producers , drillers and service companies operating in the region , '' Moody 's said . In his meeting with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg on Wednesday , Obama will press for the company to set up an independently managed fund to pay oil spill damage claims . Speaking in Theodore , Alabama , Obama said the White House was already talking to BP about the fund and hoped agreement on a framework for claims payments would be reached by Wednesday . Gulf Coast residents have been complaining for weeks the BP claims process is too slow and that the money the company is paying out is too little to make ends meet . U.S. politicians have been calling on BP to scrap its quarterly dividend to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay the compensation claims and clean up the spill . BP executives will likely face renewed pressure to do this when they testify to Congress this week . Representatives of BP , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and ConocoPhillips are due to testify on Tuesday and may give the best view yet of how the industry expects the spill to affect it in the long term . But analysts also expect the hearing to be full of drama . `` It 's going to be ugly for BP officials and there 's probably not going to be a lot gained from the experience , '' said Michael Sheldon , chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport , Connecticut . BP 's Hayward will make his first appearance at a congressional hearing on Thursday and is expected to face harsh questioning from lawmakers . As chief executive , Hayward is the public face of BP 's response to the spill and a lightning rod for criticism that the company played down the scale of the disaster to reduce its potential liabilities . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Or is Obama being judge , jury and executioner before any enquiry apportions blame and responsibility ? BP is going to need to sell off its US assets , or roughly 1\\/4 of its daily oil production Talking about `` good faith '' , why not ask all the parties who may be liable to also escrow money . And one of the most dishonest aspects of the federal government is that they hide behind the doctrine of `` sovereign immunity '' unless the government waives it . Obama should ` man up ' and waive federal immunity to show ` good faith ' . Anything less would lead objective Americans to believe that our government is comprised of thugs .

Anadarko owns a 25 percent interest in the well that suffered the blowout on April 20 that caused an explosion at a drilling rig , killing 11 and creating the worst oil spill in U.S. history . The cost of the cleanup could run well into the tens of billions of dollars . While the contracts signed between partners in the development of oil wells call for each company to pay its proportional costs , BP , the operator of the well , could find itself footing the entire cleanup bill if Anadarko can prove the oil giant was negligent in drilling the well . `` The question is : is Anadarko going to be liable for cleanup costs , and I would say that 's the operator 's problem , '' said Michael Jones , adjunct professor of law at the South Texas College of Law . Investors are starting to bet that Anadarko , whose shares have tumbled 43 percent , may not face the financial hit that BP is likely to experience . It shares closed slightly higher on Monday at $ 42 , up about $ 7.50 from a year low on June 9 . `` There is every reason to believe that they will not be on the hook for more than the punitive cost of $ 75 million , '' said Keith Goddard , co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund , referring to statutory liability costs under current law . Goddard , whose firm recently bought 83,752 shares of Anadarko , said he believed the company could likely afford to pay its potential costs from the cleanup but still acknowledged there was a danger . For buyers of Anadarko shares , `` it 's a reasonable risk-reward -- a very low probability of losing it all and a very high probability of making a lot of money in a short period of time , '' Goddard said . Anadarko has said only that it was assessing various remedies around the oil spill and did not comment on potential legal strategies . The company 's role as solely a financial partner rather than as an operator of the well is key , if the issue were to go to trial , one lawyer said . `` Judges will take into account the fact that you have a completely innocent operator , '' Patrick Morris , a lawyer at the firm Johnson & Bell who represents oil companies in rig litigation . `` I think Anadarko 's defense could be pretty good , but it will take a long time '' for the issue to be settled . The potential damage to the company if it is held responsible for a quarter of cleanup costs could be devastating . `` It hurts -LRB- Anadarko -RRB- more pound for pound , inch for inch , than it does for BP . Anything over $ 20 billion total cost is going to hit Anadarko pretty hard , '' said Fadel Gheit , analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. . The odds that Anadarko will not face any liability could be too steep , he said . `` It 's a possibility , but I would n't want to make a bet on it , '' he added . That fear could keep the Anadarko shares under pressure as wary investors seek more clarity into just how expensive the cleanup of the oil from the Gulf and the sensitive coastal shore will be . `` Anadarko is one of my favorite companies on the planet , but I do n't think you can own it until the spill is stopped . Until you can actually stop it , the number just keeps going up , '' said Stephen Davis , associate portfolio manager at Alpine Mutual Funds . That fear and the uncertain impact of regulations that may be implemented by the U.S. government to prevent future accidents have meant that methods typically used by Wall Street to evaluate companies ' stocks have little merit here . `` People thought Anadarko was cheap at $ 70 , $ 60 , $ 50 -LRB- a share -RRB- . This is no longer a valuation call , '' Davis said .

It 's partly political posturing , but there 's a real threat too . Venezuelan-style expropriation may be a stretch , but Uncle Sam could still hurt the British oil giant badly . The typically even-tempered President Barack Obama has talked about finding some `` ass to kick , '' and BP investors , who have sold off the company 's shares sharply , are right to worry . Among the latest ideas aired by U.S. officials are making BP pay oil workers laid off as a result of the broad drilling moratorium imposed by the government , and forcing the company to suspend dividend payments . Some of these proposals test the limits of the law . But Uncle Sam has plenty of real sway over BP . Until its Gulf of Mexico fiasco began nearly two months ago , BP held pole position in America 's oil industry . Building on its late-1990s deals to buy Amoco and Atlantic Richfield , it had become the largest producer in federal waters in the Gulf . With $ 2.2 billion of annual supply contracts , it is also the top fuel supplier to the American military . Citigroup reckons nearly half BP 's value is , or was , attributable to its U.S. business . Stripping BP of existing production leases may be difficult legally . Once the oil starts to flow , these run in perpetuity and have very restricted termination clauses -- though lawyers in Houston are trawling for small print the government might invoke . Perhaps more likely is to use BP 's lamentable safety record to bar it from future U.S. production . While Exxon Mobil got religion on safety after the Valdez disaster 1989 , BP seemingly did not . Even after its lethal 2005 Texas City refinery explosion , two BP refineries accounted for 829 , or 97 percent , of the 851 `` willful '' violations found by government safety inspectors in the U.S. refining industry between June 2007 and February this year , according to the Center for Public Integrity . Then there are those Pentagon contracts , which must be at risk . All this presents a long-term threat beyond the costs related to the current disaster . Despite BP 's financial strength , it may eventually make BP 's U.S. operations , and indeed the whole company , candidates for possible sale -- and associated name changes that just might consign memories of BP , as well as Iran , to the seabed . The BP brand will certainly have to die in North America . Otherwise the US government should pick out a number that they think BP could survive -LRB- without bankruptcy -RRB- . Say it is $ 20 billion . Then set up an escrow account and cap the liability at that amount . Let the administrators of the escrow fund handle the inevitable swindles and lawsuits . Let BP get on with the job of stopping the oil leak and building a new corporate culture . Good presentation of the different choices except one thing that you fail to imagine : the qualification of a crime that could lead to hold BP CEO on the american territory and ask him for the famous caution to prepare freely his defense . Obama is going to make a declaration in some hours . `` There ai n't much he can say . We 're all commercial fishermen and we ca n't go out and make a living , '' he said in blazing heat in Venice , Louisiana . BP has to go . It 's very clear by now that this company cared nothing about the dangers of oil exploration\\/production . Once a hurricane picks up that oil , BP will be responsible for singlehandedly casting a blight across the Gulf states . Perhaps even our eastern coastal states will suffer . I 'm sure it will be the darkest , most unwelcome hurricane anyone has ever seen . And to think that this destruction would be unleashed by a NATO ally . Way to represent your country BP . Get BP out of the picture and let our own expert salvage folks and engineers take over and get the job done . There are many respected Americans in the field that understand the problem and can solve it given the resources . Get them what they need . And get BP out . They are n't doing anything useful anyway . Benny ... where have you been ? US experts and scientists as well as staff from all other major US oil firms are already providing advise to BP . BP has mobilised all its available equipment to stop this leak and to reduce any damage by the already spilt oil . If all these experts have n't already managed it do you think asking BP to leave is going to make it better ? I am sure BP would be quite happy to just leave . It would save them helluva a lot of hassle and money , but , no , they are responsible enough to stick it out there until the damage is reduced as far as possible . One more thing ... what 's the point of having a separate escrow account for claims to be administered by an independent US civil service agency . BP has already been settling all claims on a 48 hr turn around time basis . I doubt any government agency would be that quick !

Ahead of the televised speech , major oil company executives told a U.S. congressional hearing that BP had not adhered to industry standards in building its deep-sea well that blew out on April 20 , unleashing a torrent of crude that has caused the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history . But their efforts to distance themselves from BP did not stop Democratic lawmakers from criticizing as `` virtually worthless '' industry plans to handle deepwater oil disasters . In his first nationally televised address from the Oval Office , Obama will seek to show that he is on top of the oil spill crisis that has tested his presidency and overshadowed his efforts to reduce U.S. unemployment and reform Wall Street . The speech is set for 8 p.m. EDT -LRB- 0001 GMT -RRB- . Public opinion polls show a majority of Americans believe Obama has been too detached in his handling of the spill , and he has come under intense pressure to show more leadership . Adding a fresh sense of urgency , a team of U.S. scientists on Tuesday upped their high-end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from the well by 50 percent , to a range of 35,000 to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million and 2.52 million gallons\\/5 .57 million and 9.54 million liters -RRB- per day . Tuesday night 's address will be closely watched by the oil industry and investors worried about the future of offshore drilling in the United States , in particular the possibility of tighter regulations that could impose new financial costs . Investors also will be looking for Obama to jump-start alternative energy initiatives such as solar , wind and geothermal that are now stalled in Congress . Shares in U.S. solar companies rose ahead of the speech . Obama may use the address to revive energy legislation that has been languishing in the Senate amid opposition from Republicans and lawmakers from oil and coal states . The bill aims to curb global warming and increase domestic energy production . Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , however , warned Obama against using `` the justifiable public outrage over an explosion that killed 11 people and the oil spill that followed as a tool for pushing a divisive new climate change policy . '' Before he spoke , Obama named Michael Bromwich , a former Justice Department official , to lead an overhaul of the Minerals Management Service , the oil-drilling oversight agency that has faced a crescendo of criticism since the spill . Obama vowed that a `` cozy relationship '' between oil companies and their regulators would no longer be tolerated . At Tuesday 's congressional hearing , executives from Exxon Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell declined to answer when one lawmaker asked whether they would disagree that BP had made mistakes in constructing its ill-fated Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico . Representative Edward Markey pushed BP 's U.S. boss , Lamar McKay , to apologize for not being able to accurately estimate the amount of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico . Millions of gallons have poured into the Gulf , fouling 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiling multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries and killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins . Oil gushed unchecked for several hours from the well on Tuesday after a small fire onboard an oil-collecting ship forced a suspension of siphoning operation , but the operation resumed before Obama spoke . `` We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through , we are sorry for that and the spill , '' a drawn-looking McKay said , adding that the company did not have the technology to measure the amount of spilled oil . Laying out the steps that his company was taking to contain the spill , he said BP soon would have up to six ships on the scene to deal with oil siphoned from the spewing well . As McKay was speaking , BP 's U.S.-listed shares jumped and trading volumes spiked . They rose 4 percent at one point in afternoon trading before closing up 2.35 percent . They had plunged 9 percent on Monday . In London , shares of BP , which could face billions of dollars in damage claims from the spill , closed down 3.78 percent on Tuesday . Rating agency Fitch smacked BP with a hefty six-notch downgrade on its debt rating . That puts BP 's debt just two notches above junk , which would mean a significant boost in the company 's cost of borrowing . BP has lost about half of its market value since the spill began two months ago . Bank of America Merrill Lynch has ordered its traders not to enter into oil trades with BP that extend beyond June 2011 , a market source familiar with the directive told Reuters on Tuesday . Ahead of his speech , Obama was in Florida on the second day of a two-day tour of Gulf Coast communities hit by the 57-day-old spill . `` This is an assault on our shores and we 're going to fight back with everything that we 've got , '' Obama said in a speech at the Pensacola Naval Air Station . BP said its new containment cap system had captured 15,420 barrels from its Gulf of Mexico well on Monday . The system has collected 149,900 barrels since it was installed on June 3 . One oil barrel equals 42 U.S. gallons -LRB- 160 liters -RRB- . But thousands of gallons of oil are still pouring into the Gulf every day and a definitive solution is not expected until August , when BP is due to complete drilling two relief wells . It is a critical week for the company -- top executives are due to meet Obama at the White House on Wednesday , when the president will press them to set up a special fund to pay damage claims to victims of the spill . Chief Executive Tony Hayward , the public face of BP 's response to the spill , is due to testify for the first time at a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday .

'' The usually clubby oil industry may fragment in front of Congress as top executives from BP , Exxon Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell argue that deepwater drilling is safe if proper procedure is followed . `` This incident represents a dramatic departure from the industry norm in deepwater drilling , '' Exxon Mobil Chairman and Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said in prepared testimony obtained by Reuters . Millions of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil have gushed into the Gulf since an April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers and ruptured BP 's well . The spill , the biggest in U.S. history , has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries , and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . The massive spill has overshadowed Obama 's political agenda , eclipsing job creation and Wall Street reform . Both are key issues in November congressional elections in which Obama 's fellow Democrats are expected to face a tough fight to hold onto their majorities in both houses . Obama , on his fourth visit to the Gulf Coast since the crisis began , said he would press BP executives at a White House meeting on Wednesday to deal `` justly , fairly and promptly '' with spill damage claims . In New York , BP 's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 9.71 percent on investor concern the company may give in to calls by U.S. politicians to suspend its quarterly dividend . In London , BP shares closed down 9.3 percent . Under intense pressure from the Obama administration , BP unveiled a new plan on Monday to vastly boost the amount of oil it is siphoning off from its ruptured well . BP said it planned to send more vessels to the spill site to increase its capacity to capture oil from 15,000 barrels a day now to 40,000-53 ,000 barrels by the end of this month and 60,000-80 ,000 by mid-July . In a pivotal week in the 56-day-old crisis , Obama began a two-day visit to the Gulf coast . He will address the nation on Tuesday , before he meets BP executives for what a White House spokesman said would be a `` very frank '' encounter on Wednesday . Ahead of the congressional hearings on Tuesday and Thursday , lawmakers Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak released a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward laying out a potentially damning account of the events leading up to the rig explosion . `` It appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk , '' their letter said . A BP spokesman declined to comment before the hearings . Sweat beading his face in the hot weather , Obama on Monday toured fouled beaches and visited businesses laid low by the collapse of tourism . He promised the Gulf would bounce back , urged Americans not to cancel travel plans to the region and said the seafood was safe . In the evening , he sampled crawfish tails and crab claws at a waterside restaurant in Orange Beach , Alabama . The president faces intense criticism that he has not shown enough leadership in the spill and will seek to use his meeting with BP executives and his first nationally televised Oval Office speech to show he is on top of the crisis . But Anthony Bourgeois , 62 , a seventh-generation commercial fisherman , said the situation was past the point where Obama 's words could quickly bring a quick solution . `` There ai n't much he can say . We 're all commercial fishermen and we ca n't go out and make a living , '' Bourgeois said in blazing heat in Venice , Louisiana . Many on the Gulf Coast are torn between support for the oil industry , an economic mainstay , and anger . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said the coast was in a `` war to stop this oil '' but also asked Obama to put a quick end to a drilling moratorium . BP has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of the cleanup and last week was confronted with a White House threat to widen its liabilities for the disaster . The company has lost more than 40 percent of its market value since the crisis began . `` The concern is that BP is going to cut its dividend and that 's weighing on the stock , '' said Andy Fitzpatrick , director of investments at Hinsdale Associates , in Hinsdale , Illinois . BP has hired investment banks Blackstone Group LP , Goldman Sachs Group and Credit Suisse Group as advisers , a source familiar with the matter said , without disclosing the purpose of the move . The spill has created an unprecedented financial , legal , regulatory and environmental crisis for companies that operate in the Gulf , Moody 's Investors Service warned in a report on Monday , saying it could be up to two years before oil production reaches pre-spill levels and that a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling posed many uncertainties . Obama announced the final five people he wants to join a commission to make recommendations for the future of offshore drilling -- all environmentalists and academics with no clear representative of the oil industry . In his meeting with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg on Wednesday , Obama will press for the company to set up an independently managed fund to pay oil spill damage claims . Speaking in Theodore , Alabama , Obama said the White House was already talking to BP about the fund and hoped agreement on a framework for claims payments would be reached by Wednesday . Gulf Coast residents have been complaining for weeks the BP claims process is too slow and that the money the company is paying out is too little to make ends meet . U.S. politicians have been calling on BP to scrap its quarterly dividend to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay the compensation claims and clean up the spill .

WASHINGTON | Tue Jun 15 , 2010 4:39 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. lawmakers blasted major oil companies on Tuesday for `` virtually worthless '' and `` cookie cutter '' plans to handle a deepwater oil disaster , with one top executive conceding the industry was ill prepared to handle big offshore spills . Summoned to Capitol Hill to testify along with the U.S. chief of BP , top executives from four major oil companies distanced themselves from BP and its massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill by defending their practices and explaining how they could have prevented the catastrophe . Facing a hostile room , the oil company executives were hoping to head off potentially costly new regulations by detailing their drilling policies and criticizing BP for not following industry norms . Democrat Edward Markey blasted the companies for mentioning walruses -- which have not been found in the Gulf of Mexico for millions of years -- in their plans and for including the name and phone number of a specialist who died in 2005 . The outcome of the charged hearing could affect BP , U.S. offshore drilling and legislative efforts to introduce a new climate bill , as lawmakers consider options to address the worst oil spill in U.S. history . The hearing came ahead of a televised address to the nation on Tuesday evening by President Barack Obama , who could outline new efforts to contain the spill and make a new call for climate legislation . Polls show many Americans doubt his administration has done enough to clean up the mess . Soon after the deadly BP well explosion that killed 11 people , the Obama administration imposed a six-month moratorium on drilling in waters more than 500 feet deep . The executives from Exxon Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell , are trying to reassure lawmakers that drilling is safe , saying they would have done things differently with such a spill . But when pressed on how to handle a worst-case scenario with hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil spilling into the ocean , Exxon 's chief Rex Tillerson said , `` When these things happen we are not well equipped to deal with them . '' `` We 've never represented anything different than that . That 's why emphasis is always on preventing these things from occurring , because when they happen we are not very well equipped to deal with them , '' Tillerson said . Lawmakers seemed unconvinced that the four major oil companies had better contingency plans than BP , which is still struggling to contain the oil that has been gushing into the ocean from a ruptured well for nearly two months . The hearing could lead to new legislation that would have wide impact in the U.S. Gulf , America 's best hope for increasing its domestic oil supply . It 's also one of the most promising exploration frontiers for companies including BP , Shell and Chevron . One by one the lawmakers took turns heaping criticism on the oil executives who sat expressionless as they stared facing rows of their inquisitors . `` Lawmakers won , no question . As soon as the companies were asked why they were better , it ended up making them all look worse in the eyes of the lawmakers , '' said Kevin Book , analyst at ClearView Energy Partners in Washington . Though all five men were seated at the same large table , it was clearly four against one with BP America 's chief Lamar McKay looking solitary at the end of the table as he faced most of the verbal attacks . While McKay silently listened to Republican Representative Cliff Stearns of Florida demand his resignation , the other executives had only to defend their policies and insist that they would have done it differently . McKay , who appeared drawn but showed little emotion , did not offer much new ahead of Thursday 's testimony by BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , on Capitol Hill . Though Wall Street investors shrugged off the hearing as political theater , it is a tradition in Washington and a conduit of public anger , especially ahead of November elections . Representative Bart Stupak , a Democrat and one of the lawmakers heading a probe of the disaster , slammed the companies ' response plans for offshore accidents . He singled out Exxon Mobil for having a 40-page media response strategy , including pre-written talking points . `` Exxon Mobil 's plan appears more concerned about public perception than wildlife protection given the fact that their media plan is fives times longer than its plan for protecting wildlife , '' said Stupak , adding that all of the companies ' plans were `` virtually worthless when an actual spill occurs . '' Representative Henry Waxman , a Democrat , said the companies had submitted nearly identical `` cookie cutter '' strategies to deal with a major spill which all included techniques that had failed to stem the flow of oil from BP 's well . `` We found that none of the five companies has an adequate plan , '' he said . BP 's McKay was emotionless when repeatedly asked by Markey to apologize for under-estimating how much oil was gushing into the ocean after the well ruptured . `` We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through , we are sorry for that and the spill , '' he said , adding that the company did not have the technology to measure the amount of spilled oil . But though the four non-BP executives appeared to stick together , chatting apart from McKay when the hearing ended , they still had to face public anger . As the hearing came to a close , a protester holding a soda bottle filled with a black liquid approached the executives shouting , `` You all are just as corrupt as BP . You should all be ashamed of yourself . '' Police presence was beefed up , with the building and hearing room entrances both inside and outside lined with police officers .

With all this scrutiny they know it is only a matter of time until someone actually looks at what they do and not what they say . We will buy them , I promise you .

If you want things to change -LRB- for the better -RRB- , look beyond this fiasco and start spreading the word every where you go and everywhere you type . So typical of the Obama administration , summoning the heads of the oil companies to be attacked by strutting politicians trolling for votes back home come November . I 've seen this show before , first with the auto execs , then the big bank execs , now the oil company execs . The ritual prostration before these know-nothing politicians is , frankly , appalling .

That is a significant jump from the last estimate issued by the Flow Rate Technical Group on June 10 and pegging the well 's flow at 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day . And those figures were considerably higher than the previous `` best estimate '' of 12,000-19 ,000 bpd issued by the flow rate group on May 27 . `` This estimate brings together several scientific methodologies and the latest information from the sea floor , and represents a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil that is escaping from BP 's well , '' said Energy Secretary Steven Chu . The team of scientists said they may revise the estimates again as they gather new data on the well , one mile beneath the ocean surface . Even at the minimum estimated rate of 35,000 bpd , the ruptured well has dumped nearly 2 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 -- nearly eight times the amount that the Exxon Valdez spilled into Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989 . At the U.S. government 's direction , BP is boosting its oil capturing capacity to up to 53,000 bpd by the end of June and to 80,000 bpd by mid-July from about 18,000 bpd . The new estimates come from detailed pressure data taken by instruments inside BP 's oil-containment device on the sea floor over the last 24 hours , the government said . `` This estimate , which we will continue to refine as the scientific teams get new data and conduct new analyses , is the most comprehensive estimate so far of how much oil is flowing one mile below the ocean 's surface , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement .

The order to the bank 's traders came from a high-level executive and was made on Monday , according to a source familiar with it . It told traders not to engage in trade with BP for contracts beyond one year from this month . The directive did n't state a reason for the limit on longer-duration trades with the oil company , which comes as the British oil giant scrambles to stop an oil spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which it could eventually face billions of dollars in economic liabilities . Limiting the duration of trades with a counterparty is one way in which banks can seek to protect themselves against risk that a company will be unable to meet its long-term obligations . A BofA spokesman declined comment . BP spokesman Toby Odone said the company does n't comment on market rumors or speculation . The company 's U.S.-traded shares -LRB- BP . N -RRB- , which have plummeted around 47 percent since the disaster , rose 2.4 percent on Wall Street during Tuesday trading , then fell after the closing bell . At 5:45 p.m. EDT -LRB- 2145 GMT -RRB- , BP 's shares traded at $ 30.66 , after closing at $ 31.40 . Also after hours , a team of scientists appointed by the government to assess the flow-rate of the BP spill in the Gulf , boosted its estimate to as much as 60,000 barrels per day . A source familiar with BP 's trading operations said they have not been curtailed since the oil spill in April . BP was n't informed of any new trading limits with BofA , which is a relatively small player in oil markets and not among BP 's top trading counterparties , the source said . The source familiar with the BofA directive said it reflects a cautionary stance toward trading with BP . However , the directive did not reference any reduction in overall credit volume the bank would extend to BP . BP 's credit rating was downgraded six notches on Tuesday by Fitch Ratings , which cited the high costs BP may face for compensating victims of the company 's Gulf spill . Fitch downgraded BP to BBB from an AA rating . A source familiar with the BofA directive said it could include any trades in physical commodities , derivatives and swaps for crude oil and products . The British energy giant ranks among the world 's top oil producers and traders in physical energy markets and derivatives . BP 's Macondo well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continues to spill oil into the Gulf after deadly explosions sank the Transocean Horizon rig in late April . The potential for soaring liabilities related to clean up costs , economic damages and legal penalties that BP could face after the Gulf spill has led some analysts and bankers to speculate that the oil giant may throttle back its trading operations . Several fuel oil traders have recently resigned from BP , including four traders from its Singapore office last week , industry sources told Reuters . Banks typically require companies like BP to put up collateral to back trades in the private derivatives market , though for highly rated firms such as BP , the collateral may be a small portion of the size of the exposure . BP 's credit default swap costs have surged in the past two months on increasing concerns over the company 's credit worthiness , and traders and analysts have said some of the increase has come from banks hedging exposure to the oil company . Credit default swaps are used to protect against the risks of a company or other borrower defaulting on its obligations , or to speculate on its credit quality . BP 's five-year CDS costs have jumped to 515 basis points , or $ 515,000 per year to insure $ 10 million for five years , from around 40 basis points in April , according to Markit Intraday .

The commitments , outlined in a statement on Wednesday , are harsher penalties than most investors had expected and follow BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg 's meeting with President Obama on Wednesday . BP said it would cancel the previously declared first-quarter dividend scheduled for payment on June 21 , and said no interim dividends will be declared for the second and third quarters of 2010 . The payouts had been expected to be about $ 2.6 billion per quarter , in line with recent quarters . Investors had expected the suspension of BP 's dividend , or payment in shares for a couple of quarters , and had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment by 10 percent in 2010 and 2011 -- moves that will curb BP 's growth . When quizzed by analysts on a conference call about what BP had received in return for such major concessions , Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote said the agreement reflected the rising anger toward BP . '' -LRB- It -RRB- will certainly allow us to progress our business more effectively than would have otherwise been the case , '' he said . The decisions to cut investment and sell assets come despite the fact BP is committed to putting only $ 5 billion this year into the new fund , which will be administered by a body independent from BP . The company said it would generate over $ 30 billion from operations this year , while it also has massive credit lines . In 2011 and beyond , BP will make payments into the fund of $ 1.25 billion per quarter , until the fund amounts to $ 20 billion . Grote said the $ 20 billion was not a cap on BP 's liability , but that he expected it would cover the bulk of claims . Until $ 20 billion has been added to the fund , BP 's commitments will be assured by the setting aside of U.S. assets with a value of $ 20 billion , the company said . U.S.-listed BP shares finished 46 cents higher , or 1.5 percent , at $ 31.85 on the New York Stock Exchange . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin ; Editing by Doina Chiacu , Gary Hill -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

As we speak , our nation faces a multitude of challenges . At home , our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American . Abroad , our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists . And tonight , I 've returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we 're waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens . On April 20th , an explosion ripped through BP 's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , about forty miles off the coast of Louisiana . Eleven workers lost their lives . Seventeen others were injured . And soon , nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean , oil began spewing into the water . Because there has never been a leak of this size at this depth , stopping it has tested the limits of human technology . That is why just after the rig sank , I assembled a team of our nation 's best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge '' a team led by Dr. Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and our nation 's Secretary of Energy . Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice . As a result of these efforts , we have directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology . In the coming days and weeks , these efforts should capture up to 90 % of the oil leaking out of the well . This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely . Already , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced . And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it is not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days . The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . But make no mistake : we will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes . We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . And we will do whatever 's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . Tonight I 'd like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward : what we 're doing to clean up the oil , what we 're doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf , and what we 're doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again . First , the cleanup . From the very beginning of this crisis , the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation 's history an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen , who has almost forty years of experience responding to disasters . We now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and cleanup the oil . Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf . And I have authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast . These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore , clean beaches , train response workers , or even help with processing claims and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible . Because of our efforts , millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning , skimming , and other collection methods . Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil . We have approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try and stop the oil before it reaches the shore , and we are working with Alabama , Mississippi , and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines . As the clean up continues , we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need . Now , a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect , and new challenges will always arise . I saw and heard evidence of that during this trip . So if something is n't working , we want to hear about it . If there are problems in the operation , we will fix them . But we have to recognize that despite our best efforts , oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife . And sadly , no matter how effective our response becomes , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . That 's why the second thing we 're focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast . You know , for generations , men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water . That living is now in jeopardy . I 've talked to shrimpers and fishermen who do n't know how they 're going to support their families this year . I 've seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected . I 've talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists will start to come back . The sadness and anger they feel is not just about the money they 've lost . It 's about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost . I refuse to let that happen . Tomorrow , I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company 's recklessness . And this fund will not be controlled by BP . In order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner , the account must and will be administered by an independent , third party . Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short-term , it 's also clear we need a long-term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region . The oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that has already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats . And the region still has n't recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . That 's why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment . I make that commitment tonight . Earlier , I asked Ray Mabus , the Secretary of the Navy , a former governor of Mississippi , and a son of the Gulf , to develop a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible . The plan will be designed by states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists , and other Gulf residents . And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region . The third part of our response plan is the steps we 're taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again . A few months ago , I approved a proposal to consider new , limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken . That was obviously not the case on the Deepwater Horizon rig , and I want to know why . The American people deserve to know why . The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion these families deserve to know why . And so I have established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place . Already , I have issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling . I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs , but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue . And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible , I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially . One place we have already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits , known as the Minerals Management Service . Over the last decade , this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves . At this agency , industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight . Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors , and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations . When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior , one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency . But it 's now clear that the problems there ran much deeper , and the pace of reform was just too slow . And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency Michael Bromwich , who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General . His charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry 's watchdog not its partner . One of the lessons we 've learned from this spill is that we need better regulations better safety standards , and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling . But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry , drilling for oil these days entails greater risk . After all , oil is a finite resource . We consume more than 20 % of the world 's oil , but have less than 2 % of the world 's oil reserves . And that 's part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean because we 're running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water . For decades , we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered . For decades , we have talked and talked about the need to end America 's century-long addiction to fossil fuels . And for decades , we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires . Time and again , the path forward has been blocked not only by oil industry lobbyists , but also by a lack of political courage and candor . The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight . Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be here in America . Each day , we send nearly $ 1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil . And today , as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude . We can not consign our children to this future . The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now . Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash American innovation and seize control of our own destiny . This is not some distant vision for America . The transition away from fossil fuels will take some time , but over the last year and a half , we have already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry . As we speak , old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines , people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows , and small businesses are making solar panels . Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks , and families are making their homes more energy-efficient . Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that will someday lead to entire new industries . Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us . As we recover from this recession , the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of good , middle-class jobs but only if we accelerate that transition . Only if we seize the moment . And only if we rally together and act as one nation workers and entrepreneurs ; scientists and citizens ; the public and private sectors . When I was a candidate for this office , I laid out a set of principles that would move our country toward energy independence . Last year , the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America 's businesses . Now , there are costs associated with this transition . And some believe we ca n't afford those costs right now . I say we ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy because the long-term costs to our economy , our national security , and our environment are far greater . So I am happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels . Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks . Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power . Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high-tech industry does on research and development and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development . All of these approaches have merit , and deserve a fear hearing in the months ahead . But the one approach I will not accept is inaction . The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is too big and too difficult to meet . You see , the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War II . The same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon . And yet , time and again , we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom . Instead , what has defined us as a nation since our founding is our capacity to shape our destiny our determination to fight for the America we want for our children . Even if we 're unsure exactly what that looks like . Even if we do n't yet know precisely how to get there . We know we 'll get there . It is a faith in the future that sustains us as a people . It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now . Each year , at the beginning of shrimping season , the region 's fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe . It 's called `` The Blessing of the Fleet , '' and today it 's a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea some for weeks at a time . The ceremony goes on in good times and in bad . It took place after Katrina , and it took place a few weeks ago at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced . And still , they came and they prayed . For as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition , `` The blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers . The blessing is that He is with us always , '' a blessing that 's granted `` even in the midst of the storm . '' The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face . This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again . What sees us through -- what has always seen us through -- is our strength , our resilience , and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it . Tonight , we pray for that courage . We pray for the people of the Gulf . And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm toward a brighter day .

Reuters looked at possible scenarios for BP earlier this month . The following is an updated look at what might be in store for the London-based oil major , whose shares now stand 45 percent below the pre-blow out levels . BP RUNS OUT OF CASH - UNLIKELY BP says it has spent $ 1.6 billion so far to cap the leaking well and clean up the spill and estimated last week it would spend $ 3 - $ 6 billion in total this year . The company generated cash of $ 7.7 billion from operating activities in the first quarter . Even after capital investment of $ 3.8 billion , it had $ 3.9 billion of free cash and the company says it has arranged significant credit lines . Compensation to those affected by the spill has risen to $ 62 million but could grow sharply as President Barack Obama wants BP to establish an independent fund to pay damages . The annual economic loss of tourism and fishing revenues in the states of Alabama , Louisiana and Mississippi could result in claims as high as $ 10.3 billion , while a reduction of one third in Florida 's tourism industry could add another $ 12 billion to the bill , analysts at Citigroup said . BP 's partners in the well , Anadarko Petroleum and Japan 's Mitusi , have not said whether they will help with compensation . They are legally bound to pay on the basis of their 25 percent and 10 percent respective stakes in the field . The upper end of analysts ' forecasts of total costs is around $ 30 - $ 35 billion , with potential extra costs for lost fisheries business in years to come . Analysts say BP may not be able to cover such costs , and pay its dividend , out of cashflow alone , forcing additional borrowing . However , the oil giant is believed to be able to do so without bringing its gearing levels above its targeted 20-30 percent range . One key risk is that the Administration has said it wants BP to compensate those workers laid off due to the moratorium on deepwater drilling imposed in the wake of the accident -- a cost BP thinks it should not have to pay . So far few , if any , workers have been laid off as oil companies have , with a few exceptions including Anadarko , have not invoked force majeure clauses that allow them cancel rig contracts . Analysts at Raymond James & Associates said in a report on Monday that about 49,500 direct jobs are at risk from the moratorium . BP BECOMES A TAKEOVER TARGET - UNLIKELY Speculation that BP could become a takeover target has been heightened in recent days by news the company had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs as an advisor . Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and France 's Total are the only fully publicly traded oil companies larger than BP and deemed financially strong enough to buy it . Total 's Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie said it would be `` unethical '' to make an approach and analysts think the CEOs of the other companies would also be reluctant to bid . Regulators could force the sale of U.S. refineries into an uncertain market for such assets and the sale of valuable U.S. gas fields , threatening the upside of a deal . However , the biggest deterrent is the open-ended nature of BP 's liabilities . A potential suitor would also fear reputational contamination , analysts said . A takeover by a state-backed entity like one of the Chinese oil companies is inconceivable , analysts said , as BP is the U.S. 's biggest oil producer and given the blocking of the sale of U.S. listed and Asia-focused Unocal to a Chinese company . CEO HAYWARD LOSES HIS JOB - UNLIKELY , FOR NOW Tony Hayward has been a target for highly personal attacks in the United States over some poorly chosen comments . Obama said he would fire Hayward if the CEO worked for him . Analysts and investors have been kinder , taking the view that the accident reflects the intrinsically risky nature of oil exploration . They say BP has done all that could be done to stem the leak and to compensate those affected . BP 's Chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg has also backed Hayward . However , this support could begin to unravel if accusations by U.S. lawmakers -- that BP took shortcuts when drilling the blown out well -- stick . Hayward took up his role promising to standardize and streamline the way BP builds facilities and drills oil wells . If the structures he put in place appear to have led to decisions that contributed to the accident , the CEO 's position could come under pressure . The CEOs of Chevron and Exxon implicitly criticized BP 's practices in testimony to a congressional hearing on Tuesday . Bookmaker Paddy Power is offering odds on Hayward 's departure by December 31 that suggest punters think it is more likely the CEO will go . CHAIRMAN LOSES HIS JOB - UNLIKELY , FOR NOW Svanberg has been criticized by investors and several British newspapers for his low profile in the response effort . His behavior has been contrasted with the high-profile approach taken by predecessor Peter Sutherland , nicknamed by Hayward as BP 's `` tank , '' when forcing former CEO John Browne to name a retirement date and defending BP 's Russian interests in a dispute with Russian partners . BP says it was a deliberate strategy to make Hayward the public face of the company to avoid confusing the public . But other executives , including Americas Director Bob Dudley and U.S. Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles -- both Americans -- have also fronted the response operation in TV interviews . Critics say Svanberg 's low profile reflects his lack of high-level experience of the United States and his personality . But BP found it difficult to replace Sutherland so investors may be reluctant to embark on another chairman hunt with Svanberg in the job less than a year . The chairman meets Obama on Wednesday to discuss proposals to create an independent fund for compensating those affected . A polished performance from the former CEO of Sweden 's Ericsson could help solidify his position . BP TO LOSE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS - LIKELY , BUT IMPACT MINOR Under federal law BP would be banned from government contracts for a period if convicted of a criminal offence under the Clean Water Act . It could also be barred from contracts if found guilty of violating environmental laws . The company has multi-billion dollar contracts to supply fuel to government departments such as the military . However , the government would have to weigh the impact of such a move . For example , it may have difficulty finding alternative suppliers in locations like Afghanistan . Also , selling fuel is one of the lowest margin businesses oil companies operate . Much more money is made from pumping oil from the ground and even if the government does n't buy BP 's Jet fuel or gasoline , others will . So the absolute value of contracts affected may not be material to BP . BP TO FACE GROWTH HEADWINDS IN THE FUTURE - LIKELY BP 's targets for expanded production will become tougher to achieve and its financial performance will suffer from higher costs -- even after spill costs and fines are paid . BP said earlier this year it was targeting oil and gas output growth of 1-2 percent over the medium term . This plan relies heavily on BP 's U.S. projects and especially the Gulf of Mexico , where it was leading the push into ever-deeper waters . The effort to cap the Macondo well is diverting manpower , assets and management time that should be directed toward achieving the company 's targets . Even when the oil spill has been dealt with and the drilling moratorium is lifted , BP 's damaged reputation is likely to mean more scrutiny from regulators than other companies , analysts said . This means it will likely take longer than it would have expected in the past to bring fields to production . Some commentators have called on BP to have its licenses removed . BP TO FACE FINES AND PENALTIES - LIKELY BP faces potential fines under several anti-pollution laws and the recent increases in the estimate of how much oil is leaking from its well suggest this could amount to a major liability . The company has already clocked up potential fines of up to $ 9 billion , based on a possible $ 4,300 per barrel fine for polluting major waterways . With tens of thousands of barrels of oil leaking each day , the fines are still mounting . However , it is unclear whether the government will seek the maximum fines or whether it will offset money spent remediating the damage when setting fines .

The deal gave Obama his most tangible success since the crisis began 58 days ago and came after weeks of criticism of his handling of the disaster . It also eased U.S. pressure on BP , whose share price has withered amid uncertainty over the spill 's cost to the British energy giant . Obama announced the agreement after White House officials held four hours of talks with BP executives , who emerged to offer an apology to the American people for the worst oil spill in U.S. history . `` I do thank you for the patience that you have during this difficult time , '' BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said . `` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies who do n't care . But that is not the case in BP . We care about the small people . '' Svanberg promised to make sure damage claims are handled swiftly and fairly . Chief Executive Tony Hayward , the public face of BP 's response to the disaster , will appear on Thursday at a congressional hearing where he will face intense scrutiny over events leading up to the spill and BP 's cleanup of the mess . An April 20 explosion on an offshore rig leased by BP killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep-sea well . The ensuing spill has fouled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . While Obama stressed the agreement would not cap BP 's total liabilities , Wall Street appeared to cheer the small dose of clarity the deal provided , driving up the company 's share price by 1.5 percent in New York . Under the agreement , BP committed to pay $ 20 billion into an independently managed fund over four years , suspend dividend payments for the rest of the year and pay $ 100 million to workers idled by the six-month moratorium on deep-sea drilling that the Obama administration imposed after the spill . The $ 20 billion figure is roughly equal to BP 's average annual profits over the past four years . `` We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable , '' Obama said at the White House . `` And I 'm absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people . '' The fund will be administered by Kenneth Feinberg , the Obama administration official who oversaw compensation for executives at companies that received federal bailout funds . Obama had pressed BP to set up a fund administered by a third party after hearing first-hand complaints from Gulf Coast residents that BP 's claims process was too complicated and the company was paying out too little money . With thousands of Gulf Coast commercial fishermen largely idled by the spill , Louisiana shrimper Clifton Bartholomew , 21 , wondered whether $ 20 billion would be enough . `` If you add it all up together -- everybody in shrimping , fishing , the whole industry -- by the time this is all gone I think they 'll need more than $ 20 billion , '' Bartholomew said . BP said in a statement it would cut three quarters of dividends , significantly reduce its investment program and sell $ 10 billion of assets to create the fund . The commitments are harsher penalties than most investors had hoped for . They had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment -- moves that would curb its growth . BP said it would cancel the first-quarter dividend due for payment on June 21 and would not declare interim dividends for the second and third quarters of 2010 . The payouts were expected to be about $ 2.6 billion per quarter , in line with recent quarters . Obama stressed BP was `` a strong and viable company , and it is in all of our interests that it remain so . '' The oil giant represents a large part of investment portfolios in Britain . Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron talked about the issues around the spill last weekend . BP 's shares gyrated in volatile New York trading , dropping as much as 5 percent before swinging to positive territory on news of the agreement on the fund , known as an escrow account . `` It 's a step in the right direction for BP but unfortunately I can not say the same for Tony Hayward because it is going to get tougher for him , '' said Fadel Gheit , managing director of oil and gas research at investment firm Oppenheimer & Co in New York `` Tomorrow he 's going to be in the hot seat under glaring lights and tremendous animosity and criticism '' at the hearing . The BP chief executive will tell lawmakers the entire oil and natural gas industry needs to be better prepared for deepwater accidents , according to his prepared testimony . That is an apparent response to attempts by rival oil companies to distance themselves from BP 's disaster at a hearing on Tuesday . As BP stock saw some relief , shares in Anadarko fell 3.69 percent and Transocean lost 3.09 percent in New York . Anadarko is part owner of the blown-out well and Transocean owned the rig that blew up . Back in the Gulf , BP said it started a second system to siphon oil from the leak on Wednesday , a day after a team of U.S. scientists raised their high-end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from the well by 50 percent to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day .

WASHINGTON | Thu Jun 17 , 2010 5:45 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Lawmakers accused BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward of evasion and ducking responsibility for the worst oil spill in U.S. history when he appeared before them on Thursday to answer charges his company cut corners on its blown-out Gulf of Mexico well . In his first appearance before Congress since the start of the 59-day-old crisis , a tired-looking Hayward sat alone at the witness table as lawmakers took turns during more than three hours of questioning to lambaste the British energy giant . `` Under your leadership BP has taken the most extreme risks , '' Democratic lawmaker Henry Waxman told Hayward , who sat impassively during the lawmakers ' barrage . `` BP cut corner after corner to save a million dollars here and a few hours or days there , '' Waxman said , his comments reflecting public anger over BP 's handling of the crisis . Hayward , a 53-year-old geologist with a reputation for blunt speaking , kept largely to a well-rehearsed brief and repeatedly declined to go into detail pending the results of investigations into the spill . He said it was too early to conclude the company had cut corners . Waxman snapped back , saying , `` You are not taking responsibility . You are kicking the can down the road . '' Several lawmakers grew visibly annoyed by Hayward 's answers , accusing him of evasion and telling him they were less interested in his expressions of regret and more concerned about finding out what had gone wrong . The Briton said he had seen no evidence of reckless behavior and repeatedly said he was not involved in the decision-making about the methods used to dig the well . `` I am not stonewalling , '' Hayward said at one point . Hayward 's careful replies may have been a reflection of the fact that company still faces a criminal investigation and lawsuits that could lead to it paying out billions of dollars . Investors welcomed the deal BP reached with the White House on Wednesday setting up a $ 20-billion fund for compensation claims arising from the spill . It gave them a clearer picture for the first time of the potential costs facing BP . But equity analysts and credit ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded BP on Thursday , citing growing liabilities and the White House deal as a competitive disadvantage . BP might try to sell $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in bonds next week -- not because it needs the money but to boost investors ' confidence by showing it can pull off a big deal even amid the political storm , CNBC reported . BP declined to comment on the report . Hayward 's opening statement to the hearing , in which he said he was `` deeply sorry '' for the spill , was interrupted by a protester with her hands painted black and who yelled , `` You need to be charged with a crime , Tony . You need to go to jail . '' She was hustled out of the chamber by police . Hayward told lawmakers BP was doing everything possible to contain the spill . It was triggered by an explosion on an offshore rig on April 20 that killed 11 workers and ruptured its well , unleashing a torrent of crude into the Gulf . The Obama administration 's point man for the disaster , Admiral Thad Allen , told reporters BP was ahead of schedule in drilling a relief well to permanently cap the blown-out well . But he said he could not guarantee it would be finished before its scheduled completion date in August . The spill has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , threatened multibillion dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , dolphins and other sea life . Lawmakers have said BP ignored warnings from contractors and their own employees and chose faster and cheaper drilling options that increased the danger of the well rupturing . Executives from other major oil companies distanced themselves from BP at an earlier congressional hearing this week , saying BP had failed to adhere to industry standards in the construction of its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico . Under harsh questioning from lawmakers on Thursday , Hayward urged them to await the outcome of an investigation into the spill and defended his three years as CEO . He said he had made dramatic safety improvements but conceded more could be done . As he spoke , a live video feed on BP 's website showed black crude continuing to gush into the Gulf from under a containment cap that has been placed on top of the leak to try to siphon off the oil and channel to a ship on the surface above . Environmentalists worried that the political theater playing out on Capitol Hill was taking the focus off the disaster confronting Gulf Coast communities . `` This oil is already into the wetlands and more is coming up every day . You can not clean it out of there . The impact of the spill are going to be felt for decades , '' John Hocevar , a marine biologist with Greenpeace , told Reuters in Louisiana . During Thursday 's hearing , Republican congressman Joe Barton of Texas , the biggest recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions , stunned fellow lawmakers when he apologized to Hayward for the $ 20 billion escrow account the White House pressured the company to agree to . `` I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion , that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown , a $ 20 billion shakedown . '' Hours later , Barton retracted his statement , after Vice President Joe Biden condemned the comments as `` outrageous '' and Republican leaders of the House of Representatives issued a joint statement denouncing them . In London , the company 's stock closed up nearly 7 percent , catching up with gains notched in the U.S.-listed shares on Wednesday after BP 's deal with the Obama administration gave investors enough clarity on liabilities to offset disappointment about a suspended dividend . The stock lost some of those gains in New York trading , dropping about 1 percent as lawmakers questioned Hayward . `` Investors need to think of it as a speculative investment at this point , '' Brian Youngberg , energy analyst at investment firm Edward Jones said of BP 's shares . `` You 're getting no income , and you 're hoping things go better . '' Financial analysts BofA Merrill Lynch and Seymour Pierce downgraded BP from their top ratings following the announcement about the escrow account . While Hayward was testifying in Washington , BP continued to siphon off oil from its ruptured well in the Gulf . BP is boosting its oil-containment effort after activating a new oil-burning system on Wednesday . Siphoning capacity will hit 28,000 barrels per day `` early next week , '' versus the 18,600 barrels that BP trapped on Wednesday , Allen said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . This will not fix everything BP has screwed up or the devastation this has caused and will continue to cause for years to come . They should have been fined a billion dollars a day from day 1 !!!!! Paragraph 3 , `` little people '' ! Sell BP and see how soon Mr. Svanberg becomes `` small '' ! Coming from goverment , that is a shocker ! Of course they will need more ! I am certain there will be claims of `` emotional damage '' from people who saw oil on a beach . Does anyone want to bet we will see claims from people who do not even live within 5000 miles of the gulf of Mexico ? This discussion is now closed .

The bad news : it could create yet another public relations headache for the beleaguered oil giant . Under pressure from the Obama administration , BP acquiesced on Wednesday to fork over $ 20 billion for a fund to pay damages to individuals and businesses harmed by the massive leak still gushing at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . Tax experts say it would be natural for BP to deduct the costs paid out under the fund . Indeed , they have a duty to shareholders to maximize the firm 's value . `` Corporations have liabilities all the time for damages and they are deductible either as a loss or a business expense ; it happens all the time , '' said Walker Johnson , partner at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington , D.C. Exxon did the same thing after its oil disaster over two decades ago but was criticized for it . The final costs to Exxon shareholders from the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker disaster were less than the headline cleanup figures , as many costs were deductible . But Boeing Co decided to forego seeking a tax deduction for any of a $ 615 million settlement with the government in 2006 over ethics charges , under pressure from lawmakers . `` The company 's goal is going to be write off as much as possible , '' Edward McNally , a lawyer at Kasowitz , Benson , and a former U.S. prosecutor who headed the criminal division in Alaska during the Exxon Valdez litigation . `` On the other hand , we live in a representative democracy and people are very adverse to the idea that a large corporation gets ` special tax breaks ' as a result of paying us what they owe us for their own missteps , '' McNally added . BP was not available for comment on whether it would take a tax deduction for the fund . Under the plan , a new independent claims process will be set up to pay for damages to people and businesses . BP has agreed to contribute $ 20 billion over a four-year period at a rate of $ 5 billion per year , including $ 5 billion this year . BP will provide assurance for these commitments by setting aside $ 20 billion in U.S. assets . Asked whether the tax issue came up during the negotiations for the escrow fund , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters it did not , and he was unsure whether it would be part of the discussion as they work out the final terms of the fund . Frank O'Donnell , president of the advocacy group Clean Air Watch , said there would likely be a swift negative reaction from the public and lawmakers if the escrow fund proves to be a tax writeoff . `` I think that the American public would be justifiably outraged to realize it is subsidizing this horror show , '' O'Donnell said . He also said lawmakers are under pressure to craft a legislative response to the oil spill , and the tax deductibility issue would be a leading issue on the agenda . WHICH SIDE OF THE FENCE ? To be sure , BP will likely not be able to deduct everything , including penalties and any fines for crimes . `` Expenses that are penalties , that are designed to punish , to deter future wrongdoing , those most likely ... would not be tax deductible , '' said Anthony Sabino , a law professor at St. John 's University . `` It 's a matter of taking an item and saying which side of the fence does it fall upon . '' Companies can , however , deduct punitive damages awarded in lawsuits from their taxes , an ability some U.S. lawmakers have been trying to change . Earlier this week , Senate Majority leader Harry Reid introduced a proposal to disallow such deductions in a pending tax bill . The timing of any tax deductions will depend on how the fund is structured , tax experts say . If BP keeps the funds on its books , but earmarked for the fund , no deduction can be taken until money is paid out , according to Johnson . If the fund is independent and there is no way of BP getting a refund for funds paid into it , they would be deductible . For David Heikkinen , an analyst with Tudor , Pickering , Holt , the question is whether or not the deductions will hold . `` Those expenses can be categorized as tax-deductible , '' he said . `` The question is , will the government allow them to be deducted ? `` Under today 's tax law , those are deductible costs . Everything seems like it can change , '' Heikkinen said .

Joe Barton of Texas , a major recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions , received such ridicule for his unusual apology to the oil giant that he later retracted his statement . At the start of a congressional hearing featuring testimony from Hayward , Barton said it was `` a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown , a $ 20 billion shakedown . '' `` I 'm speaking totally for myself , I 'm not speaking for the Republican Party ... but I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday , '' Barton told Hayward . Hours later , Barton retracted his statement , after Vice President Joe Biden condemned the comments as `` outrageous '' and the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives issued a joint statement denouncing them . `` I apologize for using the term ` shakedown ' with regard to yesterday 's actions at the White House in my opening statement this morning , and I retract my apology to BP , '' Barton said . He added : `` I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident . '' Barton 's statement had put his own Republicans on the defensive and gave hope to Democrats searching for any way to fend off expected losses to Republicans in November 2 congressional elections . At the White House , President Barack Obama shook his head in response and said , `` I do n't know why anyone would say that , '' said spokesman Robert Gibbs . Obama on Wednesday pressured BP to set up the compensation fund for the Gulf spill during a meeting at the White House . `` I find it incredibly insensitive , incredibly out of touch , '' Biden told reporters . `` There 's no shakedown . It 's insisting on responsible conduct and a responsible response to something they caused . '' Barton 's position was politically perilous because Americans largely blame BP for the devastating spill and want the huge company to pay for it . His stance was bound to be unpopular in the Gulf region , where the spill is wreaking havoc on the economy -- fishermen are out of work and hotel and restaurants are struggling in an area heavily dependent on tourism . Republican House leaders John Boehner , Eric Cantor and Mike Pence disassociated themselves from Barton . `` Congressman Barton 's statements this morning were wrong . BP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of $ 20 billion dollars for that purpose , '' they said . Even Hayward disagreed with Barton 's description of the escrow account as a `` slush fund . '' `` I certainly do n't think it was a slush fund , '' he told the hearing . The White House 's Gibbs said Republicans should ask themselves whether Barton should be their party 's leading representative on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce . There was some talk of Barton losing his position . But Barton was not alone among Republicans who question the $ 20 billion fund . Georgia Representative Tom Price , chairman of the Republican Study Committee , a group of conservative House members , issued a statement arguing the same point . Price said BP 's willingness to go along with the White House 's new fund suggests that the Obama administration is `` hard at work exerting its brand of Chicago-style shakedown politics . '' And former Texas Republican Representative Dick Armey , who was House majority leader and is a leading voice in the conservative Tea Party movement , told a Christian Science Monitor breakfast this week that Obama lacks the constitutional authority to set up such a fund . In addition , conservative Republican Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota told the Heritage Foundation think tank that the escrow account was a `` redistribution-of-wealth fund . '' Barton is the biggest recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions in the House of Representatives , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics . Its data showed that Barton has collected $ 1,447,880 from political action committees and individuals connected with the oil and gas industry since 1989 .

Obama announced the deal on the special fund after White House officials held four-hour talks with BP executives on the 58-day-old oil spill crisis . He said the money would go toward making the Gulf Coast `` whole again . '' Obama , who has been criticized by some for not being tough enough on BP , demanded in Wednesday 's White House meeting that the company set aside money in an independently administered fund to pay for claims arising from the worst oil spill in U.S. history . An April 20 explosion on an offshore rig owned by the British energy giant killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep-sea well . The ensuing spill has fouled 120 miles -LRB- 190 km -RRB- of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . In a conciliatory statement outside the White House , BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg apologized to the American people on behalf of BP . `` I do thank you for the patience that you have during this difficult time , '' he said . `` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies who do n't care , but that is not the case in BP , we care about the small people , '' Svanberg said . Svanberg said BP 's board had agreed not to pay dividends this year and promised to make sure damage claims were handled swiftly and fairly . BP said in a statement it would cut three quarters of dividends , significantly reduce its investment program and sell $ 10 billion of assets to fund a planned $ 20 billion fund to pay for the oil spill . The commitments are harsher penalties than most investors had expected . Investors had expected the suspension of BP 's dividend , or payment in shares for a couple of quarters and had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment -- moves that would curb BP 's future growth . The White House said it did not believe that BP would have agreed to set up the special fund without pressure . Obama had called for such a third-party administered fund after hearing first-hand complaints from Gulf coast residents that BP 's claims process was too long and complicated and that the company was paying out too little money . He stressed , however , that it did not put a cap on BP 's liabilities for the disaster . Obama said BP had also agreed to set aside $ 100 million for workers who had lost jobs because of a six-month moratorium his administration imposed on deepwater drilling after the spill . `` We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable . And I 'm absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people , '' Obama said . `` BP is a strong and viable company , and it is in all of our interests that it remain so , '' Obama said . The oil giant represents a large part of investments in Britain . Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron talked about the issues around the spill at the weekend . BP 's shares gyrated in volatile New York trading , dropping as much as 5 percent in the morning before swinging back to punch into positive territory after news of the agreement on the fund , known as an escrow account . `` It takes a little bit of pressure off BP , '' Iain Armstrong , an oil analyst at brokerage Brewin Dolphin in London , said of the escrow agreement . `` If it gets Obama off their back , it ca n't be that bad . '' The $ 20 billion figure is roughly equal to BP 's average annual profits over the past four years . Feinberg was the `` pay czar , '' the official who oversaw compensation for executives at companies that received federal bailout funds . Feinberg also oversaw a compensation fund for victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States . Underscoring concerns in Britain that Obama is trying to increase BP 's potential liabilities for the spill , Cameron said BP was eager to face claims arising from the spill but it should not have to pay any that are too far removed from the disaster . Cameron is under intense domestic pressure to stand up for BP , which many Britons perceive is being treated too harshly by the U.S. administration to the detriment of British pension funds and other investors with big stakes in BP . `` While it 's important that they -LRB- BP -RRB- pay reasonable claims , and BP accept this themselves , they do need a level of certainty , and this is BP 's worry , that there wo n't be claims entertained that are three or four times removed from the oil spill , '' Cameron said during a BBC radio phone-in program . As BP 's executives met with Obama administration officials at the White House , the company continued to wrestle with the oil spill in the Gulf . It started up a second system to siphon oil from its gushing leak early on Wednesday , a day after a team of U.S. scientists raised their high-end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from its well by 50 percent to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day . The new containment cap system is intended to increase overall collection capacity to 28,000 barrels a day from around 15,000 a day now . The company is drilling relief wells that it hopes will definitively halt the spill in August .

The outburst of sympathy follows an apology to Hayward from Texas Republican Representative Joe Barton on Thursday , later withdrawn , for having to agree to a deal with President Obama to set up a $ 20 billion fund for Gulf claim damages .

Investors are right to fear the long-term impact on the company . But they exaggerate the impact on the wider industry and the prospects for climate change legislation . BP however faces a very changed operating environment in future . Jun 11 , 2010 10:15 UTC - Kees Willemse is professor of off-shore engineering , Delft University . The opinions expressed are his own . - The news that a huge metal cap has been successfully placed over several of the leaking oil vents at the Deepwater Horizon site marks a potential turning point in the Gulf of Mexico crisis . It is already estimated that each day some 10-15 ,000 barrels of the oil that are spilling out into the ocean are being captured and diverted to ships on the sea surface . May 14 , 2010 09:52 UTC - Kees Willemse is professor of offshore engineering at Delft University . The opinions expressed are his own . - Last month s explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig continues to result in the leakage of an estimated 200,000 gallons -LRB- 910,000 litres -RRB- of oil into the Gulf of Mexico each day .

Anadarko Petroleum Corp , owner of a quarter of the well gushing into the Gulf , broke its near-silence on the spill to squarely pin blame -- and financial responsibility for claims -- on BP . `` Frankly , we are shocked , '' Houston-based Anadarko Chairman and CEO Jim Hackett said in a statement . `` BP 's behavior and actions likely represent gross negligence or willful misconduct , '' he added , driving his company 's shares up 2.2 percent in after-hours trading . BP , which has survived a tough week answering to Congress for the spill , said it `` strongly disagrees '' with the assessment of gross negligence . It is scrambling to line up resources to pay for a $ 20 billion damage claims fund demanded by President Barack Obama . Banking sources told Reuters the British energy giant was seeking $ 1 billion in loans from each of seven banks , and CNBC said it was hoping to raise $ 5 billion with a bond . The financial outlook is far from clear . Moments after Anadarko 's statement , credit rating agency Moody 's cut BP 's rating to junk level , citing potential liability from the spill , and earlier in the day it cut by three notches its rating on BP debt , which is trading around junk levels . As the crisis entered its 60th day , the U.S. Coast Guard admiral leading the U.S. government relief effort said BP had increased the amount of oil it was siphoning off from its blown-out deep-sea well to 25,000 barrels -LRB- 1.05 million gallons\\/3 .97 million liters -RRB- on Thursday . It was the largest pool of oil from the gusher yet collected by BP . On Wednesday , it siphoned off 18,600 barrels . But putting that figure in context , Admiral Thad Allen said 35,000 barrels a day , and possibly as much as 60,000 barrels , were gushing from the well , which ruptured after an April 20 explosion on an offshore oil rig which killed 11 workers . A device called a blowout preventer failed in the Gulf well , and the U.S. Interior Department on Friday changed rules for new wells , requiring drillers to submit plans for stopping blowouts and to gauge the chances of such a failure . The spill -- actually hundreds of thousands of small oil patches -- has idled much of the U.S. Gulf Coast 's multibillion dollar fishing industry and seeped into ecologically sensitive marches and wetlands despite the efforts of an army of workers to keep it at bay with oil-soaking booms . Gulf Coast residents worried this week that BP executives ' bruising encounters with Obama at the White House and lawmakers on Capitol Hill had diverted attention from the daily battle to clean up a spill that threatens their livelihoods . Individuals and businesses have claimed an estimated $ 600 million in damages from BP , but the company had paid only $ 71 million , less than 12 percent , by early this week , the U.S. House Judiciary Committee said on Friday . `` BP is stiffing too many victims and short-changing others , '' Democratic Representative John Conyers , the committee chairman , said in a statement . Kenneth Feinberg , the man picked by Obama to oversee the $ 20 billion compensation fund , pledged during a visit to the Gulf Coast state of Mississippi on Friday to pay legitimate claims quickly . A senior banker told Reuters BP 's outreach to banks , including Barclays , HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland , was part of an effort to raise capital for the claims fund . BP declined to comment . The company said on June 4 it had $ 5 billion in cash in addition to $ 5.25 billion in undrawn committed bank lines , and $ 5.25 billion in committed stand-by bank lines . BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg told Sky News Television on Friday that his company had `` strong underlying performance -- strong cash flow , strong operations . '' MORE MONEY MAY BE NEEDED Feinberg told CBS News on Friday $ 20 billion may not be enough to meet all legitimate claims . `` No one knows for sure yet , but the president made clear , and as I understand it BP went along , that if $ 20 billion is not enough , there will be additional funds provided , '' he said . After falling 6.8 percent in a week of volatility driven by politics in Washington , BP 's U.S.-listed shares hovered nearly unchanged on Friday . The shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . Investors appeared unimpressed by BP chief executive Tony Hayward 's performance at a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday . Lawmakers accused him of being evasive and of failing to take responsibility for the spill . `` Hayward 's performance was n't great , but it could have been worse . As a shareholder , our absolute top priority is to see that all energies are being diverted to cap this wretched well , '' said one top 10 investor . Investors and analysts said Hayward may cling on despite calls by some U.S. lawmakers for BP to `` clean house , '' but the future was less certain for Svanberg , who earlier in the week described those hurt by the oil spill as `` small people , '' for which he later apologized . Some shareholders say changing BP 's leadership now would be counterproductive when it is in the midst of a battle to cap its blown-out Macondo well . BP hopes a pair of relief wells now being drilled will halt the leak in August . The aim is for one or both relief wells to intersect with the leaking well at its bottom to pump in heavy drilling fluids and cement to seal it . The first relief well is within 200 feet of the side of the blown well , said Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production . But it must be drilled down farther before it can intersect with the blown well . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . I am tired of passing blame down to low level employees . It 's pressure from the top to squeeze out more profits that create the environment that makes middle and lower level managers make really bad decisions .

One such group Support BP calls itself the defender of an undeservedly harassed institution and seeks to show that the public opprobrium BP faces over its now 60-day-old Gulf of Mexico oil spill is not universal . Members have been increasingly vocal since a succession of strong rebukes of BP by U.S. President Obama and lawmakers at Thursday s congressional hearing , which they are calling a lynch mob . The outburst of sympathy follows an apology to Hayward from Texas Republican Representative Joe Barton on Thursday , later withdrawn , for having to agree to a deal with President Obama to set up a $ 20 billion fund for Gulf claim damages . Some of the Facebook posts echoed this same spirit of regret : My apologies as an American to Tony Hayward for the rude and insulting conduct as well as the rush to judgement by U.S. politicians on 16\\/7 , wrote George Gray , 50 , from Pennsylvania , referring to Thursday s hearing . The bulk of the group s posts are written by Americans . One woman offered financial support , brandishing a copy of her BP petrol receipt as proof of her solidarity with the oil major s plight . I buy BP petroleum products and I am proud to say that I do so . Did BP have an accident ? Are they working hard to correct the problem ? Yes , said Lara Olmos from Georgia . Others urged readers to look beyond dead fish to the potential damage of the Obama hysterics on the future of BP and transatlantic relations . Our concern is Obama s folly and injustice , said the site master and received 42 votes of approval from group members . Members also cheered a brief BP share price rally on Thursday . Pity for the beleaguered oil major is still a marginal sentiment . On Friday the Support BP site had 1,039 fans while the Boycott BP site had 652,128 . But it shows that for some , victim-status has shifted from drowning birds and idle fishermen to the hunched , penitent figure of Tony Hayward in the dock even as the oil continues to spew from the BP rig .

REUTERS\\/Larry Downing Interesting that Mr Gray uses European date notation in his comment defending BP . HaHaHa I 've seen a lot of people supporting the BP `` accident '' , do what you got to do . As for me , I 'm against it . Why should we fund BP 20 BILLION dollars to fix this mistake ? BP should have made sure everything was in proper working condition before they started this project . Another thing that irritates me , is the fact that the oil leak has been going on for 60 days now , and BP suddenly has a solution that will only take 2 weeks to resolve this issue . Why did they let it go on for so long ? As for our `` president '' , he can find time to golf and admire his `` luxuries '' , but it takes him 57 days to make an appointment with the chief executive ? What 's wrong with this picture ? We as AMERICANS need to wake up and look around at everything going on and start voicing our opinions , instead of backing down , or taking up for them because you think it 's the right thing to do . Is it ok to agree with the 20 BILLION dollar fund and put us even furthur in debt and raise our taxes even higher ??? I do n't think so . I am just staggered by the hypocracy and ignorance displayed by the US senators over the BP disaster . Were they all as vocal in 1984 over the Bhopal disaster , caused as I understand it by gross negligence by Union Carbide , A UNITED STATES COMPANY ! When will Mr Obhama be demanding $ 20 Billion from Union Carbide ? Thomas Jefferson Stated if a man has no god or twenty and neither picks my pocket or causes me injury why should I care . Has BP , the company Mr. Hayward directs , done either to the U.S. ? If so , then who are the likely candidates to hold responsible ?

Sixty-one days after the BP Plc well began spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico , angry local officials blame dozens of federal agencies involved in approving response plans , a maze of regulations and poor coordination for their struggles beating back the slick . `` My experience has been frustration , too much red tape , no a sense of urgency . For the state and the coastal parishes that are directly affected to put forth a plan , you have to kick and scream every step of the way to get it approved , '' said John Young , council chairman for Jefferson Parish in Louisiana . `` The president said it 's a war . I agree we 're under siege , but if it was a war , we 'd be occupied territory now . '' It is time for President Barack Obama 's administration to appoint an `` oil spill czar '' to streamline operations for the 31,000 people fighting the worst spill in U.S. history and avoid the costly delays , Young said as he prepared to board a boat to tour his region 's fouled wetlands . As a guide , many point to the arrival of U.S. Army General Russel Honore in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . The tough-talking military man was credited with taking control and kick-starting the city 's stalled rescue mission in the weeks after the storm . Last week , the U.S. Coast Guard shut down 16 vacuum barges that were sucking up crude from Louisiana marshes . The units , which consist of trucks and tanks on barges that suck up thousands of gallons of crude , needed to be checked for stability and if they had life jackets and fire extinguishers . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal had asked officials to inspect them quickly without bringing them back to dock . But the units sat idle for 24 hours before being allowed to travel back to oil-fouled Barataria Bay , Bay Jimmy and Pass A Loutre . After 24 hours , the barges went back to work , and according to media reports , no inspections were performed . On Friday , the Coast Guard shut down two more barges , prompting Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser to make an angry call the White House , which ordered them back into operation , his office said . Meanwhile , the oil keeps gushing into the Gulf at a rate now estimated as high as 60,000 barrels a day . Jindal has blasted a lack of coordination between federal departments overseeing the fight and state and local officials waging it . `` It is frustrating because it does n't seem like the left hand knows what the right hand is doing , '' he said recently . `` There is no streamlined system here . This is why we keep stressing that we need to see more of a sense of urgency from the Coast Guard , federal officials and BP . '' For its part , the Coast Guard said it supported the barge project , but had to ensure their safety . The incidents followed a weeks-long effort by state and local officials to have a plan approved to construct sand berms to protect barrier islands from encroaching oil , an effort that is expected to cost $ 360 million . Young said he supported a military-style chain of command where someone at the top has the power the make quick decisions putting response plans into action and making sure that crews have the equipment they need . `` Absolutely -- one person . Maybe they need an escrow account for that . Get one military person who knows the chain of command to get things done , because this is a war-type situation , '' Young said . `` We ca n't be deciding and executing by committee because it 's just not getting done .

What came of this meeting ? Please provide any records or documents that came out of this meeting . 3 -RRB- Does the Administration have any new approaches , independent of BP , Halliburton or Transoceanic , to resolve this disaster ? Are there any ongoing or planned discussions between Administration officials and other private sector people not directly involved with the Deepwater Horizon rig ? 4 -RRB- Has EPA proposed any new and innovative technological solutions to assist with the oil spill clean-up ? 5 -RRB- Thus far , the solutions implemented to stop the gushing oil seem to be real-time ideas generated as the previous ones fail . Many of these are no different from the tactics used in 1979 when the Ixtoc I well blew up off the coast of Mexico . How will the Administration improve upon the regulatory system in order to minimize the chances of a repeat of what we currently face ? 6 -RRB- To what extent has the Administration weighed in on the various tactics to stop the oil leak ? Are the methods implemented so far the best possible ones ? Are there other tactics BP could have used earlier that may have contained the spill , but perhaps at high economic cost to BP ? 7 -RRB- How many times have government safety inspectors visited Deepwater Horizon during your tenure as President ? Please provide all inspection documents and records of Deepwater Horizon since January 2009 , including all contingency safety plans . 8 -RRB- Under what circumstances did Elizabeth Birnbaum leave her post as head of the Minerals Management Service ? Did she resign or was she forced to step down ? 9 -RRB- You have made comments about the cozy relationship between regulators and oil companies , and vowed to reform MMS . Was Elizabeth Birnbaum part of that problem ? How do you propose to reform MMS ? 10 -RRB- What is your long-term environmental plan to protect and rejuvenate the affected coastline ? 11 -RRB- What is your long-term plan to protect the jobs of those affected by this disaster and to reinvigorate the economy of their hometowns ? I would appreciate a response to these questions by Friday July 2 , 2010 .

BP also restarted its effort to siphon oil spewing from the well in the Gulf of Mexico after the system was shut down for 10 hours to fix a problem with its fire-prevention equipment and to let a storm pass . To try to minimize the leak 's impact , the British energy giant is containing some of the oil as it gushes from well on the sea floor . The system has been `` building up to stable rates since '' it was restarted , BP said in a statement . A second siphoning system is also running . Word of the latest problem in controlling the leak -- which has caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- came after Anadarko Petroleum Corp , part owner of the well , accused BP of `` reckless '' conduct leading up to the accident . Sixty-one days after a BP offshore oil rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico , the encroaching oil spill is threatening the coastal economies of four U.S. states including Louisiana , whose fragile wetlands have been hardest hit . In Florida , the Bay County Emergency Operations Center confirmed that tar balls washed onto the beach Panama City , a popular tourist destination , and crews were cleaning them up . `` I was out on the water the other day and it was just horrible . It was all over the place . They 've got about a 40 mile slick and about a mile wide just a couple of miles off shore , '' said Danny Proctor , of Destin , Florida , another seaside resort . BP said its systems captured 24,500 barrels of oil out of a capacity of 28,000 barrels a day before the shutdown and it hoped to restart the system after a lightning storm passes . Anadarko , the owner of a quarter of the ruptured well , has pinned the blame -- and the financial responsibility -- squarely on BP . `` There appears to be gross negligence or willful misconduct , '' Houston-based Anadarko Chairman and CEO Jim Hackett said in an interview that helped to drive his company 's shares up 2.2 percent in after-hours trading on the hopes it could avoid multibillion-dollar liabilities . BP said it `` strongly disagrees '' with the accusation of gross negligence but would keep focusing on the oil spill and is working with federal , state and local authorities to try to protect the coastline . So far , Louisiana 's wetlands and its fishing industry have been hardest hit by the spill , but Mississippi , Alabama and parts of Florida 's coast have also been affected . Leroy Jones , a sixth-generation oysterman in the south Louisiana fishing port of Buras , said he worries his way of life could be lost as marshes that feed the oyster beds are contaminated . `` It 's wild ... It feels like 100 pounds of stress is added every day , '' he said as he painted his boat instead of fishing . On the job , he makes as much as $ 1,700 a day from oysters . Compensation checks from BP are a fraction of that . The new federal administrator of a fund to pay for damages , Kenneth Feinberg , said it would be a `` horror '' if BP went bankrupt , but the $ 20 billion fund agreed to by BP under pressure from the White House could be increased if it proves insufficient . President Barack Obama has seen his popularity slip over his handling of the spill and lawmakers in Washington used congressional hearings with BP to gather ammunition ahead of November elections . BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward was conspicuously absent from a gathering of global oil industry leaders on Saturday in St Petersburg , Russia , where his company 's woes were a constant topic of discussion . Residents and local officials see costs skyrocketing with the crippling of the multibillion dollar Gulf fishing industry , a deep water oil drilling moratorium and growing environmental destruction along the coast . `` I think it 's going to go over $ 100 billion , '' said Brian Miguez , a food service salesman from New Orleans , at his vacation property in Grand Isle , Louisiana , where the spill has forced the closure and cleanup of six miles of sandy beach . `` They have n't even felt the wrath of the lawsuits that are going to come in , '' he said . BP is seeking up to $ 7 billion in loans from seven banks , banking sources told Reuters . The sources said BP may offer up to $ 10 billion in debt as early as next week . Its debt is now trading at junk levels , and Moody 's has cut its rating three notches on concerns about spill liabilities . Moments after Anadarko said BP would have to pay all claims , After falling 6.8 percent in a volatile week driven by Washington politics , BP 's shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . The first of a pair of relief wells meant to stop the oil flow in August is within 200 feet of the side of the blown well , said Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production . But it must be drilled farther before it can intersect with the blown well . BP is capturing record amounts of crude but Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said 35,000 barrels a day , and possibly as much as 60,000 barrels , are pouring from the well , which exploded on April 20 killing 11 workers . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Major funders of Bush 's oil deregulation frenzy . Not innocent , not by a long shot . This reminds me of the tobacco industry shakedown in which the government sued the tobacco industry for billions in damages on behalf of smokers . Smokers and ex-smokers never got a dime of that money . I hope the gulf coast fishermen fare better than smokers did but I think the money will probably just be funneled to the states and it will then disappear and the fishermen will be left holding empty nets . This `` spill '' is enormous and the lawyer-up of the BP executives may actually be as big a crisis . For us `` small people '' who have to rely upon the oil companies to supply us with the oils and gas we regretfully need it is right for us to expect from them a fair shake and from the government a proper oversight of the technical issues surrounding the drilling and manufacturing of the oil products . There has been a breakdown totally across the industrial-government divide , a corrupted state where the money talked and the narrow minded self serving twits who were in positions of authority put all risk aside for their personal gain . To say `` golden parachute '' is a vast understatement because millions will be paid in lawyer fees to keep them out of jail . It is a tragedy for all involved . So the escrow fund is a good thing , but I would go further and extend this `` idea '' to all of the oil companies doing business in the USA . My point -- when is the last time you filled up at a gas station and actually tried to use a restroom if one was available -- think about that . Some are quite clean and functional most terrible and many not existent or allowed as seen in Maryland too much . Now when was the last time you were at a National Park and used the restroom . Amazing is n't it that in that domain the restroom facilities are examples -- well lets make them just that and throw that into the `` JOBS '' category that spills out of the oil spill rebuild issue . Oil companies and their affiliates run around 1200 to 1500 gas stations each in the USA and most could use significant upgrades in public restrooms , the actual grounds , access paths , and walk ways around the station and the curbs , parking area and entrances to the station complex itself . I contend that an additional $ 250,000 a year to each of these stations would only eat up a few billion of oil company resources and could be written off tax wise . Meanwhile , taking the New Jersey example people -- untrained people -- would be hired an trained to serve the pumps -LRB- not full service by required service -RRB- and a permanent maintenance and cleanup crew that would place every station in the class of restroom quality as the National park system -- approximately a team of 12 people working in shifts . Thinks about it -- a real plus to all of us , jobs and work for local construction companies ... and we get a clean environment as we pay for our oil products . This discussion is now closed .

Sheila Williams , a spokeswoman for the British energy giant , said Hayward was spending time with his teenage son at the Isle of Wight boat race after devoting most of the past two months to the oil spill away from his family . Hayward was lambasted by angry U.S. lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Thursday , where he was accused of ducking responsibility for the spill . The Obama administration , which has been harshly critical of Hayward over some of his public statements since the spill began in April , renewed its criticism of the CEO over his attendance at the race . `` This has just been part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes , '' White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said in an interview taped for ABC 's `` This Week '' week program , referring to Hayward . President Barack Obama , who has been criticized for his administration 's response to the spill , himself attended a baseball game in Washington on Friday night and played golf on Saturday . Obama wondered aloud in a television interview this month about `` whose ass to kick '' over the BP spill and said that if Hayward had worked for him , he would have fired him . Hayward was also widely criticized and quickly apologized for complaining he wanted his `` life back '' weeks after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon offshore rig explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history . `` Well , to quote Tony Hayward , he 's got his life back , as he would say , '' Emanuel said , commenting on his attendance at the yacht race . `` And I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting . '' `` There 's really a substance here that matters , '' Emanuel added . `` That 's clearly a PR mistake , but he 's made a number of those mistakes . What 's important is : are we capping the well ? Are we capturing the oil ? Are we containing the cleanup ? Are we filing the claims ? Are we also cleaning up the mess ? That 's what 's important . '' Opinion about Hayward 's attendance at the race was mixed among residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast , hard hit by the spill . `` You 've got to think about all the fish that are dying out there , all the birds that are dying ... and that 's going to never come back , '' said Venice , Louisiana resident , Wilma Buras . `` So Hayward going out was n't the best way ... absolutely not . '' Jim Bowman , a recreational fisherman in Venice , said there was a lot of work to be done cleaning up the spill , but `` family is the most important thing , so he 's got to spend time with his family .

It definitely means no dividend for the next few years I have for weeks tried to urge people in government and the media to hire our own super-tankers and surround the well at a safe distance and pump surface oil onboard to be processed at facilities onshore . We must have tanker capacity to keep up with the flow rate until the well is secured . New Orleans is a deep water port . The oil spill is not BP 's problem . It is however clearly their fault . The problem is now ours to deal with . The ex-president of Shell Oil suggested this weeks ago on CNN but was apparently ignored . The Saudis used super tankers and retrieved 80 % of their oil spill . They were also smart enough to know that the use of dispersants would render the oil unretrievable . The myriad of US agencies involved in this spill are not proceeding in a unified direction ... ... . they are just posturing while dolphins wash up on shore . The Coast Guard can coordinate the super tanker operations instead of counting life jackets on barges employed to block oil from the sensitive Louisiana marshes .

Its estimate of up to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil per day is far higher than the current U.S. government estimate of up to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- gushing daily from the ruptured offshore well into the sea . BP spokesman Toby Odone said the document appeared to be genuine but the estimate applied only to a situation in which a key piece of equipment called a blowout preventer is removed . `` Since there are no plans to remove the blowout preventer , the number is irrelevant , '' he said . The British energy giant , still struggling to stop a leak that began on April 20 and is causing an economic and environmental disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast , is planning to raise $ 50 billion to cover the cost of the largest oil spill in U.S. history , London 's Sunday Times reported . The oil spill is now in its 62nd day and has dealt a blow to fishing and tourism industries across four Gulf states , soiling coastlines that are a playground for tourists and vital habitat for wildlife . The amount of oil spurting from the well has been a matter of considerable controversy in the past two months , with critics saying BP consistently understated the flow rate . The internal BP document , which is undated , was released by U.S. Representative Ed Markey , chairman of a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . The document appears to estimate the highest potential flow of oil if key components of the well fail . It does not indicate that the 100,000 barrels per day is BP 's estimate of the actual amount gushing from the ruptured Gulf of Mexico well . `` Right from the beginning , BP was either lying or grossly incompetent , '' Markey told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' `` First they said it was only 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels . '' But BP 's Odone said , `` I do n't think there 's been any underestimating . We 've always said we would deal with whatever volume of oil was being spilled and that 's exactly what we 're doing . '' The document was posted on the Internet here London 's Sunday Times , without citing any sources , said BP planned to raise $ 10 billion from a bond sale , $ 20 billion from banks and $ 20 billion from asset sales over the next two years to cover the cost of the spill . BP said last week it would suspend dividend payments to its shareholders and increase the pace of asset sales to $ 10 billion this year to offset liabilities from the spill , which began after an explosion on an offshore rig that killed 11 workers . The Financial Times reported BP is considering doubling the $ 10 billion asset sale program as part of a push to strengthen the company 's liquidity as it comes under financial pressure . BP said 21,040 barrels of oil -LRB- 883,680 gallons\\/3 .34 million liters -RRB- -RRB- leaking from the well was collected by its siphoning systems Saturday . A large amount of oil continues to leak into the sea from the ruptured well a mile below the ocean surface despite the BP containment systems . Kenneth Feinberg , the independent administrator appointed to run the $ 20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate victims for financial losses due to the oil spill , said he would make sure that `` every eligible , legitimate claim is paid and paid quickly . '' Appearing on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Feinberg rejected the complaint of a senior Republican congressman , Joe Barton , who said last week that the fund set up by BP under pressure from President Barack Obama amounted to a government `` shakedown . '' `` I do n't think it helps to politicize this program , '' said Feinberg , an arbitration lawyer who dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . `` This a voluntary program . No one is compelled to come into this fund . '' Despite assurances of swift compensation , Louisiana Gulf residents remained skeptical . `` Every time they say there 's a fund for fisherman , we wait years and years , '' said Tal Plork , whose fisherman husband , Phan , faced long waits for aid after two hurricanes rampaged across the Gulf region in 2008 . `` It was like that for Gustav and Ike . Hopefully now they will go faster . '' Plork , 42 , has had to go to work since the oil leak began because her husband 's fishing income has dried up . She works at a cafeteria at the BP camp in Venice , Louisiana , and has been supporting her five children mainly on credit cards . Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour , also appearing on `` Meet the Press , '' said he was anxious to see the well capped , the spill cleaned up and BP cover the entire cost . `` Nothing is satisfactory until the well is shut in . When the well is capped , then clean up the oil , and then BP pays the bills . Until all of that is done , nothing is satisfactory , '' said Barbour , a Republican . Barbour said he thought the U.S. federal government `` has done more right than wrong '' in its handling of the disaster . After falling 6.8 percent last week , BP 's shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . Despite the battering to its reputation and stock stemming from the disaster , hedge fund T2 Partners said it likes shares in the British oil firm , according to a Barron 's article published Sunday . In a column titled `` Other Voices , '' T2 's managing partners said their reasons for recently taking a new position in BP are that it is `` extraordinarily cheap , '' and that the firm is `` highly likely '' to be able to cover clean-up , damages , fines and lawsuits relating to the disaster . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Nobody thought it was insensitive of Obama to vacation in an $ 8m house after his inauguration , when so many people lived in their car because of the great recession . I 'm sure , the people in Iraq and Afghanistan would also like to get their life back after the US invasions for no more real purpose than : oil . 20 Billion $ for the oil clean up ? It 's for the U.S. Government to embezzle . Very little of that money will make it to the Gulf victims . Do you know who is going to pay for the oil clean up ? Yep , We will probably pay a couple of bucks per a gallon more at the pump in a year or two .

NEW ORLEANS\\/LAFITTE , Louisiana | Mon Jun 21 , 2010 7:51 pm EDT NEW ORLEANS\\/LAFITTE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil services companies went to court on Monday seeking to overturn President Barack Obama 's six-month ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the worst oil spill in U.S. history . U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman said he would decide by Wednesday whether to temporarily lift the ban while the case is heard . More than a dozen companies involved in offshore drilling operations filed the lawsuit , calling the ban `` arbitrary and capricious . '' `` The government 's unchecked authority has shut down this entire industry , '' argued lawyer Carl Rosenblum , representing the oil industry . The lawsuit is the first seeking to reverse Obama 's May 28 moratorium , which the companies say will force job cuts in the labor force needed to service offshore oil platforms . The ban has caused the shutdown of 33 deepwater drilling rigs . Obama imposed the ban after an explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 killed 11 workers and ruptured a well owned by BP Plc , unleashing millions of gallons of crude into the ocean . The Obama administration argues that the moratorium is necessary to prevent further accidents while a presidential commission investigates the cause of the BP spill . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , a Republican critic of the Obama administration 's handling of the spill , has sided with the companies in the case . The lawsuit is another example of the administration 's strained relations with big business , which was on display last week when BP bowed to pressure from Obama and agreed to set up a $ 20 billion oil spill damages fund . The spill , now in its 63rd day , has soiled the coastline of four U.S. states , threatening tourism and fishing industries ; seeped into ecologically sensitive wetlands and marshes ; battered BP 's image ; and tested Obama , who has come under fire over his handling of the crisis . If spill spreads , BP could face challenges beyond the Gulf Coast . Attorneys general from 11 states on the U.S. East Coast warned they would hold the company responsible for injury to wildlife that could affect their coastline . An independent federal agency that investigates chemical accidents -- the U.S. Chemical Safety Board -- is launching a probe into the root causes of the spill . The case will be handled by the investigators who examined BP 's safety practices after a deadly 2005 refinery explosion in Texas . BP said it has spent $ 2 billion so far on clean-up . Fueling investor concern about BP 's final bill for the spill , a Democratic U.S. lawmaker on Sunday released an internal company document that said , in a worst-case scenario , up to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil a day could gush from its ruptured deep-sea well . The British energy company dismissed it , saying the figure was being taken out of context . But investors , apparently worried it could mean higher fines and clean-up costs for BP , drove its shares down 4.5 percent in New York trading . BP plans to raise cash from banks to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay for the clean-up but does not plan a bond offering , sources familiar with the company 's thinking told Reuters on Monday . Banking sources said last week that BP was seeking some $ 7 billion from banks . BP has considered several ways to raise more money , such as selling assets . But for now , it is confident its cash resources can cover the bulk of the clean-up costs , one source said . Seeking to keep the focus on the ecological disaster , New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu hosted mayors from 17 U.S. cities on a visit to the Mississippi Delta , where oil has coated fragile marshlands , tarred wildlife and decimated fisheries . During the mayors ' visit to marshes in Louisiana 's Barataria Bay , the stench of coagulating oil hung in the air as miles of boom encircled oil-stained marshes and scores of boats skimmed oil from the bay 's waters . BP continued to siphon more oil from the blown-out deep-sea well . It said it collected or burned off 23,290 barrels -LRB- 978,180 gallons\\/3 .7 million liters -RRB- of crude on Sunday , still well below the 35,000-60 ,000 barrels a day that government scientists estimate are gushing from the well . Both BP and the U.S. government are placing their hopes on two relief wells that are being drilled to permanently cap the leak . Those wells are expected to be finished in August . BP Managing Director Bob Dudley is in day-to-day charge of the company 's response to the spill after Chief Executive Tony Hayward returned to Britain last week , the company said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Executives only understand costs , not human suffering . Hit them with severe penalties , and if someone in Congress objects , publicize it loudly . should consider a fact that is being ignored : Louisianans - because of its royalty payments from oil and gas has the lowest property taxes in the U.S. for fourty plus years . Since they did not share that income with other states and the citizens of Texas and Louisiana certainly supported their oil industry benefactors as evidenced by the Joe Barton 's ; I '' shed my tears for the fish !! Just wait until the oil is caught by the Loop current and transported around FL and up the East Coast at 1 m\\/sec . The cost of damages will triple . This discussion is now closed .

The White House said it would immediately appeal the judge 's ruling , issued in New Orleans . Oil companies involved in offshore drilling operations had challenged the government 's six-month moratorium . A new Reuters\\/Ipsos poll found that most Americans still support offshore drilling , despite watching a huge slick from BP Plc 's Gulf of Mexico oil spill devastate fragile wetlands and communities along the U.S. Gulf coast . The possible scale of the ecological catastrophe was underscored when U.S. scientists said as much as one million times the normal level of methane gas has been found in some regions near the spill , enough to deplete oxygen and create a dead zone . If such dead zones were linked to the spill they could ultimately add to BP 's mounting costs . The 64-day-old disaster has shattered investor confidence in BP , which has seen its stock price slashed in half since the start of the crisis . The British energy giant 's London share price tumbled to its lowest level in 13 years on Tuesday . After the BP well ruptured on April 20 , spewing millions of gallons of crude , President Barack Obama imposed the ban on deep-sea drilling while officials checked that other wells were operating safely . In granting a request by more than a dozen oil services companies for the ban to be overturned , Judge Martin Feldman challenged its `` immense scope . '' The Interior Department , which oversees offshore drilling , said despite the ruling , the firms still had to meet new safety and environmental rules before they could resume operations . Expanding offshore drilling was among Obama 's proposals to revamp U.S. energy policy . He hoped it would generate support from Republicans for more controversial aspects of his plans to fight climate change . But he shelved that plan after the spill and White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama believed that `` continuing to drill at these depths without knowing what happened does not make any sense . '' The administration will probably ask for a stay of the court ruling as it pursues its appeal . The court 's decision was a victory for offshore energy producers like BP , Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell . They have been hamstrung by the ban , and are eyeing relocating their giant rigs to other basins like Brazil . Shares in oil drilling companies briefly spiked after the ruling but dipped again when the Obama administration said it would appeal . The S&P energy sector fell 1.3 percent . BP 's London-listed shares hit their lowest level since February 1997 on Tuesday , dropping more than 5 percent before coming off lows . U.S.-listed shares closed down 2.14 percent at $ 29.68 . They have not traded around these levels since 1996 . In London , BP 's shares have fallen 32 percent in June alone and are on track to suffer their worst month since at least 1965 , according to Thomson Reuters Datastream . The court ruling infuriated U.S. environmental groups . The Sierra Club said it would join the Obama administration in appealing it and called the ruling `` a slap in the face to the communities that have been hit hard by this tragedy . '' The spill has dealt a severe blow to the U.S. Gulf Coast 's tourism and fishing industries and soiled large parts of a 400-mile coastline from Louisiana to Florida . But the ruling was welcomed by Gulf Coast residents whose livelihoods depend on the oil industry . `` It takes away the uncertainty . It 's going to get some people back to work immediately , '' said Tony Frickey , site supervisor at the Venice Port Complex in Venice , Louisiana . BP said it had captured 25,830 barrels -LRB- 1,084,860 gallons\\/4 ,106,641 liters -RRB- of oil from the ruptured well on Monday , the highest amount yet . Between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day are gushing from the well , according to U.S. government estimates . Despite the spill , 56 percent of Americans believe offshore drilling is necessary for the United States to produce its own energy and not rely on other countries , while 38 percent believe it is a bad idea , according to the Reuters poll . The poll also found about three-quarters of Americans believe neither BP nor the government responded quickly enough to the disaster . The Obama administration has walked a tightrope in responding to public outrage over the spill and defending its own handling of the crisis against criticism that the relief effort has been too slow and ineffective . Much of this criticism has come from local governments on the spill front line . Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish in southern Louisiana , said the Interior Department had ordered a halt to dredging operations aimed at creating a sand berm as a barrier to the spreading crude . `` We are being required to move our dredging site two more miles farther off our barrier coast , causing us to lose precious time in our fight , '' he said in a letter to Obama .

Asked when the legislation might start moving through the House , Waxman responded , `` I do n't have a timetable . '' The April 20 explosion on a BP-leased oil rig that led to the worst environmental accident in U.S. history triggered a wave of congressional investigations . Following several high-profile hearings , including testimony from top BP officials , bills to address the problem are beginning to move and others are being drafted . It 's too early to know how their final versions will look or when Congress might complete the work . Waxman 's committee alone has held seven hearings on the oil spill since May 12 . One House Democratic aide said that members of the Energy and Commerce Committee `` have heard enough information to at least get started in terms of the regulatory and legislative responses '' to the disaster . Last month , President Barack Obama created an independent commission to probe the oil spill . But with that panel only now getting organized , Democrats in Congress are not waiting for it to wrap up its work sometime next year , when Republicans likely will hold more seats in the Senate and House . `` We want to make sure that where there 's a government permit to allow drilling , that all necessary safety measures are reviewed and approved and that the standards are met , '' Waxman said . A House Democratic leadership aide added , `` It 's my understanding '' that Waxman is writing legislation addressing the `` design , maintenance and testing of drilling equipment . '' The committee also might hold new hearings , according to House aides , but those sessions have not yet been firmed up . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had set a July 4 deadline for lawmakers to put together ideas on how to deal legislatively with the BP oil spill , which is estimated to be releasing as much as 60,000 barrels of oil a day into Gulf waters . A series of bills could be debated in the House in coming weeks . On Wednesday , the House was poised to pass a bill granting subpoena power to the Obama-appointed commission . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also is having his committee chairmen write legislation that could be folded into a larger energy and environment bill he hopes to put to a vote in July or early August . That bill likely would encourage the use of more alternative fuels by electric utilities in addition to stepping up regulation of drilling . It also might impose mandatory carbon dioxide emission reductions to fight global warming , but Democrats are split on this . Other oil spill-related bills moving in the House include : -- The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday approved a bill to expand the type of damages that can be claimed in oil spills . Other bills pending in Congress would raise or lift caps on industry liability . The Judiciary committee also voted to authorize issuing subpoenas to BP for documents on its Gulf oil spill claims process ; -- House Democrats will try to pass emergency spending legislation soon that includes around $ 200 million for oil spill-related activities . The bill also would allow the Interior Department to take more time to review lease requests for oil drilling ; -- House committees are working on bills to improve worker safety in oil spill cleanup efforts and to develop better preparedness standards for offshore energy projects .

Obama 's rating stood at 45 percent in the Wall Street Journal\\/NBC News poll , down 5 points from early last month . For the first time in the survey , more people -- 48 percent -- say they disapprove of Obama 's job performance . A majority of respondents , 62 percent , said the country was on the wrong track . Forty-nine percent of those surveyed rate Obama positively on `` strong leadership qualities , '' down from 70 percent when he became president and a drop of 8 points since January . The poll also showed growing concern over the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and slipping confidence in Obama 's handling of the environmental disaster that has shut down rich fishing grounds and soiled the coastlines of four U.S. states . In the two months since the spill started , Obama has made four visits to the Gulf and pressured BP to agree to a $ 20 billion account to help pay for relief . Half the poll respondents said they disapprove of Obama 's handling of the spill , including one in four Democrats . Forty percent of respondents rate him positively on his `` ability to handle a crisis , '' was down 11 points since January . The oil spill has slightly changed Americans ' attitudes about offshore drilling , the poll found . In May , 60 percent of respondents said they favor more offshore drilling off the U.S. coast . In this poll , support slipped to 53 percent and nearly two-thirds of respondents said they wanted more regulation of oil companies . The poll of 1,000 people was conducted June 17-21 and has a margin for error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points . -LRB- Reporting by JoAnne Allen ; Editing by Chris Wilson -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

After striking down the moratorium on Tuesday , a federal judge in New Orleans rejected a request to allow the six-month ban to stand while the government appeals his decision . Judge Martin Feldman issued a brief order denying the stay request , pointing to his previous ruling that criticized the ban as arbitrary , far-reaching and unjustified given the impact on thousands of oil industry workers and communities . The government has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and can ask it to stay Feldman 's decision . It is also revising the ban to make it more flexible and possibly open some areas to drilling , but has not said when it will issue a new moratorium . Feldman 's latest ruling was more unwelcome news for the administration , which has been on the defensive over what critics call a slow and ineffective response to the 66-day-old spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The government imposed the moratorium after a well owned by BP Plc ruptured on April 20 , unleashing millions of gallons of crude into the sea , one of the biggest environmental catastrophes to hit the United States . But the ban , set by President Barack Obama while a commission investigates the causes of the disaster , has been condemned by some on the Gulf Coast , where the economy is closely tied to the energy industry . `` I think he 's lost his mind . If they shut down the oil fields , I might as well shut down , '' said Joan Strohmeyer , who owns a hotel in Venice , Louisiana . The spill has shut down rich fishing grounds , threatened the Gulf Coast 's tourism industry , tarred beaches and killed hundreds of turtles and birds and dozens of dolphins . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told lawmakers in Washington the government was aware of the moratorium 's impact on the Gulf Coast economy , but he said the ban was necessary `` until we get to a level where we can provide a sense of safety to the American people that drilling can in fact continue . '' Oil companies say the government has not proven the need for a blanket ban on deep sea drilling and warn it will lead to major layoffs . Judge Feldman agreed and in his ruling on Tuesday sharply rebuked the U.S. government . BP SHARES HIT NEW LOW The spill has undermined investor confidence in BP , a staple of British pension funds , as estimated clean-up costs soar . The British energy giant has seen its shares lose almost half their value since the spill . BP 's U.S.-listed shares closed down 3.13 percent at $ 28.74 in New York trading on Thursday , hitting a new year-low . The company 's stock lost 2.47 percent in London . Analysts said investors were reacting to news that the U.S. government was reviewing the environmental impact of BP plans to drill in Alaska . `` Think about it . How many holes can you have in a bucket ? There are just too many problems , '' said Joe Saluzzi , co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham , New Jersey . Shareholders are also worried about how much BP will ultimately have to pay for cleaning up the mess in the Gulf of Mexico . Under U.S. political pressure , it agreed last week to set up a $ 20 billion fund to pay damages to oil spill victims . BP also faces more than 240 spill-related lawsuits , most filed on behalf of businesses , including commercial fishermen , shippers and resort operators , according to the Westlaw database . Westlaw is a unit of Thomson Reuters . But at its current levels BP 's share price is attracting some interest -- fund managers who focus on undervalued and unloved stocks have started buying BP shares . The purchases seem small so far and some portfolio managers are still analyzing whether the company will come out of the disaster intact , managers speaking at the Morningstar annual investing conference in Chicago said on Thursday . BP said its oil-capture systems at the leak collected or burned off 16,830 barrels of oil on Wednesday , a 38 percent drop from Tuesday 's record rate of 27,100 , after an underwater accident forced a 10-hour shutdown . With the hurricane season having officially started on June 1 , BP is keeping an eye on stormy weather , which could hamper its clean-up and containment efforts . The U.S. National Hurricane Center said a tropical wave over the western Caribbean Sea could develop into a tropical depression over the next couple of days as it moves toward the Gulf of Mexico . Most weather models forecast it would move toward the southern Texas and Mexico coasts . Earlier , some models had projected the wave would move toward the BP clean-up operation in the central U.S. Gulf Coast . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . There is way too much pressure to cap it with mud or cement . Come on BP don t make a bad situation worse . Use a one million lb malleable lead tapered cap . You will have to cut loose the Blowout Preventer first using a CLEAN CUT . Stop the insane dispersants . It is worse than cleaning the oil on the surface , way worse . If BP wants to collect the oil , perhaps they should consider using a capture pipe to the surface the same size or larger then the pipe installed at the Blow-Out Preventer instead of the `` Garden Hose '' They are using now .

L -RRB- -LRB- BP . N -RRB- , British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Friday some certainty is needed over its costs from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill even as the company 's stock plunged to a 14-year low . Total share losses for the embattled British energy giant since the worst oil spill in U.S. history began on April 20 stand at around $ 100 billion , more than halving its market value prior to the disaster . BP stock on Friday fell more than 6 percent in London and New York . BP plans to nearly double next week its capacity for siphoning oil gushing from its ruptured deep-sea well , but a looming storm is raising fears the effort could be disrupted for days or weeks . BP and the U.S. government nervously watched as an approaching low-pressure system over the western Caribbean Sea gathered strength . Cameron is due to meet on Saturday with U.S. President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the G8\\/G20 summits in Canada . He has pledged to discuss BP with Obama , who has been highly critical of the company . British business and shareholder groups have clamored for Cameron to defend the company . `` I think it is also in all our long-term interests that there is some clarity , some finality , to all of this , so that we do n't at the same time see the destruction of a company that is important for all our interests , '' Cameron told Canadian broadcaster CBC . BP said it has paid out $ 2.35 billion so far in clean-up and compensation costs related to the worst oil spill in U.S. history . That does not include the $ 20 billion oil spill fund it has agreed to set up , nor the billions of dollars it will have to pay in fines . Under the Clean Water Act , BP could potentially face penalties of at least $ 15 billion . `` This is a vital company for all of our interests . The view I take is that BP itself wants to cap the well and clean up the spill and compensate those who have had damages , '' Cameron said . `` It wants to do these things , it will do these things . I want to work with everyone concerned to try to make sure that out of all this there will still be a strong and stable BP , because it is an important company for all of us , '' he added . BP was once a predominantly British company but now has global operations and a major presence in the United States . Around 40 percent of its shareholder base is in Britain and a similar proportion is drawn from the United States . Kenneth Feinberg , the man appointed by Obama to oversee BP 's $ 20 billion compensation fund , said it made `` absolutely no sense '' to drive the company into bankruptcy . He was speaking at a public event in Larose , Louisiana . The well ruptured on April 20 when an explosion blew up an offshore rig on the surface above it , killing 11 workers . The spill has soiled the U.S. Gulf coastline and threatened multibillion dollar tourism and fishing industries . In London , its stock plunged 6.4 percent on Friday , trading at its lowest levels since 1996 , on talk it needs extra cash to fund the clean-up and worries about bad weather . On Friday , U.S.-listed shares dropped 6.1 percent , also to a 14-year low , on a rumor that analysts recommended the company sell stock . `` There was talk that a couple of Wall Street analysts had recommended the company do a $ 10 billion equity offering . Aside from all the other problems facing the company , if they issued shares now , it would represent dilution to current shareholders , '' said Michael Sheldon , chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport , Connecticut . A spokesman for BP said it had `` considerable firepower '' to meet the costs of the spill and denied market talk that the company was seeking bankruptcy protection . In the Gulf , BP said its oil-capture systems collected or burned off 23,725 barrels of oil on Thursday . U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who oversees the federal relief effort , said BP was on track to nearly double its oil collection capacity next week . `` We will have three vessels and 53,000 barrels a day of capacity by the end of June , '' he said . The U.S. government estimates between 35,000 -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- and 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the well . BP 's oil collection effort , which has been dogged by a series of mishaps including an underwater accident this week , faces a new threat -- stormy weather . Allen said it would be necessary five days ahead of the arrival of any gale force winds to start to take down the current operations involving ships and other equipment collecting some of the oil spewing from the ruptured well . Because of this , oil could flow unchecked from the ruptured well into the sea for up to 14 days , Allen said . Weather forecast models are divided on whether the system , now in the western Caribbean , will turn northwest toward Mexico , northeast toward the Florida Panhandle or north toward the central Gulf where BP is struggling to stop the spill . U.S. oil crude surged 3 percent , hitting a seven-week high , on worries the bad weather could potentially threaten Gulf oil production . The concerns also boosted U.S. natural gas futures by nearly 2 percent . BP said two relief wells that offer the best hope of plugging its well were on track to intercept their target at a depth of 18,000 feet . The wells are due to be completed in August . U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman , who blocked the Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , on Tuesday sold his holdings in Exxon Mobil Corp -LRB- XOM . N -RRB- , worth $ 15,000 or less , just four hours before he issued his ruling , according to information in a financial disclosure form released on Friday .

Spicer , who runs the restaurant Bayona in New Orleans ' French Quarter , is seeking class-action status on behalf of restaurants and others in the seafood industry that have suffered damage since the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . In a complaint filed late Friday in New Orleans federal court , Spicer 's lawyer Serena Pollack said the restaurants depend heavily on the availability of local seafood . Because of the spill , they expect to lose customers because of lower tourism and convention business , contamination fears and significantly higher prices , the 18-page complaint said . `` Much of plaintiff 's business is based on the unique quality of Louisiana seafood , as well as the chain of delivery of that resource from the initial harvester -LRB- be it fisherman , oyster grower or shrimper -RRB- , '' Pollack wrote . `` Because this chain of delivery can not be maintained , plaintiff 's business has been , and continues to be , materially damaged . '' BP spokesman Mark Salt said the British company does not comment on litigation . Bayona opened in 1990 , and according to its website has since 1995 been one of New Orleans ' top five restaurants in the Zagat Survey . Spicer has received a James Beard Foundation award , and appeared as a judge on Bravo 's `` Top Chef '' and Food Network 's `` Iron Chef America . '' She has also opened the New Orleans restaurants Herbsaint and Cobalt . The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages from BP .

The oil spill , which began on April 20 , has caused an economic and environmental disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast , threatening fisheries , tourism and wildlife . Tropical depression Alex moved into the southwestern gulf , prompting the closure of two key Mexican oil ports , and was likely on Monday to regain tropical storm status , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said . Forecasters expect Alex to make landfall again as a hurricane early on Thursday between Brownsville , Texas , and Tuxpan de Rodriguez Cano in Mexico , sparing BP 's oil collection efforts in the Gulf . The British newspaper the Sunday Times reported that BP 's drilling of relief wells , intended to plug its leaking deep-sea well , is going more quickly than expected and the company could stop the flow of oil in mid-July . That would be about two weeks earlier than BP 's current public projection of early August . The newspaper cited sources with knowledge of the operation . A BP spokesperson declined to comment on the report and referred to a company statement on Friday that the two relief wells -- begun on May 2 and May 16 -- were estimated to take approximately three months to finish . Louisiana 's fragile wetlands have been hardest hit by the oil but Mississippi had escaped damage until Sunday , although some oil had tainted its barrier islands . Oil has also come ashore in Alabama and Florida 's Gulf coast . Oil from the spill hit two tourist beaches at Ocean Springs , about 10 miles east of Biloxi , Mississippi , and a beach used by fishermen close to an inland marsh . Mississippi state officials and the U.S. Coast Guard , who said they expect more oil to arrive , were waiting on BP contractors to start cleaning up . `` We can not clean up or catch the oil until BP gets here . They have all of our people , '' said Earl Etheridge , a spokesman for Mississippi 's Department of Environmental Quality . Alex , the first named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , had sustained winds of 35 mph and was about 55 miles south-southwest of Campeche . The system was moving west-northwest at 9 mph . Even if it misses the spill area , large waves could hamper clean-up efforts from Louisiana to Florida from the spill . Shell Oil Co evacuated nonessential workers from production platforms and drilling rigs in U.S.-regulated areas of the Gulf oil fields on Saturday , anticipating Alex 's impact , and on Sunday shut subsea production at two platforms . Meteorologists predict a very active Atlantic hurricane season , which runs from June 1 to November 30 . The U.S. government estimates that up to 60,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- per day are spewing from BP 's damaged well on the seabed about a mile below the surface . While awaiting the completion of the relief wells to finally plug the leak , BP has been using two oil collection systems to prevent some of the oil from its ruptured well from spewing into the sea . BP said on Sunday its crews had collected or burned off 22,750 barrels of oil on Saturday . Equipment going to the leak site this week could raise daily collection to 53,000 barrels , officials say , and a review is scheduled of a system that may boost it to 80,000 barrels . The oil spill was a topic at a weekend meeting in Canada of leaders of the Group of 20 world 's biggest economies . G20 sources said the summit communique included a reference to the spill and urged the sharing of best practices to protect marine life , prevent accidents and deal with the consequences when accidents occur . Shares of BP have been savaged since the crisis started and fell another 6 percent to a 14-year low on Friday . The costs to BP include but are not limited to a $ 20 billion compensation fund it set up under U.S. pressure . BP said it has paid out $ 2.35 billion so far in clean-up and compensation costs .

We know this from an oil spill eight years ago in Buzzards Bay , Massachusetts . On April 27 , 2003 , eight years ago the Bouchard Barge B-120 hit an obstacle in Buzzards Bay , creating a 12-foot rupture in its hull and discharging an estimated 100,000 gallons of No. 6 oil . The oil is known to have affected an estimated 90 miles of shoreline , numerous bird species , and recreational use of the bay , such as shell fishing and boating . Why are all the efforts aimed at collecting oil from the well instead of just sealing it ? Additionally , the public has been told for weeks that `` all that can be done is being done , '' if that is the case , how are the efforts now being ramped up ?

HOUSTON\\/LONDON | Mon Jun 28 , 2010 6:17 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A growing storm delayed efforts to capture more oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico as BP Plc and Russia 's government traded words on Monday over the future of the energy giant 's chief executive . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , probing the exposure of big financial firms to the British energy giant , gave banks a `` passing grade , '' one source told Reuters . High waves from tropical storm Alex will delay BP 's plan to add more oil-siphoning capacity to its leaking well until next week , a company executive told reporters in Houston , while state officials said Alex would hinder clean-up efforts . Alex is the first in a new season of storms , raising concern about prolonged efforts to get control of the undersea leak that has spewed oil since April 20 , threatening fisheries , tourism and wildlife in four states along the U.S. Gulf Coast . Kent Wells , BP executive vice president of exploration and production , said the current siphoning systems should not be affected `` unless unfortunately a storm heads directly our way . '' But waves as high as 12 feet would delay hooking up a third system to capture oil , he said . In London , BP said Tony Hayward was still its CEO , with no change under discussion , after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said he expected the embattled boss to resign soon and Moscow to be told the name of his successor on Monday . Adding credence to BP 's statement , Sechin 's office said later that management changes were not raised when he met Hayward , who has been criticized over his response to the disaster and was in Russia to address Moscow 's worries about BP 's local operations in the leak 's wake . Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said Alex was expected to become a hurricane on Tuesday , with winds of 96-110 mph by late on Wednesday before striking near the Texas-Mexico border and moving inland . Shell shut subsea production at two platforms and BP evacuated some personnel from three platforms due to the threat of Alex , the companies said on Sunday . Florida officials said swells churned up by Alex would hinder clean-up operations . `` Over the next several days the winds and current are going to hamper some offshore operations and the current is going to be pushing things more onto shore , '' said state meteorologist Amy Godsey . While a hurricane could also interrupt BP 's efforts to cap the well , some specialists say the heavy weather could actually help mitigate environmental damage by dispersing the oil . U.S.-listed shares of BP rose about 3 percent in morning trade on Monday , the first session after a sell-off that sent the stock to a 14-year low , but faded in the afternoon to close just 0.3 percent higher . The shares , a staple of pension funds , have lost more than half of their value since the spill began two months ago and are down some 24 percent since the start of June . The New York Fed has been probing exposure to BP to ensure Wall Street and the global financial system would not be at risk if the oil giant buckles under the costs of the spill , according to two sources familiar with the matter . After poring over documents and asking banks about their exposure to BP over the past two weeks , the New York Fed found no systemic risk and had not asked firms to alter their credit relationships with BP , the sources told Reuters . `` The Fed gave banks ' exposure to BP a passing grade , '' said one of the sources on condition of anonymity . Beyond 's BP survival prospects , the examination underscores market uncertainty about how the spill 's staggering clean-up bill might affect Wall Street , a fragile economic recovery and the multitrillion-dollar energy market . BP said on Monday its spending to cap the well , clean up the spill and compensate those affected had accelerated to $ 100 million a day , bringing the total so far to $ 2.65 billion . The company has set up a $ 20 billion compensation fund under U.S. government pressure . Kenneth Feinberg , the independent administrator of the fund , has said it made `` absolutely no sense '' to drive BP into bankruptcy , while promising to streamline the claims process and even let some victims file online . BP 's earlier handling of compensation on its own came under fire as unduly bureaucratic and time-consuming . Feinberg expressed doubt on Monday that compensation could stretch as far as a New Orleans strip club that says it has lost business because the fishermen who are its customers are out of work due to the spill . `` I do n't think they 'll get money out of this fund , '' he said in an interview with Fox News , adding the $ 20 billion `` should be reserved for the most directly impacted claims . '' While Alex remained at a safe distance , people in southeastern Louisiana had more immediate concerns as lightning lit up the sky and a torrent of rain flooded roads . Some residents were also concerned about BP and the Coast Guard 's continued use of chemical dispersants . On Monday , crews sprayed the material far offshore using airplanes . Dispersants help oil dissolve within months , breaking it down into small particles that can be easily digested by organisms living in the Gulf . But they are controversial as the long-term health implications are not clear . The Environmental Protective Agency is studying the use of dispersants . `` They should stop using them , '' said Mary Tompkins of Nairn , Louisiana . Nalco , the company that makes the primary dispersant being used , Corexit , says the product is safe in the environment . `` I do n't believe that , '' Tompkins said . `` They need to stop . '' U.S. Senator George LeMieux , a Republican , toured Pensacola Beach on the Florida Panhandle before returning to Washington to file a bill aimed at loosening restrictions he said prevented more oil skimmers from helping clean up the Gulf . `` There are 2,000 skimmers in the United States , '' LeMieux said . `` Why they are not all here , makes no sense to me . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The real cause of this oil spill are the bleeding heart environmentalists who forced oil drilling out so far and so deep . If they let them drill where there is plenty of oil inland and in shallow waters , this would have been a minor spill and stopped very quickly . How ironic is it that this bleeding hearts so concerned about a tiny bit of damage to the environment -LRB- not proven -RRB- would be the cause of the biggest environmental disaster ion history ? But they wo n't take the blame , like Obumbler , they 'll just blame someone else . BP should be allowed to exist as a company solely to pay damages from the catastrophe they have created . British Petroleum should never be allowed to pay executive bonuses or dividends until the last person is fully indemnified . This discussion is now closed .

Forecasters said Alex was moving slowly away from Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . It is not expected to hurt current oil-capture systems at the BP oil spill or the company 's plans to drill a pair of relief wells intended to plug the leak by August , a BP executive told reporters in Houston . As a precautionary measure , Shell Oil Co , Exxon Mobil Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Apache Corp evacuated nonessential workers from platforms near Alex 's path . Shell also shut subsea production at the Auger and Brutus platforms over the weekend . Traders and brokers kept a close eye on Alex , but oil prices fell toward $ 78 per barrel on Monday as most forecasters predicted the storm would pass southwest of major U.S. offshore oil and gas installations in the Gulf of Mexico . A hurricane watch has been issued for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to La Cruz in Mexico . The ports of Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas , which handle 80 percent of all Mexico 's oil export shipping in the Gulf , have been closed since Sunday due to strong surf in the area . State-run oil giant Pemex said its platforms in the Campeche Sound continued to work normally on Monday although it suspended helicopter flights to and from the facilities . Pemex said it is monitoring wind and surf conditions caused by Alex. Its Isla del Carmen port , not essential for oil shipments , has been closed since Sunday night . Barbara Blakely , a spokeswoman for Shell , told Reuters the company was closely monitoring Alex 's advance in the Gulf but that its LNG plant in Altamira , Mexico was working as usual . The storm is due to make landfall again between Brownsville , Texas , and Ciudad Madero in Mexico at mid-week , mostly sparing BP oil collection efforts south of Louisiana . Alex , the first named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , had sustained winds of about 60 mph with higher gusts and was located about 85 miles west-northwest of Campeche , Mexico . The system was moving north-northwest at 7 mph . `` Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days and Alex is expected to become a hurricane on Tuesday , '' the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on its latest update . At least ten people were killed in Central America in accidents related to Alex , local authorities reported . Three people died in El Salvador from flooding , two others were killed in a landslide in Guatemala and five people were swept away by swelling rivers in Nicaragua , emergency officials told Reuters . Alex was expected to bring 3 to 6 inches of rain to the Yucatan Peninsula , southern Mexico and parts of Guatemala through Tuesday . Isolated torrents of up to 10 inches were possible over mountainous areas . Forecasters warned the rain could cause flash floods and mudslides . The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov 30 and meteorologists predict this year will be a very active one . Hurricanes feed on warm water and the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic are higher than usual this year . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . As we enter one of the most aggressive hurricane seasons on record , I can not even imagine what a hurricane would do with oil in the Gulf of Mexico . Dealing with oil on the beach is one thing , but what if we had to deal with it in our streets , in our businesses , in our homes ? What if we had to rescue humans covered in oil ? What if this is no longer isolated to just the Gulf Coast but found its way up the great rivers to our inner cities ? Now imagine if you will , the dispersants mixed with oil which could possibly cause untold diseases and catastrophic health hazards of a biblical proportion . It staggers the imagination , or is it prophetic ? What if we are dealing with the wrath of God ? The oil may actually make the affects of the hurricaine less severe .

The National Hurricane Center said tropical storm Alex would build into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season as it moved over southern Gulf waters . Ripple effects from Alex produced six-foot -LRB- 1.8-meter -RRB- waves and wind gusts of up to 20 miles per hour and were expected to last a couple of days , said Phil Grigsby of the National Weather Service in New Orleans . Offshore oil clean-up activity off the Louisiana coast was halted because of severe weather , the U.S. Coast Guard said . Controlled burns of oil on the ocean , flights spraying dispersant chemicals and booming operations were all stopped , said Coast Guard Petty Officer Kelly Parker . However , BP Plc 's oil-capture and relief well drilling continued at the site of the leak . Grigsby said the weather would also affect clean-up operations on beaches and marshes . Alex , forecast to strengthen into a hurricane later on Tuesday , was churning northwest across the southwestern Gulf and expected to come ashore near the Texas-Mexico border late Wednesday or early Thursday . BP spokesman Robert Wine said BP 's oil-capture and relief well drilling operations were continuing . `` That 's all big equipment , and it is n't as affected by the sea state , '' he said of three rigs and a drillship a mile above the leak . BP officials have said waves as high as 12 feet -LRB- 4 metros -RRB- would delay plans to hook up a third system to capture much more oil and officials in Florida said high surf would probably hamper clean-up efforts . BP 's market capitalization has shrunk by $ 100 billion since its Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank in 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,525 metros -RRB- of water on April 22 , two days after an explosion and fire killed 11 workers . But U.S.-listed shares of BP closed 2.29 percent higher at $ 27.67 on Tuesday on bargain-hunting . The shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began . `` It 's tough to say if the stock has bottomed because the political situation remains so fluid , but on a basis the stock is attractive , '' said John Brady , senior vice president at MF Global in Chicago . The stock 's weakness since the disaster has also sparked talk of a possible takeover bid . `` The spill is bad , but you need to remember that BP is a global company with a global business , and there 's strength elsewhere , '' Brady said . The oil spill crisis is in its 71st day with no firm end in sight . The economic and ecological costs to tourism , wildlife , fishing and other industries , already massive , continue to mount for four states along the U.S. Gulf coast . The lucrative tourism industry in the Gulf could be hard hit for years by a false perception the spill has ruined all the beaches , tourism officials said . U.S. government officials estimate 35,000 to 60,000 barrels are gushing from the blown-out well each day . BP 's containment system can handle up to 28,000 barrels daily . The planned addition would have raised that to 53,000 bpd . Senior U.S. officials were beating a path to the Gulf region , responding to criticism that President Barack Obama and his administration responded too slowly to the crisis . Tuesday 's visitors included Vice President Joe Biden . A U.S. appeals court set July 8 for oral arguments on the Obama administration 's request to stay a ruling that lifted its six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling . A federal judge blocked it at the request of drilling companies , saying the suspension was too broad and arbitrary . Polls have given Obama low marks for his handling of the disaster , although not as low as those given to BP . `` BP 's handling of the spill from a crisis management perspective will go down in history as one of the great examples of how to make a situation worse by bad communications , '' said Michael Gordon , of New York-based crisis PR firm Group Gordon Strategic Communications . Mistakes include downplaying the environmental damage , initially blaming others for the disaster and underestimating the amount of oil leaking , analysts say . As crude oil and dispersants float on the surface of the Gulf , crews are battling to keep it off beaches and away from wildlife breeding grounds . On Louisiana 's Bay Baptiste , winds whipped waves up about a foot high and white caps were visible in the distance as the outer bands of Alex began to move into the region . Several marshes were only partially boom-protected , with oil coating the bottom part of reeds as crabs covered in crude scurried on nearby marsh islands . The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30 and meteorologists predict this year will be very active , suggesting more problems for the oil spill clean-up effort . In Biloxi , Mississippi , BP spokesman Richard Judy acknowledged problems with clean-up operations after the state 's mainland was hit by oil . `` What 's keeping us busy in this area is maintaining boom , in some cases putting out new boom , doing pick-up of oiled material on the beaches when it gets there and also going out and working on the coastal islands , '' Judy said . `` Weather has been a problem . We have to be careful not to keep our crews on beaches if there 's lightning nearby . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Containment and closure would have been better but then the loss of profits by the top 2 % would have been unbearable . So , in keeping with the agenda of having the general population eat the garbage left by those who are presumed better human beings , we 'll just say `` how unfortunate that the hurrican season has n't been postponed . '' This is yellow journalism at its best . If there was n't an oil spill in the Gulf , nobody north of Brownsville would take a second look at Alex or any overzealous newscaster 's warning of `` coastal flooding '' on the north side or water churning in the Gulf . As a native southeast Texan , I 've been through my share of hurricanes and tropical storms , and I can safely say that I am not the least bit worried about Alex , `` coastal flooding '' north of South Padre Island or any effect that it `` might '' have on the BP oil spill . You just focus on getting that relief well drilled , BP , and those claims dispersed to the people who need them . This discussion is now closed .

On Tuesday representatives from those tribes toured Louisiana s marshland to see firsthand the impact from BP s oil leak , and to warn Gulf residents to be wary .

LONDON | Tue Jun 29 , 2010 10:21 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A week after one of his wells in the Gulf of Mexico began spewing crude into the sea , BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward visited the Reuters office in London . Initially anxious , the CEO relaxed and grew in confidence as he outlined his plans to halt the leak , peppering his conversation with industry slang like `` mods , '' short for `` modifications . '' His message over the lunch with senior journalists was clear : BP had one of the biggest engineering , logistical and financial problems the oil industry had ever faced , but the company was up to the challenge . What the CEO failed to mention was that BP also faced a massive political problem , perhaps the biggest such crisis for an oil company operating in the United States since Teddy Roosevelt broke up John D. Rockefeller 's Standard Oil . It was a telling omission . BP 's failure to grasp the fact that its biggest challenge was in Washington , not the Gulf , has led to a series of gaffes and strategic communications errors that have inflamed public opinion , fanned the political firestorm and dragged the company 's share price ever lower . Most analysts expect the spill cleanup to cost under $ 30 billion , but BP 's market capitalization is down $ 100 billion , on expectations it will face fines of up to $ 30 billion as well as curbs on its business in the United States , its most important market . It did n't have to be this way . `` BP 's handling of the spill from a crisis management perspective will go down in history as one of the great examples of how to make a situation worse by bad communications , '' said Michael Gordon , of New York-based crisis PR firm Group Gordon Strategic Communications . `` It was a combination of a lack of transparency , a lack of straight talking and a lack of sensitivity to the victims . When you 're managing an environmental disaster of this magnitude you not only have to manage the problem but also manage all the stakeholders . '' From the start , BP adopted positions that fueled suspicion . Hayward repeatedly told reporters in the first days after the rig drilling the doomed well exploded that `` it was n't our accident . '' Instead , the CEO blamed Transocean , the company that operated the drilling rig . `` In such an awful and public situation , to immediately blame someone else , even if you 're right , is bad from a public relations standpoint , '' said Henry Sneath , First Vice-President with DRI , an association of U.S. corporate defense lawyers . `` You immediately blacken your reputation and poison potential jurors that might ultimately rule on your faith . '' The company also failed to tackle its image as a serial safety and environmental offender . That was especially true in the United States where regulators had blamed both a 2005 refinery blast that killed 15 workers and pipeline leaks in Alaska in 2006 on cost-cutting . When a Congressional Committee in mid-May highlighted this record , BP insisted it had changed . But it could n't say how . `` BP 's inability to precisely describe the improvements it has made in its safety and operational culture took us by surprise , '' UBS said in a research note after the hearing . BP further weakened its credibility by underestimating the amount of oil leaking from its well . Even when scientists challenged the Coast Guard 's 5,000 barrel-per-day estimate of the flow rate , BP defended it robustly . On May 14 , Bob Dudley , BP 's director for the Americas , told MSNBC the 5,000 bpd figure was `` a good estimate '' and that calculations of up to 70,000 bpd were `` scaremongering . '' On June 15 , a government panel said the flow rate was actually up to 60,000 bpd and internal BP documents released by a U.S. Congressman last week showed BP had itself calculated the well could flow at up to 100,000 bpd . `` Once you 've lost trust and credibility , your ability to get your message across is critically hampered , '' said Jonathan Hemus , director of Insignia Communications . Then there were Hayward 's mistakes . Telling interviewers the spill was `` relatively tiny '' and that the environmental impact was likely to be `` very , very modest '' was interpreted as a crude attempt to downplay the spill 's impact . Even worse was Hayward 's comment on TV that he wanted his life back . Predictably , wives of some of the 11 men who died in the rig blast responded that they 'd like their husbands back . On June 25 , Hayward 's boss , the BP Chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg said Hayward was returning to the UK , admitting the CEO 's remarks had `` upset people . '' A day later , Hayward showed he could upset the U.S. public just as capably from the other of the Atlantic , when he was photographed aboard his yacht off the Isle of Wight as the oil spill confined fishermen in Louisiana to port . `` I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting , '' White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told ABC news after the yachting incident . What makes the mistakes even worse , is that BP should have been well placed to mount a world-class crisis PR effort . The firm had almost unlimited resources . Its chairman was a media-savvy former telecoms CEO . And its head of public relations , Andrew Gowers , was a former editor of the Financial Times , and one-time Reuters reporter , with recent experience of crisis management : Gowers headed Lehman Brothers PR team during its collapse , although the rapidity and breadth of the banking meltdown was such that no amount of PR could have saved the bank . Yet the oil giant had a key shortcoming . BP 's British CEO had never held a position in the United States , its Swedish chairman had limited U.S. experience , and Gowers ' only stint working in the United States was his few months with Lehman . Hayward exacerbated his lack of U.S. savvy by choosing another Briton , Alan Parker , head of the UK 's largest financial PR agency , Brunswick , as his external PR adviser . It was n't until late May before the company appointed a heavy-hitting U.S. PR representative -- Dick Cheney 's former spokeswoman , Anne Kolton . The lack of local knowledge hurt BP in those first few weeks . U.S. executives say that it is difficult for European executives , especially those who have n't spent a long time working in the United States , to understand the combatative political landscape there . `` In Europe , the attitude would be much more , ` the company is the only one who can solve the problem , so what do we need to do to help the company to get it sorted ? ' '' said Patrick Dunleavy , a professor of political science at the London School of Economics . `` The company did n't adequately gauge how much backlash there would be and how quickly it would be ... that was a really bad piece of risk management , '' he added . BP has also been caught out by a more hostile media than it is used to . For long the UK 's largest and most international business , BP 's success is a source of pride for a former imperial power which agonizes over its position in the world . To many in Britain , the CEO of BP is the patron saint of British business -- someone whose pronouncements on matters even outside the energy space can make the front pages . Even now , BP enjoys a reasonably positive press in Britain . But the role of U.S. television in reporting the disaster in has been a challenge for a media team more geared toward dealing with financial reporters whose professional readers care less about snappy sound-bites . BP would have faced public anger and political pressure no matter how slick its PR , of course . The question is : could it have handled the situation better ? `` PR is not the antidote to what 's happening here . Whenever something like this happens it is a 100 percent certainty that the public relations will be deemed to be botched , '' said Eric Dezenhall , a crisis PR specialist for almost 30 years , Washington-based Dezenhall said BP 's communications efforts must be judged over the longer term . `` All of these PR chestnuts that sound wonderful in a college class , about apologizing and contrition , there is very , very weak data to show these cliches bear out in reality .

'' That was a reference to Joseph Hazelwood , the Valdez captain who admitted to drinking vodka before the spill . He was convicted of negligent discharge of oil , a misdemeanor , and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service . The closest analogs in the United States may be the litigation over asbestos , which analysts have estimated has cost between $ 250 billion and $ 300 billion , and tobacco , whose bill is hard to determine given the many pending cases . But the Valdez disaster , which caused roughly 257,000 barrels , or 10.8 million gallons , to spill off the Alaska coast , does offer a glimpse into what analysts widely expect to be a grueling and extremely costly legal marathon for BP . Litigation dragged on for two decades as Exxon Mobil Corp fought over punitive damages , saying the $ 5 billion that an Alaska jury awarded in 1994 was excessive . A federal appeals court later cut that to $ 2.5 billion , and in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court slashed it to $ 507.5 million . Exxon 's costs for the Valdez are now estimated at roughly $ 4 billion . This includes more than $ 2 billion for cleanup , a $ 900 million civil penalty , a $ 125 million criminal penalty , and just over $ 1 billion for litigation with victims . BP will surely pay more -- a lot more . `` We 're looking at multibillion dollar criminal and civil penalties against BP , certainly record amounts under U.S. environmental laws , '' said David Uhlmann , a University of Michigan law professor and former chief of the U.S. Department of Justice 's environmental crimes section . BP may have helped itself by setting up a $ 20 billion escrow fund for victims , under pressure from a frustrated White House . That is `` the kind of post-incident conduct that the government wants to see , '' and could result in lower penalties later , Uhlmann said . But the legal road ahead remains arduous . As with the Valdez , experts say litigation could take up to 20 years , with the cost and negative publicity potentially bringing one of Britain 's largest companies to its knees . `` This situation screams out for accountability , '' said Mary Wood , director of the environmental and natural resources law program at the University of Oregon . `` We ca n't put a price tag on the liability until the damage ceases . '' Guessing BP 's ultimate liability for the worst oil spill in U.S. history has become something of a parlor game on both sides of the Atlantic . The company said on June 28 it had spent $ 2.65 billion so far on its response effort . With the first of two relief wells not expected to be ready until August , that total is certain to soar . Cleanup costs are likely to be only a small fraction of what the oil giant ends up paying . Analysts at Credit Suisse have said BP 's cleanup and legal costs could reach $ 37 billion . Goldman Sachs & Co analysts projected $ 33 billion . Raymond James & Associates analysts , noting a `` more plaintiff-friendly '' U.S. legal system in environmental cases , projected $ 62.9 billion , after taxes . Topping them all is Plater who , noting the millions of people who live on or near the Gulf coast , said the total could even reach $ 90 billion . A BP spokesman , Mark Salt , said the company does not discuss litigation . BP has denied bankruptcy is an option . BP 's potential costs have several components : cleanup expenses , civil penalties that depend on the size of the spill , and litigation with investors , businesses and municipalities . Criminal penalties are also possible , after Attorney General Eric Holder said on June 1 the Justice Department had opened a criminal and civil probe into BP 's actions . Already , lawsuits are pouring into courthouses almost as fast as tar balls are washing up onto beaches . More than 250 have been filed so far , and many seek class-action status . At least six have been filed on behalf of investors . Some allege violations of federal racketeering laws for scheming to conceal the danger of the drilling operations , and even for interfering with the claims process to delay or avoid payouts . The majority are intended to help the fishermen , charter boat captains , shippers , restaurants , resort operators and others who say their livelihoods have been damaged . One , filed by award-winning New Orleans chef Susan Spicer , is on behalf of restaurants that say customers are staying away because of rising seafood prices , contamination fears and lower convention and tourism activity . `` They were n't even prepared for an accident . So now , they are totally making it up on the fly , '' said Scott Summy , a lawyer at Baron & Budd PC in Dallas who represents 18 fishermen and other plaintiffs against BP . `` These acts play very well under various state common law theories , such as negligence or gross negligence , as well as federal statutes . '' Jeffrey Fisher , a Stanford Law School professor who represented fishermen and other Valdez spill victims before the U.S. Supreme Court in the Exxon case , said BP may try to limit the field of potential claimants . `` When you have a calamity like this that has so many secondary and tertiary effects , which seep into the economy and the well-being of local communities , the question is going to be where courts draw the line , '' he said . `` BP can argue it is only liable for hard economic losses , such as wages , '' Fisher went on . `` That will be a huge battleground . For example , someone told me that beach communities are losing out on huge amounts of tourism revenue . Is BP on the hook for any of that ? We do n't know . '' In 2009 , BP generated more than $ 27 billion of operating cash flow , and it ended March with $ 105 billion of assets net of liabilities . This suggests a large capacity to withstand evens tens of billions of dollars of spill costs . Even so , `` it 's hard for me to imagine anyone can suffer losses in the tens of billions of dollars and not notice it , '' said Roger Marzulla , a partner at Marzulla Law LLC in Washington and former head of the Justice Department environment and natural resources division . The BP spill could run afoul of several federal laws . The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires people seeking damages to contact the companies responsible for the spill to request compensation . Once they do , civil lawsuits can follow . Under the same act , responsible companies must also pay up to $ 1 billion for cleanup . It also caps liability to victims at $ 75 million , though not if gross negligence , willful misconduct or certain safety violations are found . Some lawmakers want the cap retroactively increased to $ 10 billion , or even abolished . Another law is the Clean Water Act , which allows liability of $ 1,100 per barrel spilled in waterways , but up to $ 4,300 per barrel if gross negligence is proven . If the amount of oil spilled in the Gulf matches that of the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc offshore well operated by Mexico 's Pemex -- previously North America 's worst offshore spill -- liability under this act could reach $ 15 billion . Other laws are also at play . Among them is the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 , which the drill rig operator Transocean Ltd sought to invoke because it limits potential payouts by ship owners . Another is the Refuse Act , which prohibits the dumping of refuse into waterways . Marzulla said BP could also face civil or criminal liability under three laws to protect wildlife . These are : the Endangered Species Act ; the Migratory Bird Treaty Act covering roughly 836 species ; and the Marine Mammal Protection Act covering dolphins and whales . Fines of $ 15,000 to $ 25,000 per violation are possible . Uhlmann , meanwhile , said the Alternative Fines Act lets the government seek criminal penalties equal to twice the loss associated with the oil . While it is impossible to believe BP wanted the spill to happen , investigators could argue that the company took shortcuts that made it inevitable . `` Your company conducted its planning as if an uncontrolled subsea blowout was n't even a possibility , '' Florida Representative Nancy Castor told BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward at a June 17 Congressional hearing . `` Why were n't you prepared ? Why did you elevate profits over safety ? '' `` I do n't believe we did elevate profits over safety , '' Hayward responded . BP 's recent U.S. safety record , however , is hardly pristine . Last year , it agreed to a $ 50 million criminal penalty for violating the Clean Water Act in connection with a 2005 Texas City refinery fire that killed 15 workers . It has also pleaded guilty to a Clean Water Act violation over the 2006 release of roughly 212,000 gallons of oil in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay . `` One of the things the government is looking at in this tragedy is : Did BP and others shoot straight about conditions at the well site before the explosion occurred , and since the spill began ? '' `` If the government concludes that BP intentionally misled it about construction at the site or the amount of oil gushing , it could bring obstruction of justice and false statement charges . '' A criminal conviction under the Clean Water Act would cause BP to be shut out of government contracts for a period of time , a procedure known as debarment . The company could also be barred from such contracts upon the entering of civil judgments over environmental law violations . BP has already faced partial bans on federal contracts because of past violations . For example , the company was ineligible for federally-funded contracts for services from the Texas and Prudhoe Bay facilities . Talks over those bans were halted after the Deepwater Horizon explosion . Plater , the former chairman of the Alaska oil spill task force , said the 11 deaths caused by the BP explosion are likely to result in a finding of criminal liability . He also noted that the size and location of the spill expose BP to far more costs than the Valdez did for Exxon . Plater said he would be `` very surprised '' if BP 's costs stopped at $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion , and that the sum `` could be two or three times that . '' `` This is not an attenuated 38,000 people on the coast of Alaska 4,000 miles away , '' he said . `` Harms are likely to be larger , with a population more than 100 times greater in the impact zone and much larger economies and coastal ecosystems . '' Michael Chalos , a partner at Chalos , O'Connor & Duffy LLP in Port Washington , New York who represented the Valdez captain Hazelwood , said criminal liability might turn on who at BP might have known of problems at the rig , and whether they had the capacity to fix them before the explosion . `` From a corporate standpoint , the lesson to be learned is what BP is doing , '' Chalos said . `` They have stepped up and acknowledged responsibility and are trying to do the right thing . But every corporation has some limit to its ability to pay . How much can BP afford before it ca n't afford any more ? '' One variable may be how Kenneth Feinberg assesses and pays victims ' claims as the administrator of BP 's $ 20 billion fund . Feinberg has said claims can be filed over lost wages and profits , business interruption , personal injuries and death . He also said it is essential to `` err on the side of the claimant '' in dispersing emergency funds , even if that results in the fund being depleted faster . `` You 've got to allow those payments to go out with less corroboration than you would if you 're giving a lump-sum payment that is the total compensation , '' Feinberg told CNN on June 21 . `` We 've got to ease the burden on these folks . '' Feinberg previously oversaw the disbursement of money to victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . To focus on BP , he will step down this summer as the U.S. Treasury Department 's `` pay czar '' for companies getting government help . Lawyers said a critical issue for BP is whether claimants seeking more than emergency compensation will be required to sign releases absolving the company from further liability . That could limit the scope of any litigation . Brian O'Neill , a partner at Faegre & Benson LLP in Minneapolis who won the $ 5 billion punitive damage award against Exxon , said Feinberg may have some tough calls to make . For example , he said one might easily conclude an operator of a beachfront hotel where oil has washed ashore could make a valid claim . But what of a beachfront hotel operator who has no oil damage , yet has suffered cancellations from customers worried that oil could come ashore ? Or perhaps a hotel operator two miles inland who has no oil damage but has lost customers ? `` How the administrator draws the lines as to who gets paid is the most interesting question right now , '' O'Neill said . Chalos said getting a payout from the fund may be the best course for victims with smaller claims . Referring to Exxon victims , he said : `` A lot of the people who had claims are no longer around , sadly . If you can get fairly compensated by working with BP , then you ought to go that route , if I were advising a claimant . '' BP could also limit its liability under the legal concept of `` contribution . '' Essentially a form of blame-shifting , this is where a responsible party like BP seeks to recover from other parties that may have had a hand in the disaster . In his Congressional testimony , Hayward said the government had named four responsible parties : BP , Transocean , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Mitsui & Co. . BP owns a 65 percent stake in the well , while Anadarko controls 25 percent and Mitsui 10 percent . Anadarko has a much smaller balance sheet than BP , and far less capacity to absorb big liabilities from the spill , which Chief Executive James Hackett said was `` preventable '' and resulted from BP 's `` reckless '' conduct . `` We will be looking at our contractual remedies , '' he said in an June 18 interview . `` We 're focusing on the fact that there appears to be gross negligence and willful misconduct . '' Lawyers said BP might also seek to recover from two other defendants : Cameron International Corp , which provided a blowout preventer , and Halliburton Co , in charge of cementing the oil well to stabilize its walls . `` Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations , '' Hayward said in a June 18 statement . Contribution lawsuits may be BP 's best hope to cap costs . `` The real fight will be between BP , Anadarko , Mitsui , Transocean and Halliburton , '' Uhlmann said . `` Billions of dollars of liability are at stake , and the other companies are not going to want to help BP pay . '' BP may also try to insist that any government settlements not carry onerous `` reopener '' provisions that allow regulators to seek additional payments for latent problems . Exxon 's $ 900 million settlement in 1991 with Alaska and the United States had a four-year `` reopener window '' letting the governments claim as much as an additional $ 100 million . A day before the window was to close on September 1 , 2006 , they demanded another $ 92 million . They are still pursuing it . In addition , BP may face battles over insurance . On May 21 , for example , Lloyd 's of London asked a federal court in Houston to disallow a possible $ 700 million BP claim for coverage through a Transocean policy , saying the policy covers pollution originating only above land and water lines . `` Because liabilities BP faces for pollution emanating from BP 's well are from below the surface and from BP 's well , those liabilities are not within the scope of the additional insured protection , '' the complaint said . One area where BP may not face enormous costs is punitive damages . For that it can thank the Exxon litigation . This is because the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in Exxon Shipping Co v. Baker that set punitive damages in the Valdez case at $ 507.5 million , equal to the amount of compensatory damages , set a standard that may limit recoveries from BP . `` A penalty should be reasonably predictable in its severity , '' Justice David Souter wrote for a 5-3 majority . -LRB- The Court 's ninth justice , Samuel Alito , recused himself because he owned Exxon stock . -RRB- `` Given the need to protect against the possibility -LRB- and the disruptive cost to the legal system -RRB- of awards that are unpredictable and unnecessary , either for deterrence or for measured retribution , '' Souter continued , `` we consider that a 1:1 ratio , which is above the median award , is a fair upper limit '' for punitive damages in maritime cases such as Exxon . It is unclear where the Court might stand if it ever considers the BP spill . Souter retired last year . Justice John Paul Stevens , who dissented in Exxon , just completed his final term . Any litigation will likely take years to arrive . In the interim , lower courts are expected to follow the Exxon ruling . Among the early battles will be over where to hear much of the litigation . Some judges have recused themselves from various spill lawsuits , presumably because of stock ownership . BP wants lawsuits tried in Houston , closer to its offices and perhaps a friendlier environment . It has even requested that a specific federal judge be assigned : Lynn Hughes , an appointee of President Ronald Reagan . According to the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary , which profiles judges based on unattributed comments from practicing lawyers , Hughes has `` very good legal ability , '' and also can be skeptical of claims by civil plaintiffs and the government . `` He hates plaintiffs and he hates the government , '' one plaintiff 's lawyer is quoted as saying . `` He is , by and large , a little on the defense side , '' said a civil defense lawyer , who then added : `` You can change his mind , but you have to have the ammunition . '' BP must also be careful to find juries capable of divorcing what they know and feel about the spill and can see on the news or web from the evidence presented to them . `` You can always get a jury , '' O'Neill said . `` They got one in Alaska . It took four days . '' The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation is expected to meet on July 29 in Boise , Idaho to consider how best to combine many of the overlapping lawsuits . Wherever it takes place , litigation will be protracted , as it has been in other areas where damages are often unknowable for years . Asbestos , for example , still generates litigation because while many companies had stopped using it for fireproofing and insulation by the mid-1970s , after-effects can take decades to surface . W.R. Grace & Co has spent nine years in bankruptcy court after asbestos prompted a Chapter 11 filing . Drug litigation also can take years . For example , Wyeth , now owned by Pfizer Inc , ultimately set aside more than $ 21 billion in a decade of litigation over the diet drug fen-phen , which was linked to heart valve damage . And then there are cigarettes , where decades of litigation reached a peak in 2000 when a Florida jury ordered tobacco companies to pay $ 145 billion in punitive damages to sick smokers . While the Florida Supreme Court later threw out that ruling , thousands of cases remain in the courts . `` We have examples in tobacco , asbestos and pharmaceuticals where funds are set up by third-party trustees , '' said Marzulla , the former Justice Department official . `` But those address one set of injuries , '' he went on . `` Here , it is much more complicated . There is no formula for how much fishermen , resort owners , beachfront property owners or others who make their livings in the bayou will be paid . '' Lawyers and analysts said a criminal penalty for BP could top the record $ 1.3 billion that Pfizer agreed to pay last September , as part of a $ 2.3 billion payout over marketing of the pain medicine Bextra . `` Could BP eventually get overwhelmed and go belly up ? Sure , it happened to a lot of companies with asbestos exposure , '' the energy investment boutique Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote this month . `` But only after losing a bunch of court battles . '' `` WE GO TO WAR OVER OIL '' O'Neill estimated that BP 's costs could reach $ 5 billion for cleanup , $ 4 billion for natural resources damages , and $ 10 billion in private lawsuits . Shareholder lawsuits , on the other hand , are perhaps `` not worth very much , '' given what he called the government 's interest in keeping BP not only solvent but healthy . `` Oil is necessary to the country -- we go to war over oil -- so we do n't want to put a major oil transactor out of business , '' he said . `` The one thing that could screw it up for BP is if the administrator for the fund does n't pay out money quickly . It will be a major disaster for both the -LRB- Obama -RRB- administration and BP , and keep this thing churning . '' What if , however , damages did reach the $ 90 billion that Plater suggested . Could BP handle that ? `` No , '' Plater said , `` but there could be contribution , and an attaching of assets . It could also teach someone about government . Mr. Reagan said the best government is the least government . In this case , we need government , but we need good government to avoid the collusive partnership our commission determined had made the Exxon Valdez incident inevitable . '' The administration of President Barack Obama may also want to ensure that any settlement with BP positions the government well in future litigation , according to Wood from the University of Oregon . `` When a private company harms a public resource , like the ocean or beach , they are liable , '' she said . `` Each fish , for example , gets a price tag . The crux is that the government is a trustee of public property that has been damaged . It has the absolute duty to make the people 's trust whole again , and get the last penny out of BP in the form of damages . '' What the government can not do is restore the Gulf of Mexico to its pre-April 20 state , just as it could not restore the Alaskan waters and roughly 1,300 miles of coastline to where they were before anyone knew Exxon had a vessel called Valdez . `` The lesson of both of these things , not so much from a legal level , is that we 're not able to respond to massive oil spills , '' Stanford Law 's Fisher said . `` The only solution is prevention . It 's not response , and it 's not legal action .

More than 10 weeks into the crisis , oil continued spewing into the Gulf , clean-up success remained limited and a proposal by the Obama administration to halt all deep-water drilling for the next six months remained in limbo . Washington 's attention has also been distracted by the recent firing of U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal as commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan and the fate of a huge financial reform bill . This week nature added to the problems as Alex crossed the Gulf . The storm made landfall as a hurricane over northeastern Mexico well to the west of the spill site , but its high winds and rough seas thwarted plans by BP to expand the volume of oil it is siphoning from the well . The bad weather also pushed more oil-polluted water onto the shoreline of the U.S. Gulf Coast and forced the halt of skimming , spraying of dispersant chemicals and controlled burns of oil on the ocean surface . `` It has brought in oil , unfortunately , from the panhandle of Florida to Louisiana , right now , at a higher rate than it has been over the last few days , '' Robert Dudley , chief of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration efforts , said of the storm 's effect in a live PBS online interview . He said the storm had spawned waves of 8 to 12 feet in some parts of the Gulf . The worst oil spill in U.S. history , entering its 73rd day on Thursday , has unleashed an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions along the Gulf Coast , idling much of the region 's fishing and tourism industries , soiling its beaches and marshlands and killing wildlife . Millions of barrels of crude oil have gushed nonstop from the floor of the Gulf , about 50 miles off Louisiana , since an April 20 explosion that demolished the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and killed 11 crewmen . BP says the target date for two relief wells to intercept and plug the blown-out well remains early to mid-August . The British energy giant drew harsh criticism earlier in the crisis , but some of the political heat has cooled since President Barack Obama pressured the company to set up a $ 20 billion fund for damages and lawmakers hammered BP executives at congressional hearings . In Washington on Thursday , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to give families of those killed in the oil rig explosion greater latitude to sue for damages . And the House Transportation Committee met to negotiate proposed legislation to hold vessels and facilities more accountable for oil spills . The White House , meanwhile , said it expected to release details of a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium in the next few days . A federal court order last week blocked the government 's initial ban on drilling exploratory and development wells in waters more than 500 feet deep , and a revised plan could still face legal challenges . In an interview with Reuters , International Energy Agency head Nobuo Tanaka said a moratorium `` makes sense '' while a presidential commission investigates the spill 's cause . But he said the world still relied on oil and gas , and that rigs idled in the Gulf should leave to search for resources elsewhere . BP 's market capitalization has shrunk by about $ 100 billion and its shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began . But shares have shown signs of stabilizing . They closed nearly 2 percent higher in New York on Thursday , after ending the day up almost 3 percent in London . Pacific Investment Management Co. -LRB- PIMCO -RRB- , which manages the world 's biggest bond fund , said on Thursday it is buying more debt of some of the companies involved in the oil spill disaster , though it did not cite specific corporations . Separately , Mark Kiesel , head of the PIMCO corporate bond portfolio management group , wrote in an article that BP had hefty amounts of cash on hand , strong operating cash flow and could sell assets to raise money if needed . In the Gulf of Mexico , seas were still too rough on Thursday to allow skimming to resume , and Coast Guard officials said they doubted it would be calm enough on Friday , either . `` The weather today , unfortunately , looks much the same as yesterday . Operations will likely be curtailed , '' Coast Guard Commander Charles Diorio said on a conference call . `` We expect the seas to start to calm down as we get into Friday and further into the weekend , '' Diorio said . In bays and estuaries , work crews were replacing boom dislodged or damaged by the storm , but the Coast Guard had no estimate on the extent of damage . The storm surge from Alex also pushed oil more toward the northwest , in the direction of Mississippi and Louisiana , after a week in which the slick had crept mainly toward the northeast , washing up on Florida Panhandle beaches . The weather delayed BP plans to boost containment capacity at the undersea well , but relief well drilling continued . A government spokeswoman said on Thursday a massive ship converted into a `` super skimmer '' had arrived in the Gulf to assist with the cleanup . The 1,100-foot -LRB- 335 meter -RRB- vessel , dubbed the `` A Whale , '' was provided by its owner , TMT Shipping of Taiwan , officials said . Government officials estimate 35,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- of oil pour from the ruptured wellhead each day . BP 's containment systems can handle up to 28,000 barrels daily and its planned addition could raise that to 53,000 . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

Only about 10 kilotons of nuclear explosion capacity and the problem is solved . '' A nuclear fix to the leaking well has been touted online and in the occasional newspaper op-ed for weeks now . Washington has repeatedly dismissed the idea and BP execs say they are not considering an explosion -- nuclear or otherwise . But as a series of efforts to plug the 60,000 barrels of oil a day gushing from the sea floor have failed , talk of an extreme solution refuses to die . For some , blasting the problem seems the most logical answer in the world . Mikhailov has had a distinguished career in the nuclear field , helping to close a Soviet Union program that used nuclear explosions to seal gas leaks . Ordinarily he 's an opponent of nuclear blasts , but he says an underwater explosion in the Gulf of Mexico would not be harmful and could cost no more than $ 10 million . That compares with the $ 2.35 billion BP has paid out in cleanup and compensation costs so far . `` This option is worth the money , '' he says . And it 's not just Soviet boffins . Milo Nordyke , one of the masterminds behind U.S. research into peaceful nuclear energy in the 1960s and '70s says a nuclear explosion is a logical last-resort solution for BP and the government . Matthew Simmons , a former energy adviser to U.S. President George W. Bush and the founder of energy investment-banking firm Simmons & Company International , is another calling for the nuclear option . Even former U.S. President Bill Clinton has voiced support for the idea of an explosion to stem the flow of oil , albeit one using conventional materials rather than nukes . `` Unless we send the Navy down deep to blow up the well and cover the leak with piles and piles and piles of rock and debris , which may become necessary ... unless we are going to do that , we are dependent on the technical expertise of these people from BP , '' Clinton told the Fortune\\/Time\\/CNN Global Forum in South Africa on June 29 . Clinton was picking up on an idea mooted by Christopher Brownfield in June . Brownfield is a one-time nuclear submarine officer , a veteran of the Iraq war -LRB- he volunteered in 2006 -RRB- and now a nuclear policy researcher at Columbia University . He is also one of a number of scientists whose theories rely not on nuclear bombs -- he did toy with that thought for a while -- but on conventional explosives that would implode the well and , if not completely plug it with crushed rock , at least bring the flow of oil under control . `` It 's kind of like stepping on a garden hose to kink it , '' Brownfield says . `` You may not cut off the flow entirely but it would greatly reduce the flow . '' Using nuclear blasts for peaceful ends was a key plank of Cold War policy in both the United States and the Soviet Union . In the middle of last century , both countries were motivated by a desire to soften the image of the era 's weapon of choice . Washington had big plans to use peaceful nuclear explosions to build an additional Panama Canal , carve a path for an inter-state highway through mountains in the Mojave Desert and connect underwater aquifers in Arizona . But the experimental plans were dropped as authorities learned more about the ecological dangers of surface explosions . The Soviet program , known as Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy , was launched in 1958 . The project saw 124 nuclear explosions for such tasks as digging canals and reservoirs , creating underground storage caverns for natural gas and toxic waste , exploiting oil and gas deposits and sealing gas leaks . It was finally mothballed by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 . The Soviets first used a nuclear blast to seal a gas leak in 1966 . Urtabulak , one of its prized gas-fields in Uzbekistan , had caught fire and raged for three years . Desperate to save the cherished reserves , Yefim Slavsky , then Minister of Light Industry , ordered nuclear engineers to use the most powerful weapon in their arsenal . `` The Minister said , ` Do it . Explode it , ' '' recalls Albert Vasilyev , a young engineer and a rising star in the project who now teaches at the Lenin Technical Institute in Moscow . Vasilyev remembers the technology behind the program with obvious pride . `` The explosion takes place deep underground , '' he says . `` We pinch the pipe , break it and the pipe collapses . '' According to Vasilyev , the blast at Urtabulak sealed the well shut leaving only an empty crater . In all , the Soviets detonated five nuclear devices to seal off runaway gas wells -- succeeding three or four times , depending on who you talk to . `` It worked quite well for them , '' says Nordyke , who authored a detailed account of Soviet explosions in a 2000 paper . `` There is no reason to think it would n't be fine -LRB- for the United States -RRB- . '' But not everything went smoothly . Vasilyev admits the program `` had two misfires '' . The final blast in 1979 was conducted near the Ukrainian city of Kharkov . `` The closest houses were just about 400 meters away , '' Vasilyev recalls . `` So this was ordered to be the weakest of the explosions . Even the buildings and the street lamps survived . '' Unfortunately , the low capacity of the device failed to seal the well and the gas resurfaced . Alexander Koldobsky , a fellow nuclear physicist from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute , insists the peaceful nuclear explosions were safe . The people who worked on the program `` were brilliant professionals '' , he says . `` They had a culture of safety , which did not accept the word ` maybe ' , but only accepted the words ` obligation ' and ` instruction . ' Any derivation from these in nuclear technologies is a crime . '' Still , he concedes , `` there were different scenarios of what happened after an explosion . '' At his first blast in a Turkmen gas field in 1972 , `` the stench was unbearable , '' he says . `` And the wind was blowing toward a nearby town . '' He closes his narrow lips into a smile as if refusing to say more . Koldobsky shrugs off any suggestion of fear or emotion when the bomb exploded . `` I felt nothing . I was just doing my job . '' Not everybody is so sanguine about the Soviet experience . Speaking on condition of anonymity , an expert from Russia 's largest oil exporter Rosneft , urges the United States to ignore calls for the atomic option . `` That would bring Chernobyl to America , '' he says . Vladimir Chuprov from Greenpeace 's Moscow office is even more insistent that BP not heed the advice of the veteran Soviet physicists . Chuprov disputes the veterans ' accounts of the peaceful explosions and says several of the gas leaks reappeared later . `` What was praised as a success and a breakthrough by the Soviet Union is in essence a lie , '' he says . `` I would recommend that the international community not listen to the Russians . Especially those of them that offer crazy ideas . Russians are keen on offering things , especially insane things . '' Former Minister Mikhailov agrees that the USSR had to give up its program because of problems it presented . `` I ended the program because I knew how worthless this all was , '' he says with a sigh . `` Radioactive material was still seeping through cracks in the ground and spreading into the air . It was n't worth it . '' `` Still , '' he says , momentarily hard to see through a cloud of smoke from his cigarettes , `` I see no other solution for sealing leaks like the one in the Gulf of Mexico . '' The problem , he goes on , is that `` Americans just do n't know enough about nuclear explosions to solve this problem ... But they should ask us -- we have institutes , we have professionals who can help them solve this . Otherwise BP are just torturing the people and themselves . '' Nordyke too believes the nuclear option should be on the table . After seeing nine U.S. nuclear explosions and standing behind the control board of one , he estimates that a nuclear bomb would have roughly an 80 to 90 percent chance of successfully blocking the oil . According to his estimates , it would have to be an explosion of around 30 kilotons , equivalent to roughly two Hiroshima bombs or three times as big as Mikhailov 's estimate . The explosion would also need to remain at least 3 to 4 miles away from other offshore wells in the area . The bomb , says Nordyke , would be dropped in a secondary well approximately 60-70 feet away from the leaking shaft . There it would create a large cavity filled with gas . The gas would melt the surrounding rock , crush it and press it into the leaking well to close it shut . Although the BP well is thousands of feet deeper than those closed in the Soviet Union , Nordyke says the extra depth should n't make a difference . He also says that so far below the ground , not much difference exists in onshore or underwater explosions -- even though the latter have never been tried . Nordyke says fears that radiation could escape after the explosion are unfounded . The hole would be about 8 inches in diameter and , despite the shockwave , the radiation should remain captured . Even in the case of radiation escape , he says , its dispersed effect would be less than that of floating oil patches . But do n't expect an explosion under the Gulf of Mexico any time soon . Even a conventional blast could backfire and cause more problems . There is a chance any blast could fracture the seabed and cause an underground blowout , according to Andy Radford , petroleum engineer and American Petroleum Institute senior policy adviser on offshore issues . The U.S. Department of Energy has no plans to use explosives `` due to the obvious risks involved , '' according to a DOE spokeswoman . There 's also the question of time . Preparations for a nuclear explosion could take up to half-a-year ; BP has said it will have a relief well in place to stop the leak by August . `` I think it has to be considered as only the last resort , '' Nordyke says . But `` they ought to be thinking about it . '' Would he be willing to work on such an operation ? `` I 'd be happy to help , '' he says . -LRB- Reporting by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya and Ben Judah in Moscow and Alina Selyukh in Washington ; editing by Simon Robinson and Sara Ledwith -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

S. Coast Guard\\/Handout\\/Files NEW ORLEANS | Sun Jul 4 , 2010 12:13 am BST NEW ORLEANS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A supertanker adapted to scoop up oil from the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico began tests Saturday amid a report that some major investors expect the energy giant to replace its top executives . The vessel named `` A Whale '' and dubbed a `` super skimmer '' is operating just north of the blown out well as part of a two-day test watched by the U.S. Coastguard , said Bob Grantham , spokesman for TMT Shipping Offshore , which owns the ship . If all goes to plan TMT hopes to sign a clean-up contract for the ship , which can remove up to 500,000 barrels -LRB- 21 million gallons -RRB- of oil and water mix from the sea surface a day , according to crew members . Efforts by BP to contain the damage returned to normal after a hurricane and the British company said its oil-capture systems at its leaking well collected or burnt off 25,290 barrels of oil during operations Friday . The storm passed through the spill area off the coast of Louisiana without doing major damage . But the corporate fall-out from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history appeared far from over . The Financial Times newspaper reported BP investors expected to see a change in the company 's leadership , possibly once the leak is capped , with both Chief Executive Tony Hayward and Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg in jeopardy . `` When this is over there will be a full investigation , and we would expect some action to replace the top team , '' the British newspaper quoted a top 10 UK shareholder as saying in its Saturday edition . Without steps to steady the ship , BP could become a takeover target of companies like ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell or PetroChina , the FT said , citing a source working on BP 's strategy . A BP spokesman declined to comment . BP 's market capitalization has shrunk by about $ 100 billion -LRB- 65.7 billion pounds -RRB- and its shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began . Company executives have been under intense pressure since an April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and unleashed the torrent of oil now threatening wildlife and the tourist and fishing industries in the Gulf region . The Obama administration has also criticized the company 's response to the crisis , now in its 75th day . The U.S. Interior Department , one of the departments spearheading Washington 's response to the spill , could issue a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium for U.S. waters in the coming week . A federal court last week lifted a six-month drilling ban imposed by the Obama administration as a result of the spill . The new moratorium is expected to be more flexible and could be adjusted to allow drilling in certain subsea fields . The supertanker works by allowing polluted water to enter 12 horizontal slits near its port and starboard bow . The liquid then enters a series of tanks where the oil is decanted and then stored for later transfer to a separate vessel . Test results are due Monday , Grantham said , but crew members are confident of success because of a previous test off the coast of Portugal where the ship was fitted out and because the process follows established principles of physics . The total amount of oil and water mix from the spill remains unknown but the ship could in theory greatly boost the amount being collected each day . Apart from economic damage , the spill is seen as an environmental catastrophe for the Gulf coast . Whale sharks , the biggest fish in the sea , may be the latest victims . Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported this week that four of the polka-dotted creatures , stretching about 40 feet -LRB- 12 metres -RRB- in length , had been spotted swimming in oily water in search of food . Since whale sharks are filter feeders -- scooping up plankton and small fish as they swim just beneath the surface -- scientists are concerned they could be harmed or killed from swallowing large amounts of oil . `` The problem is that these are surface feeding animals and if they digest the oil they will sink and we will not know how many are dying , '' said Dr. Eric Hoffmayer of the University of Southern Mississippi . `` I do n't think there is any question we 're going to lose whale sharks to this oil spill . That 's why we need to tag these sharks so that we can determine how they are impacted by the oil , '' Hoffmayer told Reuters Friday .

As commenter hsvkitty points out , BP only got the permits to start drilling at the Deepwater Horizon site in the first place because the Minerals Management Service believed their statement that they could recover 197 percent of the daily discharge from an uncontrolled blowout of 250,000 barrels per day : a March report from BP said that it had the capacity to skim and remove 491,721 barrels of oil per day . Even after the explosion , BP was still insisting that it had `` skimming capacity of more than 171,000 barrels per day , with more available if needed . '' So far , it has managed to skim less than 900 barrels per day . Add burn-offs , and you get to just over 300,000 barrels in total , over 77 days -- that 's less than 4,000 barrels per day . BP 's reaction to being massively wrong , by a factor of over 100 , is to grab onto the biggest numbers it can find -- to try , in other words , to deal with the optics , rather than the reality . Take the much-vaunted super-skimmer , for instance . Some reports say that it `` can collect up to half a million barrels of oil a day '' , but it 's much more accurate to say that it can theoretically collect that many barrels of contaminated water , which is only about 10 % oil . And , as Kindy drily notes , `` thus far , it has been unable to produce those results in the gulf . '' BP knew full well that a blow-out at the Deepwater Horizon site would involve oil bubbling up to the surface from miles below sea level , rather than being spilled directly onto the surface from a tanker . But it never seemed to stop to think that much of the oil would never surface . BP also said that much of its skimming capacity would come from outsourcing skimming operations to Marine Spill Response -- but BP never asked MSR whether they could hit its marks , and neither did MMS , when BP submitted its insanely overoptimistic numbers . All of which is a sign of the knee-jerk credulity that most of us exhibit when faced with a large and seemingly highly accurate number . 491,721 , you say ? Well , that must be true -- or at least in the ballpark . It would be interesting to compare that number with other oil companies ' projections of their oil-skimming capacity in the Gulf . Their rigs have n't exploded , of course , but what did they say they could skim off in the event that the unthinkable were to happen ? In hindsight , it seems that any number over a few thousand barrels per day would clearly have been a massive overestimate . But of course the bigger the number submitted , the easier it was to get the necessary approvals . You can see why BP exaggerated so much , and why there would have been enormous incentives for its rivals to do likewise . and then there are the restrictive labor and environmental rules that exacerbated the situation . You 'd think that if your coastline was facing imminent doom , you would accept help from whoever was willing to provide it . so when we learn that the numbers submitted were BS , what 's our ability to sue or criminally prosecute based on such lies ? @milesk , I was wondering the same thing myself . After all , I am criminally liable if I file a false tax return . And `` everyone else is doing it '' has n't worked for me since the first grade . I would think that it would be criminal charges against the corporation , rather than one or more individuals . However , when a corporate entity is involved , there is usually a bit of wiggle room , such as a deferred prosecution agreement . Ultimately , my guess is that even if it were possible , there is no appetite for bringing BP down . Seems like this would be another great piece of evidence for the criminal case -LRB- with unlimited liabilities on a per barrel basis -RRB- that the DoJ is building . Also , `` A Whale '' was initially turned down by BP and the Coast Guard -LRB- hell , it was only hastily retrofitted in the Netherlands to perform this skimming duty . -RRB- Come on Americans , this is your backyard ! This is an upward flow against gravity that pulls down . It can be stopped by some easy tricks on fluid dynamics using concepts of surface transport of particles . Bubbling flow upward can be clogged by high density objects coming down by gravity pull . Instead of doing a junk shot with gulf balls and shredded tires they were supposed to put high density and sinking geometry to clog the well . We do it a lot in Soil Science and the Dust Bowl provides insights on surface transport of particles by erosion regarding detachment , transport , and deposition . Hydrology is being curbed in the patenting affairs and technological development deeply missing now to solve simple problems like clogging a spilling well . The use of golf balls in the junk shot is a clear evidence that the experts have no handle on deep Hydrology . I am not surprised since a sort of scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being constantly violated by lay people as Patent Examiners , Patent Attorneys , and Scientists . Try to find any address of wick\\/wicking on Hydrology textbooks and you will see that this oil spill is something that could have been stopped on the day ONE if science were respected and honored . This OIL SPILL is a consequence of a bunch of people pretending to be smart overstepping the boundaries of a classic science called HYDROLOGY . Mr. Obamas assigned Dr. Regina Benjamin 42 lbs overweight to take care of your health system . A person near obese in the health system that can not help herself is going to provide Americans insights to shed weight and be healthy . This way Americans are becoming 85 % obese by 2040 . I suggested Mr. Obama to resign because my advanced breakthrough scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being violated by flawed patents that even do not work . Why to ignore science ? Just imagine if the well could be clogged in few hours by appropriate approach making gravity pull heavy objects downward on a bubbling upward flow with variable flow velocity due to the dragging effect of well casing . The relief wells may not work as clay in the mud can only clog tiny pores but fail on cracks and fissures . I believe this entire nightmare is preventable and consequence of a failing leadership you have . How would I stop the spill ? Easily running some trials with a visible display employing translucent 22 in pipes with similar upward flow and check the dragging effect on many particle sizes and formats . The bubbling effect should increase fall by reducing the fluid density , as well as variable radial flow velocity which is higher in the center and lower around the containment case as a stationary surface . When we start injecting the junk shot we know what to expect and change the particles sizes and formats as the velocity of spill reduces by the this downward effect from the falling particles . Lower and lower velocity suggests smaller and smaller particles until clay can be used to seal tiny pores inside the well lumen . What am I charging for it ? I just want USPTO to stop violating my scientific discovery US pat . 6,766,817 with flawed patents that even do not work shamefully harming and dishonoring HYDROLOGY . I got PhD at Penn State University and Bill Clinton was the speecher of my commencement on May 10 , 1996 . CNN is controlling info by removing comments on its website . I am curious who takes advantages by this ongoing catastrophe . There was\\/is a lot of research completed , but like most things the cleanup was self regulatory and permits given at their word . Are other oil companies as wrecklass in their estimates ? I hate to answer your question with a question ... but here it is ... Clueless and inept is really the only way to describe the ongoing situation at MMS , said Mike Senatore , vice president for Conservation Law at Defenders of Wildlife . This agency is at the epicenter of the worst environmental disaster in our nation s history and yet it s still going about business as usual . How else do you explain MMS s approval of the right to drill hundreds of new wells in the Gulf , including 13 for BP , based on the same fundamentally flawed and patently illegal environmental documents used to green-light the Deepwater Horizon operation ? The most recent lease was handed out on June 10 and all over-state their capacity for clean up , hastily handed out to beat the moratorium . Now that the MMS has been renamed `` The New Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation , and Enforcement -LRB- BOEMRE -RRB- things are bound to get better . It 's hard to keep your foot on somone 's throat when you got your hands in their wallet . . A huge boodoogle by the Obama admin and BP . There are many good and better solutions that be implemented by the more experienced professionals , but BP has to save face and the Obama conies are too inept to make a difference . This mess has turned into an colossal disaster . The worst part of it is we can not fix it until Obama is removed from office . I hear that BP shareholders are planning to sue the US gov bc BP did not use the safety equipment which was developed after the 1988 Piper Alpha explosion -LRB- google it -RRB- , which is mandatory in most of the world . The US gov standards are lax and thus caused the spill , wiping out shareholder value , so they are seeking compensation makes sense . ? In this deregulated world of ours , there 's a whole lot of skimming going on . Just not much of it actually helping clean up carelessly spilled oil , or any of the other greasy lubricants of inhumane unkindness . Truth is , things wo n't get a whole lot better until guys in expensive suits can be reduced to tears over every last drop of milken spillage they have wrought . Spill response plans are designed to fail because they emphasize the amount of oil that can be pumped rather than the amount of area that can be covered by skimming systems . Spills spread very quickly to a very thin average oil layer , much less than 1 mm average thickness , so the real problem is concentrating the oil so the it can be recovered faster than it spreads . Regulators must first account for the spreading of spills in high currents and severe weather and only then approve the skimming systems that can reliably and quickly cover the large areas predicted by spill dispersion models . There are fast skimmers that can be configured to safely operate in high seas but they are not used because regulators only calculate the theoretical oil pumping rate when approving response plans . For example , BP claimed its skimmers could recover 491,000 bbl\\/day but they actually recovered less than 900 bbl\\/day , more than 545 times less than claimed . Once the industry is compelled to use the ASTM F1780-97 methodology or the NOAA Mechanical Equipment Calculator , that factor in the area that can be covered by skimming systems , we 'll have a much more effective spill response capability . BP has been denied by US companies to use Piper Alpha and later equipment . The US companies use existing laws to block assistance . To skim and recover 500 000 bbl per day would be a huge operation -- that is a new VLCC -LRB- tanker -RRB- every 4 day . But , remove the drilling turret on a FPSO , and you have the device -- of course , not invented in the `` land of the brave '' . What to do with the recovered crude remains to be addressed , because a refinery can not take it since the condensates will have evaporated . There has been a similar disaster further south . PDVSA in Venezuela lost an oil rig on one of their -LRB- wet-gas -RRB- fields . But with safety regulations in place , identical to the North Sea , not a pint was spilled , nobody was killed -- but the rig sank . Just as when a person is about to drown at sea , he should not deny help because `` I only want to be saved by Pamela Anderson as in Baywatch '' . When you drown -- your relatives have no sympathy here -LRB- or anywhere else -RRB- . They will admit that silliness killed you . The same is the law in the Mexican Gulf : deny help and do not blame anyone later . BP and USCG have been employing an `` Out-of-Sight , Out-of-Mind '' strategy with the excessive use of dispersants and media control and restriction . The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan , more commonly called NCP , is the federal government s blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases . Pursuant to NCP Section 300.310 , As appropriate , actions shall be taken to recover the oil or mitigate its effects . Of the numerous chemical or physical methods that may be used , the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with protecting public health and welfare and the environment . Sinking agents shall not be used . Sinking agents means those additives applied to oil discharges to sink floating pollutants below the water surface . The question is whether BP s dispersants are sinking agents when they are applied a mile underwater at the source of the well leak . BP and USCG are knowingly and systematically underestimating the size of the spill to limit the financial impact on the oil company . Under the CWA , the company faces fines of up to $ 4,300 for each barrel spilled . Furthermore , pursuant to Section 2702 of OPA 90 , BP may be required to pay royalties -LRB- 18.75 % -RRB- owed to the federal government for the oil gushing from the well . For a clear understanding of the issues involved , visit : Collection of the BP oil spill has never been a `` skimming '' operation . This `` spill '' is a gusher of oil being released from the seafloor , approximately one-mile below the sea surface . USCG is using conventional skimmers , boom and dispersants normally deployed for inland waterway surface oil spills . BP and USCG will eventually use tankers to collect the oil that has been released into the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the Deepwater Horizon blowout of April 20 , 2010 . Unfortunately , this decision will be made after the devastation of many coastal communities . The blowout of April 20 , 2010 aboard the Deepwater Horizon was clearly preventable . The fact that the BP oil spill has been allowed to reach coastal areas is inexcusable .

The prospect of an earlier completion of the well , seen as the most promising way to plug the oil leaking from BP 's blown-out undersea well , could help bolster the energy giant 's battered shares , which rose about 9 percent in New York trade . But Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters in Houston that crews were still aiming to finish drilling two relief wells in mid-August , and he shot down speculation that the first of the two wells could plug the leak in July . BP shares continued a recent rally after the British energy giant said it could cover the costs of the spill without selling new shares , despite reports it was talking to government-owned funds in the Middle East about buying a stake to ward off takeover attempts . `` Any positive news as far as expediting what they 've been trying for a long time now will be a further catalyst for buyers to get in , '' said Alan Lancz , president at Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc in Toledo , Ohio . '' ... anything that would speed up the process or any kind of success at all as far as capping it would be a welcome relief . Then you can get down to a definitive range of liability . While it 's spilling , it 's very difficult to ascertain what the total costs will be , '' he said . Allen , who spoke minutes after markets had closed in New York , also said a third vessel at the leak site that will nearly double BP 's oil-capture capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from around 25,000 now was partially hooked up on Tuesday , but rough seas hampered efforts to finish the job . Estimates of the leak 's severity vary widely and run as high as a 100,000 barrels per day . BP is already committed to but not ultimately restricted to a $ 20 billion fund for clean-up and other costs stemming from the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . Its costs to date have topped $ 3 billion and are rising steeply . But the ultimate costs may well depend on how much crude is determined to have leaked from the well that blew when a rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . Investors are keenly eyeing containment efforts . Analysts said that barring other negative news , the stock may have found a floor with its New York closing price of $ 26.97 on June 25 . Shares are up 16 percent since the close on that day . `` All the negative news on the stock has had its impact , '' said Kurt Wulff , president at McDep LLC , an oil and gas research firm in Needham , Massachusetts . `` We 're optimistic that the news can get better from there . The talk about sovereign buyers may not lead to anything , but it certainly means that value-orientated investors are seeing opportunity . '' At one stage during the spill , BP had lost $ 100 billion in market value . The spill is wreaking havoc on coastal ecosystems , fishing communities and a tourist industry seen as especially important during a time of high unemployment . It has also thrust itself to the top of President Barack Obama 's crowded domestic agenda and presented a tough test for his leadership . A source in the United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday that BP executives held talks with sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar , as well as one in Singapore , to find a partner who might help it avoid being taken over . `` BP is seeking a strategic partner so it does n't get taken over by other major oil companies such as Exxon and Total , '' the source said . BP declined to comment on talk of a stake sale . It did say there were no plans to issue new equity to anyone , allaying some investors ' fears of a share issue to help pay for a spill expected to cost tens of billions of dollars . `` We 're always happy to welcome new shareholders or existing shareholders who wish to increase their holdings , but there 's no plans to issue new equity to anyone , '' a BP spokesman said . A top 10 shareholder said any move to issue shares would be viewed extremely negatively . `` It will be a kind of suicide note -- people will turn up with flamethrowers at management , '' the shareholder said . Several sovereign funds already hold BP stakes . Norway and Kuwait control about 1.8 percent each , China has 1.1 percent and Singapore 0.7 percent , according to Thomson Reuters data . Royal Bank of Scotland upgraded BP to `` buy '' from `` hold . '' `` Our base case scenario is significantly less pessimistic and in our view , the risk\\/reward profile of the shares is currently favorable , '' it said in a note . Just two out of 37 brokers have an `` underperform '' or `` sell '' rating on BP 's stock , and over two-thirds rate it `` buy '' or `` strong buy , '' according to Thomson Reuters data . The stock 's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio makes it easily the cheapest among the major oil companies . Britain 's The Times newspaper reported the British government was drafting contingency plans for a possible BP collapse . The British government declined to comment . Tests showed tar balls washed up on the Texas coast were from the spill , meaning every U.S. Gulf state -- Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida and now Texas -- has been soiled by the largest offshore oil spill in the country 's history . Texas asked BP for a $ 25 million block grant to help fund its cleanup . BP has provided similar funds to other states that have had crude wash ashore , and the credit rating agency Standard & Poor 's said that money was keeping the spill damage from affecting the credit ratings of affected states . There was a chance disturbed weather over the southern Gulf of Mexico could strengthen into a tropical storm this week , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said . Although it was not expected to travel over the site of the blown-out BP well , it could come closer than Hurricane Alex , which interrupted the cleanup operations last week .

The bubbling effect should increase fall by reducing the fluid density , as well as variable radial flow velocity which is higher in the center and lower around the containment case as a stationary surface . When we start injecting the junk shot we know what to expect and change the particles sizes and formats as the velocity of spill reduces by the this downward effect from the falling particles .

The offshore skimming devices -- seagoing vessels that suck up spilled crude -- are the first line of defense in the contingency plans that big oil companies are required to submit when they drill in the deep waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico . But the vast majority of skimming capacity listed in `` worst case scenario '' plans to combat major Gulf spills is already deployed to clean up BP 's leak , according to copies of the plans made public by Congress and lists of vessels active in the cleanup that were obtained by Reuters . With few skimmers in reserve , any new spill could be harder to fight , including one caused by a hurricane during the Atlantic storm season that forecasters say could be one of the most intense on record . That may give U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar the justification he needs to quickly issue a new deepwater drilling ban after a district court struck a first one down . `` We are working hard to issue a new moratorium in the coming days , '' Interior Department spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said , without offering further details . BP , Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell Oil Co , among the biggest operators in the Gulf , would rely largely on the same armada of skimmers , according to contingency plans that were released by lawmakers investigating the BP blow-out . Many of those vessels are among the 58 largest skimmers already cleaning up the biggest Gulf spill ever , one that has forced the closure of more than 80,000 square miles of fishing area and put the future of U.S. offshore drilling in doubt . For instance , 84 percent of the skimming capacity Shell lists in its Eastern Gulf `` worst case scenario '' spill contingency plan is engaged in the BP effort , according to an equipment manifest given to Reuters . Two big spill response firms told Reuters that over 90 percent of their resources are already at work on BP 's spill . The bulk of skimmers listed in oil companies ' contingency plans are controlled by a single spill response firm , Virginia-based Marine Spill Response Corp. -LRB- MSRC -RRB- , formed and funded collectively by big oil companies after Alaska 's Valdez spill in 1989 and run by a former BP executive . With BP 's blow-out still gushing up to 60,000 barrels per day , the Gulf clean-up effort may drag on for months or years , even if BP can plug its blown-out well in August as planned . Following the Valdez spill , offshore skimming vessels remained in action for more than a year . `` If you do n't have the equipment to respond to a spill , you ca n't be allowed to drill , '' said Dan Lawn , a former oil safety inspector for Alaska 's Department of Environmental Conservation . `` The contingency plans should be revoked because they are worthless right now . '' The U.S. Coast Guard , charged with overseeing offshore spill response , did not respond to requests for comment . U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman of New Orleans last month struck down the Obama administration 's first moratorium issued in May -- which halted drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet for six months . Feldman ruled it `` arbitrary and capricious . '' While any ban is controversial since U.S. Gulf oil projects account for a third of the country 's oil production and thousands of jobs , Salazar pledged to press ahead regardless . Grilled on Wednesday by a Congressman who said a ban would bring irreparable harm to Louisiana 's offshore industry , Salazar said : `` The greater irreparable harm would be if there was another blowout , when there is not the oil response capability to even deal with the current Horizon event . '' More than 7,000 U.S. Gulf-based spill response vessels -- including skimming units -- and around 50,000 people are involved in the Horizon cleanup , the largest and most complex spill response ever . The vessels have recovered more than 28 million gallons of oil-water mixture so far . The deployment of skimmers at BP 's spill has expanded more than fivefold since early June , and 550 skimmers were at work as of Friday , according to a release from spill responders . They expected 750 skimmers in action by August . In preparation for offshore disasters , scores of skimming vessels are usually kept at staging areas in the Gulf Coast , but few are idle now . BP 's Gulf contingency plans call for racing skimmers to a Gulf spill in as little as 6.5 hours . A contingency plan for Shell , the No. 2 Gulf producer , shows it could race 24 skimmers with capacity to suck up 162,752 of oil per day to a potential blow-out . At least 16 of the skimmers , and all of the largest ones , are engaged . Those that may still be available could collect less than 25,818 barrels , the vessel lists showed . Shell declined comment on its Gulf contingency plans . A person close to the company said Shell 's contingency plan for the Gulf envisages an unlikely scenario with multiple spills . There is a `` considerable amount '' of safety equipment available still available , the person said , and Shell would still rely on a Gulf-based fleet of skimmers . In addition , Shell could quickly import more boom , dispersant and other safety gear from Europe , the person said . To be sure , skimmers are no silver bullet . They often collect less than 20 percent of oil that reaches the sea surface , experts say . But used with barges , tugs , absorbent booms and dispersants , skimmers play a major part in keeping oil from fouling beaches , especially if they are deployed fast . Some support is already arriving from abroad . One Taiwanese vessel that arrived this week , the so-called A Whale , is a converted supertanker with capacity to process up to 500,000 barrels per day of oil and water mix . It may gain Coast Guard approval to operate this weekend . But the bulk of the world 's offshore skimmers are on standby for spill responses elsewhere . Only 15 foreign response vessels were at work on the Gulf spill last week . And even the A Whale is unlikely to free up other U.S. skimmers from their ongoing work , since an aggressive spill response requires up to hundreds of agile skimmers to cover the rapidly-expanding area of oil slicks , experts say . BP 's spill is no longer a single slick but a `` massive collection of smaller patches of oil , '' response commanders wrote on Friday . Hurricanes bring more risk for oil companies in the Gulf , often requiring the deployment of skimmers after they pass . In 2005 , Katrina ravaged the region , laying waste to several drilling platforms and causing spills of at least 6.5 million gallons , more than half of the Valdez spill volume . After the Valdez disaster , MSRC deployed seven of its largest , ` responder-class ' skimmers during the 2005 storm season . Today , 12 of the firm 's 15 responder-class vessels are dedicated to BP 's spill , MSRC spokeswoman Judith Roos said . The firm also operates dozens of smaller skimmers . `` Should another event occur , the Coast Guard has the authority to determine where to direct our resources , '' Roos said . Shell , BP and Exxon Mobil 's contingency plans all call for relying heavily on MSRC skimmers . Employees at National Response Corp. and Ampol , the two other response firms listed in all three companies ' Gulf response plans , told Reuters they have deployed more than 90 percent of the equipment they had available in the Gulf . -LRB- Reporting by Joshua Schneyer ; editing by Alden Bentley and David Gregorio -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

ABU DHABI\\/HOUSTON | Wed Jul 7 , 2010 6:51 pm EDT ABU DHABI\\/HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP boss Tony Hayward met with an Abu Dhabi state investment fund on Wednesday , part of a quest for cash to ward off takeovers and help pay for the worst oil spill in U.S. history . The action on Thursday was set to move back to the courts with the oil drilling industry going head-to-head with the Obama administration over the White House effort to suspend deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for six months in the wake of the catastrophic well blowout . -LRB- nN07171381 -RRB- Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was seen by Reuters with a senior official from another Abu Dhabi fund , and a report said Saudi investors were looking to buy 10 percent to 15 percent of the British oil company . A United Arab Emirates official said Hayward 's visit with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority -LRB- ADIA -RRB- was a routine one . An ADIA spokesman declined comment . `` We are here to talk to our existing shareholders , '' a cheerful-looking Hayward told Reuters in the ornate , marble lobby of an Abu Dhabi office building before heading into a meeting , along with his six-man entourage . But bankers say BP is on a marketing drive for its stock , whose price has fallen by half since its well blew out in April , spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and soiling the shores of every U.S. Gulf Coast state . Hayward was in Azerbaijan on Tuesday . BP 's shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed up almost 4 percent , buoyed by investor relief the company had said it does not plan to issue new equity , and speculation the worst is behind for what they see as an underpriced energy giant . `` With the CEO in Abu Dhabi speaking to the sovereign wealth fund to get some investment , it 's not surprising that there is some enthusiasm in the market for BP shares , '' said Mic Mills , head of electronic trading at London-based ETX Capital . Progress on the relief well , seen as the best hope for finally stopping the 79-day-old disaster , also lifted investor hearts . The U.S. official overseeing the spill cleanup said it was 15 feet from the side of the leaking well , although still not expected to be finished before mid-August . The spill is wreaking havoc on coastal ecosystems , killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins and risking multibillion-dollar fishing and tourist industries at a time of high unemployment . As a result , it sits atop U.S. President Barack Obama 's crowded domestic agenda and has sternly tested his leadership . On Thursday , the next big round will play out in court in the fight between the drilling industry and the White House over its efforts to suspend offshore drilling . Given the business and environmental stakes , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans is expected to rule quickly , after a rare one-hour oral argument , on whether deepwater drilling should be temporarily halted again . A federal judge , also in New Orleans , lifted the moratorium last month after Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc argued it was arbitrary because it was a blanket ban on all new drilling in depths below 500 feet . The Obama administration appealed the decision , defending the suspension as needed to provide time to probe the BP oil spill 's cause and ensure other drilling rigs operate safely . The administration is seeking a stay of the judge 's ruling at the hearing , slated for 3 p.m. local time -LRB- 2000 GMT -RRB- on Thursday . The industry calls it an unnecessary infringement on its business that costs jobs . The U.S. Energy Information Administration said the ban will reduce crude output an average of 82,000 barrels per day , more than previously estimated . BP 's Alaska unit said on Wednesday it will probably delay until 2011 development drilling at its offshore Liberty field . It had been due to start late this year . A successful court challenge `` could give some of these -LRB- drillers ' -RRB- stocks a lift in the near term , '' said Channing Smith , co-portfolio manager of Tulsa , Oklahoma-based Capital Advisors Growth Fund . The Philadelphia oil services sector index is down about 25 percent from its 2010 high hit in late April . The European Union 's energy chief said in Brussels that the bloc should consider its own moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling until after a probe into the BP spill . Estimates of the leak 's severity vary widely , to as high as 100,000 barrels per day . A new collection vessel that should more than double BP 's oil-capture capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from around 25,000 is projected to take three more days to hook up , as rough seas hamper efforts to finish the job . With the region settling into the six-month hurricane season , forecasters were watching a weather system over the southern Gulf that could develop into a tropical depression and hit the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Thursday . Pushed by the Obama administration , BP has committed to a $ 20 billion fund for clean-up and other costs stemming from the spill . Its costs to date have topped $ 3 billion . The final bill may depend on how much crude pours from the well , which blew when a rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . So containment efforts are keenly watched . BP executives have held talks with sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait , Qatar and Singapore , seeking a partner that might help it avoid being taken over , a UAE source said . Abu Dhabi 's International Petroleum Investment Company , was not interested in buying a BP stake , a company source said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The first target is to concentrate power to close that oil hole far 1500 meters from surface ships . What is happening seems a slow rallenty of eleven september2001 tragedy . I 'm crying every hour with my child -LRB- five years -RRB- for what is happening in Louisiana . I tried to communicate in every manner my technical ideas to somebody who wants really stop the leak . i tried to send emails with drawings of plug with steel plate crown around TO horizon support ... coast guard ... @uscg . mil ; and horizon support , The first reason of this accident should be bad maintainance of systems and eccessive pressures than preventived , then no gas tight and electrical problems ... . it is not thje first time . But I am quite sure that the real criminal act of BP is their intention to continue to collect oil instead to stop it definitely and then drill again . ... But as now we can program the positive act to close the leak completely : It is easy to be closed when the bottom area around this hole is free from interference objects : solution is to clean the area with the power of us coast guards and us navy . The removal of all piping interferences and strange inventions to have an horizontal and clean area around the hole . The column of water above this hole is 150 atm of pressure and can be used on a crown steel horizontal plate welded around a below positioned plug . The pressure of water is on a steel larger area pushing on the bottom around the hole and the pressure from gas\\/oil is on the plug only . Like a cap `` sombrero '' . This is enough to close this hole . Whithout losses of money and energies of great men who are fighting against effects of the oil invasion . Please understand this simple concept which is not be taken in consideration enough . I am still confused if the pressure of oil coming out from the hole is more than 100 psi and the blow up was due to the pressure how then drilling a relief hole can be safeguarded so that we do not have another problem like the earlier one .

I spoke with Nassim and asked him to expound upon his tweet . Here is what Nassim wrote me : Because security analysts and investment `` experts '' do n't understand robustness and redundancy , managers have an incentive to hide risks of blowups , Black Swan exposures , by cutting corners they get better numbers and appear cosmetically to be profitable while sitting on dynamite . This is not too different from banks stashing their portfolios with more and more hidden risks . So this condition of increased fragility over time comes from the incentive system and the bogus risk measures and empirically invalid business school techniques used by analysts . A manager collects annual bonuses , and does not pay back his past compensation in the event of a blowup . There is a mismatch between the bonus frequency and the time to eventual blowup . The tragedy is that , in this case , as with banks , there are externalities and shareholders are not the ones footing the bill , but society at large . More can be found about the 10 rules for a black swan robust society in Nassim 's second edition of The Black Swan . And by an extended logic : `` rats work harder when the rewards are unpredictable -LRB- B.F. Skinner , Psychologist -RRB- '' . No wonder the risk-hiding tendency is matched by legendary hours spent at work that some industries have become famous for ! So , a limitless incentive linked to irrelevant metric - -RRB- more risk cover ups - -RRB- longer hours worked . Everybody is happy until the unthinkable happens !

This things also happen due to the wrong understanding of what is `` optimization '' . Sometimes , to cut costs means to increase them at some areas in the company and reduce in others . The whole optimization does not means to optimize all parts of the system . Nic is right on again , the alignment of incentives and outcomes is skewed towards risk for others and rewards for uninvolved .

Would it be called bullying if a man got irate because someone threw a bunch of junk in their back garden ? There 's a difference between spilling the rubbish bin in your own back garden and doing the same in the neighbor 's garden . The author clearly supports big business despite the extreme damage done . This is not something that BP can simply apologize for and expect to move on . This is an ecological disaster that could and probably will have an effect on generations to come . IMO BP has not suffered nearly the damage that it has caused . Although there are efforts , BP has not returned things to the way they were before its negligence caused this tragedy . Until they do , I say let the bullying go on ! BP -- BIG PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENT I think that we are being too hard on BP . yes they made some bad decisions along the way but most of the actual drill work was subcontracted and all done to current law and standard practice . It could have happened to any company and if we do n't change current requirements and improve technology it will given time ! Ease up everyone ... I live along the Gulf Coast and I will forgive . From an external , non-US , perspective America gives the impression that it no longer understands how business works and how it can be regulated ; all the way from the banks to the energy industry . As evidenced by the banks , and now the oil industry , this leaves an open gap for those wishing to make profits or cut risky cost corners for their own or their corporate benefit to step through . This lack of integration and understanding in government -LRB- eg drilling moratorium , Browner 's unlimited liability proposals etc. -RRB- leaves the US open to powerful non-democratic lobbies , like the Environmental Lobby , who have successfully campaigned against nuclear power , coal and now have the opportunity to shut-dwon the oil industry . WIth a lack of leadership in government there is only one way this can go . Unfortunately , the environmental zealots do not understand the unintended consequences risks , as they probably do n't with Climate Change hypotheses , of losing industrial capacity , jobs and wealth . Luckily , in a decade or so , we wo n't have to listen to America 's hegemonistic arrogance as we will have China and India with enough power to ensure that the new wealthy countries ' views are heard to the detriment of the US . In this sense BP , as an individual entity , is not being targeted but the whole of the fossil fuel society is a target . I wonder if , in 10 years or so , the US will be rich enough to buy all those wind turbines and solar panels from China and India that they will need for their Green Revolution ? Very good points here . Being involved in social media and passionate about Sustainability this is always a difficult question . Is the activism on the street more effective then online , or what do you do best to make your voice heard . I believe that we as stakeholders need to practice all of the possibilities we have at our disposal to make our voices and opinion heard . In the the case of BP this is even more so the case because of the scale of the disaster . We need to use all channels we have to oppose corporate malpractice . Right now I am using the blogosphere but next week I am doing something different to make my voice heard . That is what I call sustained stakeholder activism . Surely this piece is a joke . Definition of bully : To force one 's way aggressively or by intimidation . If only we \\* could \\* bully BP ! Clearly no one can make them do much . But that 's what happens when you go far too far in deregulating industry . Speaking of ... `` yes they made some bad decisions along the way but most of the actual drill work was subcontracted and all done to current law and standard practice . It could have happened to any company and if we don t change current requirements and improve technology it will given time ! '' But it 's BP and their oily brethren that routinely pay high-powered lobbyists big bucks to lobby in DC to lessen restrictions in every way possible . Too many of people have bought into the ridiculous concept that deregulation is the key to a bright and glittering economic future . And the average lawmaker who 's being offered huge campaign contributions from industry will happily hop aboard the corporate gravy train unless there 's a loud enough outcry from mainstream voters to make it too dangerous to their re-election bids . In short , BP and the rest of the industry has worked very hard for years to dictate `` current law and practice . '' Deregulation does n't happen by accident . And deregulation does n't favor business . It favors crooked business . But it can also create such an uneven playing field that it can put out of business those honest players that actually try to deal fairly with their employees and their customers and essentially try to be good corporate citizens . Are you serious , Reuters ? This to me is a piece that 's written just to be controversial because that draws attention . It 's simply offensive . Next time , try asking a real question like , `` Are Americans Being Bullied By Corporations ? '' No , not even close as much as they should ! As a non-US and non-UK citizen I observe this whole BP mess right from the very beginning and am shocked about BPs incompetence , ignorance and ruthlessness . But there are still some positive aspects in it too . 1 -RRB- Americans are starting to wake up and become more interested in alternative energies 2 -RRB- The catastrophic oil spills in other regions of the world are on the reporters lists too 3 -RRB- Germany will become the first G20 country run 100 % by renewable\\/alternative energies by 2050 , 18 % by now , to say `` bye bye '' to big oil , coal , natural gas and nuclear power .

Researchers identified new species of pancake batfishes , a flat fish rarely seen because of the dark depths they favor . They are named for the clumsy way they `` walk '' along the sea bottom , like a bat crawling . `` One of the fishes that we describe is completely restricted to the oil spill area , '' John Sparks of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , said in a statement released on Thursday . `` If we are still finding new species of fishes in the Gulf , imagine how much diversity , especially microdiversity , is out there that we do not know about . '' Writing in the Journal of Fish Biology , Sparks and his colleagues named the species as Halieutichthys intermedius and H. bispinosus . A third already known species called H. aculeatus also only lives in waters affected by the spill , they said . Pancake batfishes have round , flat bodies with giant heads and mouths they can thrust forward . They use arm-like fins to drag themselves along the bottom and a modified dorsal fin excretes fluid to lure prey . Sparks said the three species had been considered just one species , but his team found distinct differences . `` These discoveries underscore the potential loss of undocumented biodiversity that a disaster of this scale may portend , '' he said .

BP stuck to its August target to complete a relief well to halt the worst oil spill in U.S. history , after a press report raised hopes the company could stem the 80-day-old leak sooner . The head of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration unit , Bob Dudley , told the Wall Street Journal that it could be possible to stop the well between July 20 and July 27 `` in a perfect world with no interruptions '' . `` He -LRB- Dudley -RRB- gave that as the very , very best scenario if everything went absolutely superbly according to plan and there are no interruptions but the expectation is that it will be August , '' a spokeswoman said . Bankers say BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward is currently on an international marketing drive for its stock , whose price has fallen by around half since the Macondo subsea well blew out in April , spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and soiling the shores of every U.S. Gulf Coast state . The shares were up 0.8 percent at 365 pence by 1020 GMT on Thursday , when the Stoxx 600 European oil and gas sector index was up 0.85 pct . Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings on Thursday dismissed talk it had held discussions with BP for a strategic stake . `` It 's speculation , '' Temasek Executive Director Simon Israel told reporters when asked if Temasek was talking to BP . Temasek 's comment comes after Hayward met an Abu Dhabi state investment fund on Wednesday . Also on Thursday , the oil drilling industry was set to confront the Obama administration in court over the White House 's effort to suspend deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for six months . A federal judge , also in New Orleans , lifted the moratorium last month after Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc argued it was arbitrary because it was a blanket ban on all new drilling in depths below 500 feet -LRB- 152.5 metres -RRB- . The Obama administration appealed , saying the suspension was needed to give time to investigate the cause of the BP blowout and ensure other drilling rigs operate safely . It is seeking a stay of the judge 's ruling at the hearing , sscheduled for 3 p.m. local time -LRB- 2000 GMT -RRB- on Thursday . The U.S. Energy Information Administration said the ban would reduce crude output by an average of 82,000 barrels a day , more than previously estimated . A successful court challenge `` could give some of these -LRB- drillers ' -RRB- stocks a lift in the near term , '' said Channing Smith , co-portfolio manager of Tulsa , Oklahoma-based Capital Advisors Growth Fund . The European Union 's energy chief said on Wednesday the bloc should consider its own moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling until after a probe into the BP spill . Meanwhile the oil from the Macondo well is wreaking havoc on coastal ecosystems , killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins and risking multibillion-dollar fishing and tourist industries at a time of high unemployment . Estimates of the leak 's severity vary widely , to as high as 100,000 barrels per day . A new collection vessel that should more than double BP 's oil-capture capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from around 25,000 is projected to take three more days to hook up , as rough seas hamper efforts to finish the job . With the region now a month into the six-month hurricane season , U.S. forecasters reported late on Wednesday that a tropical depression had formed over the southern Gulf and was set to slam into the Gulf Coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Thursday . Another serious storm in the Gulf of Mexico could further disrupt efforts to contain the massive oil spill . The region is still recovering from Hurricane Alex , the first named cyclone of the season , which battered northern Mexico last week , dumping heavy rains and flooding the Mexican city of Monterrey , killing 12 people . Alex , a Category 2 storm when it hit , shuttered some oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico as a precaution and delayed efforts to capture oil gushing from the damaged well . Pushed by the Obama administration , BP has committed to a $ 20 billion fund for clean-up and other costs stemming from the spill . Its costs to date have topped $ 3 billion .

That spill from a ship killed more than 60,000 long-tailed ducks wintering in the area after they fatally mistook the slick for an attractive patch of calm water , according to Arne Jernelov , of the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm , writing in today 's edition of the journal Nature . By contrast , he writes that fewer than 1,200 birds have so far been recorded killed after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which has led to a leak of a gigantic 250,000 to 400,000 tonnes of oil in the Gulf of Mexico . About 60,000 birds were killed off Alaska in 1989 by the accident usually known as the Exxon Valdez spill -LRB- ... Exxon 's website calls it The Valdez Oil Spill -RRB- , previously the biggest spill off the United States at 37,000 tonnes . By my maths , the Baltic Sea spill killed one bird for about every 80 grams of oil -LRB- ... an amount easily spilt when filling up a car -RRB- , the BP spill -LRB- so far -RRB- one per 200-330 tonnes . Even tiny amounts of oil can mean that birds ' feathers stick together and let chill water , like in the Baltic Sea , get to their bodies through what is normally a layer of insulation . They can then die of cold . `` There is no clear relationship between the amount of oil in the marine environment and the likely impact on wildlife . A smaller spill at the wrong time\\/wrong season and in a sensitive environment may prove much more harmful than a larger spill at another time of the year in another or even the same environment . Even small spills can have very large effects , '' it says . `` In a cold climate an oil spot the size of 2-3 square centimetres can be enough to kill a bird , '' it says . It also says that penguins give another example of a how small spills can cause big problems for birds . A collision of two oil tankers off South Africa in 1977 released 31,000 tonnes of oil and polluted just 47 African penguins , it says . But a far smaller spill of 1,000 tonnes of oil after the sinking of the Treasure in 2000 oiled 20,000 penguins and another 20,000 were removed from their breeding colonies on Dassen and Robben islands to avoid getting them soiled .

N -RRB- was set on Friday to install a bigger cap that could contain almost all the oil leaking from its blown-out Gulf of Mexico well , a top U.S. official said . The Obama administration has been pressing the British energy giant to install the new cap , which could capture up to 80,000 barrels -LRB- 3,360,000 gallons\\/12 ,700,00 litres -RRB- of oil a day , versus the 25,000 barrels currently being contained . The U.S. government has estimated the well is leaking a maximum of 60,000 barrels a day , although independent estimates have been as high as 100,000 barrels a day . Retired retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who is overseeing the response to the spill , told a news conference that the well could be contained -- but not plugged -- by Sunday or Monday , when the cap was installed on top of it . `` When we have the cap on , and it 's sealed and we know that we 've got a seal , yes '' -LRB- it will be contained -RRB- , Allen said . BP has been under enormous pressure to halt the oil , which has polluted coastlines on all five U.S. Gulf states , threatened multi-billion dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . It is the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . The company 's costs for the spill likely will be tied to the amount of oil that ultimately flows out of the well . He said later BP had responded to a government request to lay out a timeline for installing the new cap . `` We 're reviewing it right now , '' Allen told Reuters . `` If there are no problems with it , we 'll probably authorize them to move ahead later on this evening . '' `` It looks like it 's achievable at this point if we remain on schedule , '' Allen said . `` If we approve the timeline , we would start tomorrow to remove the current cap and to start the sequence of events . '' The spill has complicated the U.S. relationship with Britain , while subjecting Obama to fierce criticism that his handling of the disaster has been too slow . The administration reiterated on Friday that it would announce a new deepwater oil drilling moratorium , a pledge that came after a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate a six-month ban on drilling below 500 feet -LRB- 152.5 metres -RRB- . `` In the next several days we 'll be making an announcement about keeping the moratorium in place , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said during a visit to California . `` It will be a new moratorium , '' he said . The government imposed the ban in response to the BP spill , but a federal judge last month blocked the move . In refusing to stay that decision on Thursday , the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the government failed to show how it would be irreparably harmed if it were not granted . The administration said it did not consider the ruling a major setback because the Interior Department had the power to apply to stop any deepwater drilling project in the Gulf . `` Our view on the moratorium is that it was right when it was issued and it 's right today , '' Salazar said . Companies and other critics of the administration 's ban have warned that it is too broad and could push oil drillers to abandon U.S. waters , spurring job losses at a time of economic hardship , particularly in Gulf states . U.S.-based Diamond Offshore Drilling -LRB- DO . N -RRB- said on Friday it was moving its Ocean Endeavor rig to Egypt from the Gulf of Mexico , becoming the first U.S. company to do so because of uncertainty surrounding the ban .

VX -RRB- , the owner of the rig that exploded on April 20 , triggering the spill , up more than 5 percent on the Zurich stock exchange on Friday . They had lost almost half their value since April . BP , which has seen its share price plummet by about half during the crisis , closed fractionally higher , after rallying to gain about 25 percent from a low over the past two weeks . Investors have been cheered by reports that BP is seeking new investors and speculation that the worst of the spill might be over . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . This is `` Day 81 ? of the BP oil spill . Coastal communities have been , and continue to be , devastated . The Obama administration should do more than merely continue to blame BP for its lack of preparation and response efforts . Pursuant to OPA Section 4201 , and given that the BP oil spill is a discharge posing substantial threat to public health or welfare , President Obama should have federalized the collection of the oil that is in the sea and the restoration of the coastal areas impacted by the oil . Both of these activities could be done without having to federalize the operational priority of stopping the flow of oil from the well . This lack of leadership on the part of the Obama administration is unacceptable . The blowout of April 20 , 2010 aboard the Deepwater Horizon was clearly preventable . The fact that the BP oil spill has been allowed to reach coastal areas is inexcusable . For a clear understanding of the issues involved , visit : I feel like riding a bike past the White House and shouting `` Ha Ha ! '' Obama is killing thousands of jobs instead of enforcing the regulations which would have prevented this if they had been enforced . Instead Obama wants to stop drilling in a place were we can regulate , and switch production to Africa and South America were we cant . Then transport that oil in ships here .

It will take up to a week for robots working 1 mile underwater to completely fit a new cap and seal . Oil will flow mostly unchecked until the bigger containment system is installed , further hurting tourism and fishing in all five states along the Gulf Coast . The British energy giant , which is also drilling two relief wells to try to permanently plug the leak , hopes the new containment system will funnel as much as 80,000 barrels -LRB- 12.7 million liters -RRB- per day of oil to vessels on the surface -- more than three times the current amount . It expects the first of the relief wells to intercept Macondo by the end of July , a first step in plugging the well by early to mid-August . BP is also on track to start a rig on Sunday evening that can siphon up to 25,000 bpd from the well , Wells said . The Obama administration has pressed BP to take advantage of calm weather and move forward with the containment . Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod , asked on the `` Fox News Sunday '' program about hopes the spill will be contained by the end of July , said he was `` reasonably confident but obviously this thing is uncharted waters . '' BP , which has set up a $ 20 billion spill fund under pressure from the White House , removed a smaller containment cap from the gushing well on Saturday . On Day 83 of the disaster , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department has started interviewing witnesses as part of a criminal and civil investigation into the worst oil spill in U.S. history . BP shares have been hammered by the disaster and are likely to remain volatile until the well is capped and the company 's total costs and liabilities are clear . Some analysts have put BP 's likely costs at $ 20 billion to $ 40 billion but estimates have gone as high as $ 100 billion . Speculation is running high that BP is approaching several sovereign wealth funds for cash to ward off a takeover and to help pay for the spill . BP boss Tony Hayward met with an Abu Dhabi state investment fund last week . In Britain , The Sunday Times newspaper said BP is in talks to sell up to $ 12 billion in assets , including a stake in Alaska , to Apache Corp. . Holder said the U.S. investigation could apply to other companies involved in the drilling of the damaged well . `` We are in the process of accumulating documents , talking to witnesses on both the criminal side as well as the civil side , '' he told the CBS program `` Face the Nation . '' The investigation is aimed at ensuring no tax dollars pay for the cleanup `` and to make sure that we hold accountable anybody who was responsible for the spill , '' Holder said . If the Justice Department finds violations , penalties could be in the many billions of dollars . People living at the heart of the crisis expressed frustration over the pace of the cleanup . For Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana , the top priority is more boats to mop up oil . `` Number one is a sense of urgency , '' he said . `` To get out on the water to work 24\\/7 . We have to be on the front lines . '' Nungesser said he was due to meet two Obama administration officials on Sunday , a day before its first commission hearings on the spill in New Orleans . The administration 's commission consists of seven engineers , environmentalists and former politicians who plan to investigate decisions by oil companies and government regulators that may have led to the disaster . The panel will hear testimony from government officials , businesses groups like the Louisiana Shrimp Association , and BP 's Wells through Tuesday . As the spill hit local economies , animal welfare groups are distributing donated dog food to Plaquemines Parish fishermen and others to help struggling owners keep their pets . Donna Schexnayder of the Plaquemines Animal Welfare Society said she has noticed more pets being given to the shelter and expects the number to grow . `` We 're starting to see it a little more , '' she said . `` Within the next month or so , it will hit . '' Cherie Pete teared up as she described the changes confronting fisherman who are now mopping up oil . `` Now they have the hard hats on , and the tags around their necks , '' Pete said . `` They do n't look like our men . Our total way of life has already changed . '' Her home was completely submerged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .

A U.N. Environment Programme report on Tuesday urged businesses to take more account of their impact on the natural resources which people depend on . It said the private sector would act faster if governments more explicitly valued such resources , including biodiversity , a term for the wide array of animal and plant species . `` The oil spill goes to the heart of a contradictory set of signals , '' said Achim Steiner , UNEP executive director . He said the money spent on cleaning up the spill from BP Plc 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico would be included in Gross Domestic Product , the conventional measure of economic activity , but many costs to nature including the health of fisheries and the survival of marine creatures would not . `` An oil spill could turn out to be a positive thing for the GDP indicator , while it has actually caused a far greater -LRB- negative -RRB- impact in terms of the natural wealth and natural capital of the United States , '' said Steiner . `` We 're trying to tackle the issue of invisibility of the value of biodiversity in the marketplace . '' Tuesday 's report argued that extractive industries such as oil and mining , as well as wider industry , risked losing customers , brand value , efficiencies and opportunities if they failed to take account of biodiversity , as attention to its value rose . One example of explicit valuation was the payment by some cities for conservation of forests and wetlands , in order to use these to cleanse their water supplies and effluent and so avoid more expensive , artificial treatment . Tuesday 's report calculated the value of such emerging markets for water services at $ 5 billion in 2008 . The report is the latest such initiative in 2010 , which the United Nations has declared ` International Year of Biodiversity ' .

But the future is grim , he told a presidential panel on Monday , due to the devastating BP Plc spill that has been gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico since late April . `` Due to this unnatural catastrophe in our water , P&J may forever be extinct , '' he said . Sunseri , who has already laid off 11 workers , was among a group of speakers from the fishing , seafood and tourism industries sharing stories of loss with the seven-member commission investigating the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Keith Overton , chairman of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association , said tourism operators across his state were already suffering even though tar balls had been found only on the Florida Panhandle in the north . At his company , TradeWinds Island Resorts near St Petersburg , calls from potential customers are down 25 percent , he said . `` These losses have occurred in our area without a single drop of oil reaching our shore , '' said Overton . He implored the panel not to overlook legitimate claims from businesses hit by a public misperception that all Gulf Coast areas should be avoided . `` I think our losses are going to be scrutinized . Give us the benefit of the doubt , '' Overton said . President Barack Obama set up the commission with an executive order in late May , a month after a rig drilling a well for BP , the Deepwater Horizon owned by Transocean Ltd , sank after an explosion . Eleven workers were killed and the damaged well has been spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico from a mile under the surface . BP is using a containment system to capture some of the oil and hopes to finally plug the leak by mid-August . Michael Hecht of Greater New Orleans Inc , an economic development agency , warned the panel not to underestimate the damage of a moratorium on deepwater drilling sought by the Obama administration . `` The economic impact from the oil spill itself , however broad and long-lasting , will likely be dwarfed by the impact of the moratorium , '' Hecht said . A drilling freeze threatens 24,000 jobs in Louisiana alone , representing nearly $ 2 billion in wages , he said . Cherri Foytlin , who spoke during a public comment period , said the $ 1,600 she and her husband , an out-of-work offshore oil worker , brought in last month to support their six children barely covered their $ 1000 mortgage . `` Whatever you do , please take into account that you are talking about people , '' Foytlin said . `` You are not talking about numbers , you are not talking about politics . You are talking about my family . My whole Louisiana family . '' One speaker said the disaster affects not just the fishing industry , but lucrative sport fishing as well . That pastime supports a wide variety of small business , from bait and tackle shops to marinas , charter vessels , hotels , and gas stations , said Jeff Angers , president of the Center for Coastal Conservation , a group that advocates sport fishing . `` If the entire Gulf were closed to recreational fishing from May to August , the region would lose ... $ 1.1 billion and about 19,000 jobs , '' Angers told the panel . The spill has wreaked havoc on delicate coastal ecosystems , killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins and threatening the spawning season of fish . Containment and cleanup have taken too long , said Sunseri of P&J Oyster , expressing a common complaint in the area . `` Our livelihoods have been drastically jeopardized , '' he said . `` I do n't see a future in the oyster business as it once was .

Natural seeps from thousands of spots from the Pacific Ocean to the North Sea account for about 45 percent of all oil entering the oceans in a typical year , according to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences . The rest is from leaks caused by people . The little-understood seeps show that the oceans can absorb what is normally viewed as harmful pollution -- a host of microbes can eat oil and gas , especially light compounds such as gasoline , while finding thicker tars indigestible . `` You can sometimes see oil from seeps as slicks on the surface , '' said Arne Jernelov of the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm , who led a U.N. environmental study of a huge blowout on the Mexican Ixtoc 1 rig in 1979 . `` But a large concentrated spill is a totally different thing ... Nature can not adapt , '' he said of BP 's 85-day spill . Apart from being eaten by bacteria , oil can evaporate and is broken down by sunlight . Environmentalists say that the existence of seeps should not be a backdoor justification for dumping oil in the seas that can kill creatures from turtles to pelicans . `` While these seeps can release large amounts of oil , the rate is usually very slow , which allows the surrounding ecosystems to adapt , '' environmental group Oceana said in a report . Other species are unable to adapt and die . Jernelov estimates BP 's leak , the worst in U.S. history , at 250,000 to 400,000 tonnes by early this month , compared with 140,000 tonnes leaking naturally every year from seeps in the seabed in the Gulf of Mexico alone . On land , one of the biggest natural oil ponds is Trinidad 's Pitch Lake -- English mariner Walter Raleigh used its pitch to caulk his ship in 1595 . On the seabed , seeps are often hard to locate , are intermittent and seem to seal themselves . Some oil companies use the presence of seeps as a guide to exploration . Oil from each deposit has a distinct chemical makeup . `` We 've seen about 1 percent of the sea floor . When you start finding oil floating around you think it 's from a tanker . But a significant amount comes from below , '' said Martin Hovland , an expert on seeps at the University of Bergen in Norway . He said late Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl was probably wrong to blame human pollution for oil spotted in mid-Atlantic from his Ra raft in 1969 and 1970 . The oil , some encrusted with barnacles and algae , may well have been from a natural seep . And Hovland said seeps might be far more important in the food chain than believed , perhaps drawing humpback whales to the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California where thick mats of bacteria and other organisms carpet the seabed near seeps . Seeps might also explain why the North Sea , rich in oil and gas , has more fish than the nearby Irish Sea , he said . The latest U.S. National Academy of Sciences estimates , in a 2003 study , say seeps account for 600,000 tonnes of oil out of a total 1.3 million tonnes entering the oceans yearly . Leaks from human production , transport and consumption account for about 700,000 tonnes a year .

The British energy giant 's U.S. shares initially jumped 10 percent on the news and posted strong gains for the day . The Coast Guard said BP likely will release the flow of oil again after the test is done -- siphoning it to ships on the ocean surface in an improved system able to handle up to 80,000 barrels a day until a relief well seals the well permanently .

The news that BP had finally stopped the leak -- at least during the test -- was a bit of good news for the British company , which has seen its share value plummet and reputation battered since the April rig explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the spill of millions of gallons of oil .

Beyond directly sea-related sectors such as fishing and offshore energy production , the gushing oil leak is fouling other drivers of the economy like lodging , casinos , real estate and governments as the overall U.S. economy emerges from the worst recession since the 1930s . As BP 's heavy spending to stop the leak , company compensation payouts and its $ 20 billion escrow fund blunts some immediate financial damage , policy makers , executives , business owners and economists are beginning to gauge the disaster 's long-term consequences . The spill and its consequences , such as the federal government 's deepwater-drilling moratorium , threatens coastal property values , thousands of energy sector jobs and tourism businesses reliant on pristine beaches and sparkling waters . `` Right now tax revenues are a secondary issue to the economic growth over the long term , '' said economist Mark McMullen of Moody 's economy.com . `` What 's scary is : when will it bounce back ? And what will be the lasting damage to the economy and government coffers ? '' Looking at those questions , Mississippi 's governor last week ordered economists , state tax officials , business leaders and marine experts to put aside current finance pressures and spend a year studying the ramifications of the April 20 catastrophe . `` We need a clear grasp on how this oil spill will impact the State of Mississippi and local communities for years to come , '' Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said . Even before the disaster , in the first three months of 2010 , the revenue of states in the Gulf region shrank , according to a report this week from the Rockefeller Institute of Government . While all 50 state governments across America had an overall 2.5 percent rise in revenues , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida and Texas all showed declines in year-over-year comparisons . A scramble for revenue will remain feverish for the foreseeable future . The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities last month forecast states face revenue shortfalls of $ 140 billion in the coming fiscal year . The projected fiscal 2011 budget gaps for Gulf states total at least $ 11 billion , including ones for Florida of $ 4.7 billion , Texas of $ 4.6 billion , and Louisiana at $ 1 billion , according to the center . Beyond hiking taxes , lifting fees and cutting spending , some governments look to tax medical marijuana and sugared drinks . Others such as Florida are clearing the way for more gambling or casinos , at least in part to raise revenue . In Louisiana , the Gulf state most reliant on energy businesses , the economic costs of the federal moratorium on deepwater oil drilling , in place through November 30 , will be severe and long lasting , according to Eric Smith , associate director of Tulane University 's Energy Institute . Smith estimated the moratorium affects dozens of deepwater rigs that ordinarily employ as many as 10,000 crew making about $ 100,000 each annually , with most of those wages spent in Louisiana and nearby states . The ripples from the moratorium may take the number of lost jobs in Louisiana to 24,000 , according to Michael Hecht , head of Greater New Orleans Inc , an economic development agency . `` The economic impact from the oil spill itself , however broad and long-lasting , will likely be dwarfed by the impact from the moratorium , '' Hecht this week told a presidential panel investigating the disaster . Many of the rigs , their high-paying jobs and supply requirements will move elsewhere , Smith said , and slow the region 's economy for years . One big driller , Diamond Offshore Drilling , has already announced it is moving two of its five rigs in the Gulf to other regions . The likelihood of tougher U.S. regulations after the BP disaster for Gulf offshore drilling may drive operators to send rigs to Brazil and other regions , Standard & Poor 's said . `` This is a case of the regulators not understanding the business they are regulating , '' Smith said . `` They do n't understand the contracts . These things cost $ 500 million to $ 600 million to build . They have to operate . '' In west Florida 's Panhandle , an area with many tourist businesses , officials in Escambia County worry that property prices already hit by the prolonged U.S. housing market slump will fall further . The county 's property last year was appraised a total 6 percent less than a year earlier at $ 27.6 billion . That meant lower property tax revenue and a $ 24-million reduction in county spending . Florida 's tourist-dependent coastal economies stand to lose as much as 39,000 jobs and $ 2.2 billion or more in business because of the BP oil spill , according to University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith . `` The idea that a great environmental disaster could become a great economic one is n't inconceivable , but neither is it a certainty , '' S&P said last week in a report that concluded state and local governments were so far managing the BP leak ably .

Underwater robots scanned the sea floor for signs the undersea well was damaged . `` We 've seen no negative evidence of any breaching there , '' said Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production . The tests showed the cap was building pressure in the well , meaning it was strong enough to contain the oil without leaking . The Coast Guard confirmed pressure was high enough to allow BP to test through Friday evening . Obama , speaking at the White House , cautiously welcomed the news . `` We wo n't be done until we actually know that we 've killed the well and that we have a permanent solution in place . We 're moving in that direction , but I do n't want us to get too far ahead of ourselves . '' The U.S. leader is under fire to push BP to permanently plug the leak and clean up an environmental and economic mess across five U.S. Gulf states . The spill has cut into multi-billion dollar fishing , tourism and drilling industries . The offshore spill , the worst in U.S. history , has spewed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf . Several previous attempts to plug the leak did not work , and investors remained cautious on BP 's latest effort . The British energy giant 's shares , which fell about 50 percent in the first two months of the crisis but have gained 40 percent since late June , fell nearly 5 percent as part of a broader sell-off on the New York Stock Exchange . They inched higher in London . BP began pressure tests on the well Thursday afternoon and expected them to last up to 48 hours . It then aims to siphon up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day using a seal installed earlier this week and send it a mile up to waiting ships . Estimates had put the spill rate at between 35,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- and 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- a day . The tests will show whether the cap is strong enough to contain the oil if the ships must disconnect from the well during a hurricane or other emergency . BP still expects to complete drilling a new well by early August to intersect the ruptured well and seal it with mud and cement . The capping of the well came nearly three months after an oil rig explosion ruptured the well and killed 11 men . But some residents in battered coastal communities remained skeptical . `` This is only the second day . I am not celebrating anything yet , '' Cindy Nelson of Biloxi said . Under pressure from Obama , BP has established a $ 20-billion fund to cover the costs of the spill . Three analysts surveyed by Reuters Insider television forecast the company will pay between $ 63 billion to $ 100 billion over the next 15 years in fines and cleanup and legal costs . Peter Hutton , an analyst at NCB Securities in London , pegged the total cost at $ 40 billion . `` It 's relief all around to see that -LRB- undersea -RRB- camera with no oil coming out , '' said Hutton . `` But people recognize that they 're not completely out of the woods . '' Investors welcomed reports that BP was moving closer to sealing the first deal in its planned $ 10 billion of non-core divestments to help pay cleanup costs . The company and bankers were finalizing details of the asset sales , including some U.S. interests to Apache Corp , said CNBC and the Financial Times . The crisis has complicated U.S. relations with close ally Britain . Many Britons believe Washington is treating BP too harshly , to the detriment of British pension funds and other investors who have big stakes in the company . The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to ask BP officials to testify after the company said it had lobbied the British government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Britain 's foreign minister in a phone call on Friday that Britain may want to communicate with the U.S. Congress about Libyan intelligence officer Abdel Basset al-Megrahi release . The Scottish government denied on Friday it had any contact with BP before its decision last year to release the Libyan . U.S. lawmakers also are considering a range of new rules that could impose tougher safety regulations on offshore drilling or bar companies like BP from new offshore exploration leases . The Obama administration issued a revised offshore drilling moratorium this week after a previous six-month ban was struck down by the courts . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Anyway , Those who think that BP is going to sink and troll up and down , They are unaware of the facts that BP will go up to cross $ 158 marks as this stock will stay advance with multiple interests . Those interest will provide quadrpulet fsi to the gauge while the problems follow it in the background and pay off every single claim . what the bloody hell are you saying ? do you speak english ?? does n't sound like American either ... it 's not Australian that 's for sure This discussion is now closed .

For weeks people on both sides of the Atlantic have been speculating over who would lose his job first because of the BP spill Ken Salazar , the interior secretary , or Tony Hayward , the oil company s chief executive . Given last week s initial progress in capping the well , I won t try to name a favorite in that race . But I would like to suggest a third , inanimate , culprit : the cult of corporate social responsibility . As crude poured into the Gulf of Mexico and the world economy struggled to recover from the financial crisis , corporate social responsibility might seem a perverse target . Surely we need more corporate responsibility , not less . But many of the business disasters of the past 24 months have been facilitated by the mini-industry of corporate social responsibility known as CSR by those in the trade a fetish encouraged by the philanthropies that feed off it and funded by the corporate executives who have found that it serves their bottom line . Consider BP s Beyond Petroleum campaign . Before the spill transformed that slogan into a punch line for late-night comedians , Madison Avenue had lauded BP s effort to position itself as the greenest fossil fuel producer : Beyond Petroleum won two PRWeek campaign of the year awards and a gold Effie from the American Marketing Association . Ogilvy , the firm that invented the slogan , still boasts of Beyond Petroleum as a successful case study on its Web site . Or how about Goldman Sachs s 10 ,000 Women project ? This initiative to organize and fund business education for 10,000 underserved women around the world is the limousine of CSR drives : smart , innovative and absolutely in tune with Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn s Half the Sky zeitgeist . But the gulf oil spill and the financial crisis have taught us , rather brutally , that the heart of the relationship between business and society doesn t lie with the charitable deeds companies do in their off-hours but whether they are doing their day jobs in ways that help or hurt the rest of us . While BP was winning plaudits for being the first oil company to accept global warming as a scientific fact , the old-school Texas oilmen at ExxonMobil were unfashionably unapologetic about their core mission : to produce oil . Chastened by the Exxon Valdez disaster , however , they also became religious about safety standards . With hindsight , that attention to safety turns out to have had much greater social value than any number of creative CSR drives . The same story played out on Wall Street . So much of the wealth of the gilded early naughties trickled down into 10,000-women-style clever charitable initiatives that my friends Matthew Bishop and Michael Green were inspired to coin a term to describe the phenomenon : philanthro-capitalism . Yet the considerable social good done by those projects pales in comparison with the destruction wreaked by the made-on-Wall Street financial crisis of 2007-08 . The problem with CSR is that it muddies the waters . Goldman s purpose isn t to educate women ; BP s isn t to lead the green revolution . The job of business is to make money in BP s case by producing energy , particularly fossil fuels ; in Goldman s case through finance . Even the most cuddly , caring chief executive is ultimately charged with a selfish central mission : to generate profit for her shareholders . Forgetting that core goal which the CSR culture can tempt us to do is bad news for business leaders . It was a sad day for American capitalism this spring when Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein decided that it was politically unsafe to admit to Congress that he is very good at his job : in this instance , making the right bet on subprime mortgages . Even more deplorable was the moment a year earlier when President Obama used his bully pulpit to bully business in this instance , the Chrysler bondholders , whose only sin was to stand up for economic self-interest and that of their investors . But getting confused about the principal job of business is even more dangerous for the state . CSR , and the communitarian philosophy behind it , asks us to believe that the interests of an individual company and those of the wider community are fully aligned . They aren t a truth too many regulators forgot in recent years . Corporate social responsibility sounds as unobjectionable as motherhood and apple pie and it would indeed be crazy to object to rich companies writing big checks for good causes . But we shouldn t let that distract us from the fact that the chief social responsibility of business is to make a buck and the social responsibility of government is to be sure that perfectly proper corporate greed is channeled and constrained for the greater good of us all . this is a comment about a different topic : your appearance this July -LRB- week of July 12 -RRB- on PBS , discussing the financial regulations passed by Congress . I really , really enjoyed your use of metaphor when you were being interviewed . Here are a couple of examples : if you want to use a traffic metaphor , what we have discovered in hindsight is that capital was moving too fast . The speed limits were too high , and there were n't enough air bags , and there were n't enough seat belts in the system . The goal , broadly speaking , of this legislation is to lower the speed limit of financial capital and to require all of us to wear seat belts . Now , the good news is , I think the legislation succeeds in doing that , maybe not 100 percent , but to some extent . And that should mean that car crashes , you know , 100 car crashes are a little bit less likely in the future . And later in the show : when we look back at the financial crisis of 2008 , one of the conclusions we 're going to draw is , regulators forgot that their job was to be policemen . And they started to see themselves as farmers , if you were , of Wall Street . They started to think that their job was to help financial services to grow . Now , that might be the job of other parts of government , but , surely , the job of regulators is to make sure these guys are not doing things which are too risky . It is difficult for financial reporters to write this well , let alone speak this clearly . I can see why your rise has been so rapid . Tony Blair should be CEO of BP ... as soon as they get this leak plugged . `` Making a buck '' is the same no matter how it is done . The world where either of these are true may have once existed , but it does n't any longer . Social responsibility is n't just PR glitz , it 's long-term solutions to long-term problems , and the companies which address these problems in the most sustainable ways will not only keep the world turning and getting better every day , but outlast and out-earn companies focused on short term profits . If this is n't an alignment of shareholder 's interests and the interests of the global community , I do n't know what is . When it comes to social responsibility , individuals as well as organizations have to think long term . Money is only one component of profit . If the communities in which you do business begin to fail , then your business will by necessity , fail in those communities as well . With that in mind , businesses and individuals must not engage in activity that is harmful to society . But how do you know what 's `` harmful to society '' ? You ca n't measure it with some kind of formula . Therefore the only way to do this is individually by obeying the primary law of `` love your neighbor as yourself '' . People with little or no understanding will scoff at this . But more people are waking up to the undeniable truth of it . Follow the link below and decide for yourself . alrite ill admit jonares got alittle carried away with how important CSR is , but hes rite it is important for profit . CSR isnt done to the point wher it is a liability for the company , it is done to the point where the marketing benefit is optimized . For an energy company this is alot , because almost all energy companys engage in CSR to promote ther use over substitutes . For an oil company it is imperative to keep public opinion in favor or prolonged use of fossil fuels , as widespread efforts to reduce them will lead to oil companys operating in an elastic business , one they do not wish to be part of at all . I see what the authors trying to say , but your point on CSR being a serious liability rather than a long term beneficial inconvenience sounds off from the point of a marketing director who uses CSR to keep customers from finding alternatives . Greed , corporate or otherwise , is NOT acceptable . Greed is the very essence of egoism . Egoism is the desire to take all you can while thinking nothing of the other . Egoism ties us to animal behavior . Therefore greed is not good . It is needed in order to show us the difference between receiving for ourselves and bringing benefit to others . In the first instance -LRB- receiving for the self -RRB- there is a never ending quest for `` more '' . And it does n't matter how many `` values '' a person has to `` compromise '' in order to get what they want . Every human being on earth behaves this way . But that does n't mean it is acceptable or even healthy to remain that way . We have to recognize our interdependence . Unless we wake up to this fact our problems will only get worse . Take a moment to look at a short video clip about the natural law of interdependence . You will understand that greed is indeed not good . Of course you do n't Have To , check out the link . But then again , if you want to look like you know what you 're talking about , you might want to know about the alternative to greed . The world economies will get a balance when the fundamentals of a capitalism society are protected from manipulators : This simple equation could force a seeking balance . investment = investment + profit gambling = gaining or losing Allowing a combined effect of greed + fears mars the regular functioning of offer + demand easily can lead to catastrophes like that one in 2008 . Easy profit is so close to easy losses that leaders are failing to protect the functioning of society . There is a lesson about advanced countries and societies . They are not as intelligent and superior as they were assuming as they are leading on many catastrophes from economic , obesity , and even environmental ones . When a person shows a high IQ profile I look at the size of the belly to see if any advanced brain performance is employed on adopting a healthy lifestyle . Do those wise guys know what is important in life ? I am trying to figure out about the difference of dying old poor\\/unknown or rich\\/famous . Perhaps rich people die better and by using secrets accounts would have savings for eternal life . Check the link in my last post . There actually are answers to the global situation . It just requires individual acceptance and responsibility . The discussion in the US is out of focus and ill informed . Let me remind you of the following facts . BP is meetings it 's obligations , even though it did not itself cause the disaster . The two American companies that were primarily responsible , TransOcean and Haliburton have cleverly kept media attention on BP . Fortunately for the wildlife and fisherman of the Gulf of Mexico , BP is acting in an honorable fashion . Compare the action of BP with the American Company , Union Carbide , which caused the biggest environmental disaster on the Planet , when over 15000 people were killed at Bhopal in India . The attitude of Americans in general & Obama in particular is causing intense irritation in the UK . It is your insatiable demand for cheap oil and gas that has caused this disaster . I read this pretzel of an article and am having a hard time following your logic . `` the chief social responsibility of business is to make a buck '' , you say , in the best tone-deaf , last-century rabid capitalist meme . `` any of the business disasters of the past 24 months have been facilitated by the mini-industry of corporate social responsibility ... . '' REALLY ???? So capitalists are blaming social responsibility for BPs results this quarter ? Why the heck are you bringing up Madison Avenue advetisers ... . they just mix the koolaid ! Here is a suggestion : replace `` shareholders '' with `` stakeholders '' , read up on the triple bottom line , -LRB- social , environmental , and financial bottom lines -RRB- or TBL . You may desperately want to turn a blind eye to the concept of companies needing to behave sustainably in order to survive , but IT S THE FUTURE !! Companies like BP do not have a chance in hell of being SUSTAINABLE in order to benefit its shareholders , period . There is a point where capitalism turns into cannibalism , but I digress . Yuck , I feel like I ve just been dipped into the Gulf of Mexico . This is an interesting article , honest and hard-headed . The CSR is a broader category of which `` green washing '' is a part . The system called for , though is a cat and mouse game . And in the U.S. , where money is speech , the mouse owns the cat . I find myself agreeing and disagreeing with your post at the same time . I think the central problem is that the term CSR means different things to different people . To BP , it meant a variety of things , and these definitions seemed to have shifted over time . Lord Browne took an important stand on climate change , but the company s real financial commitment to alternative energy paled in comparison to its promotion of its Beyond Petroleum image . That s not CSR , that s greenwash or propaganda to use an older term . BP also committed to greater public transparency about all aspects of its business , including its safety and environmental record . It disclosed , for example , how many spills it caused each year , and how many gallons were spilled . Most of BP s peers will not disclose this information . That commitment to transparency is also CSR . Your fear that CSR will distract business leaders from their central purpose is exaggerated . There is absolutely no risk that public companies will ever forget to pursue profit . That is a sure recipe for bankruptcy . Many companies , however , have forgotten their obligations to make money within the rules of the game to use Milton Friedman s phrase . If a company can not make money without killing people and destroying the environment , it has no right to be in business . The greater risk is that investors , consumers , communities , reporters , and business leaders will fail to take a hard enough look at a company s CSR efforts , and fail to see what s truly important . Worker health and safety and environmental compliance are core responsibilities all oil and gas companies owe to society . The company s obligation to make money is constrained by its obligation to do so safely and responsibly . Before the accident , BP was one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization . That is sufficient evidence that most investors did not bother to examine BP s frightening safety record before choosing to buy its stock . I agree that corporate philanthropy is nice , but insufficient . That is no reason to paint all CSR activities with the same brush . There are many companies that take CSR quite seriously , working to embed these concepts into their core business operations . There are many , many examples . The fact that BP is not one of them does not mean that the whole concept is bankrupt . I also agree that CSR can never replace effective regulation . No regulator , however , will ever be able to fully and effectively constrain the worlds public companies set loose without any internal ethical or moral guidelines except to make money . This is particularly true for companies with global operations . There is no single government with the power or the authority to regulate all operations by a multinational . In the end , we need both effective regulation and strong CSR programs . We also need more conscientious investors who are willing to demand more responsible behavior . CSR has become much more effective since the focus has moved from avoidance -LRB- of sin stocks -RRB- to shareowner activism . Of course it is the government 's job to channel the power of corporations and to ensure against externalizing costs . However , who do you think largely controls the government ? As a lobbyist , I spent years writing California 's legislation . Typically bills were written or amended by the very industry lobbyists the legislation appeared to regulate . I came to the conclusion that we are n't likely to have governments that operate democratically until we have businesses and other institutions that are also more democratically governed . Shareowners , for example , are charged with electing corporate directors but we ca n't even nominate directors without going through a very expensive proxy contest . Even proxy access would only give us the ability to nominate a token few . I agree with a recent report , `` Compensation Complicity : Mutual Fund Proxy Voting and the Overpaid American CEO , '' by AFSCME , The Corporate Library and Shareowners.org which analyzed mutual fund voting patterns . The Report offers two action recommendations : 1 . Retail investors in mutual funds , should critically evaluate how their mutual funds vote . New tools such as those available at Proxydemocracy.org make this task much easier . -LRB- For example , see their ranking of votes on : director elections , executive compensation , corporate governance , and corporate impact . Please send them a donation to support their work . Another excellent source of information is Jackie Cook s Fund Votes . -RRB- Investors should consider shifting their investments from fund families whose voting practices and records are not responsible to fund families with more responsible practices and records , provided the fee and performance characteristics of the funds are comparable . If more responsible fund families are not available for example , because the investor s investment is made through an employer-sponsored benefit plan with limited investment choices the investor should lobby for expanded choices .

Thad Allen , the top U.S. oil spill official , said the energy company could continue for 24 more hours a pressure test at the well , which was capped last week . BP shares took a beating on Monday following news that engineers detected seepage on the ocean floor after the well was capped . The stock recovered in New York after BP and Allen said scientists had determined the seepage was not related to the well . `` We do not believe that is associated with this particular ... test or the Macondo well , '' Allen told reporters , referring to the seepage detected about 3 km -LRB- 1.9 miles -RRB- from the well . BP 's New York shares dropped more than 6 percent as investors sold on fears the seepage could signal that the April 20 blowout of the well might have damaged it , causing oil or gas to leak out the sides or possibly breach the seabed . Shares in New York recovered on the news the seepage was unrelated to the well , finishing down 3.64 percent . In the test , which began on Thursday , officials are monitoring the pressure in the well to gauge whether it is structurally sound . An intact well would help when a relief well intercepts and tries to plug the leak , but damage could complicate that effort . The worst oil spill in U.S. history has caused an economic and environmental disaster in five states along the Gulf Coast , hurt President Barack Obama 's approval ratings and complicated traditionally close ties with Britain . BP said in a statement that it had spent $ 3.95 billion on efforts to tackle the well and clean up the millions of barrels of spilled oil . The explosion that led to the spill and a three-month long effort to plug the leak and clean up the oil has hit BP 's finances . BP has started canvassing shareholders about a restructuring that could include a breakup of its businesses , the Sunday Times reported . BP talks to sell half its stake in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay oil field to Apache Corp , which stalled over the weekend , were back on , CNBC reported . As part of a test of the well , BP choked off the flow a mile under the water 's surface with a cap on Thursday , marking the first time oil has not spewed since the April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers . The company was extending the test in 24-hour intervals , pending U.S. government approval . The latest extension lasts until Tuesday afternoon . BP hopes to keep the damaged well shut until a relief well intercepts it and kills the well by mid-August , BP 's chief operating officer of exploration and production Doug Suttles , said on Sunday . But Allen has said when the pressure test ends , BP would `` immediately '' move to begin siphoning oil again to a pair of oil-capture vessels and move to a larger four-vessel siphoning system as planned by the end of July . Suttles ' statement could indicate diverging views between BP and the U.S. government . Yet BP has repeatedly said the final say of how BP proceeds lies with Allen . On Monday Allen appeared to leave open the possibility of keeping the well capped and shut . He said it was hard to say whether BP will return to that siphoning system . He also said installation of BP 's oil-capture vessel system , designed to handle up to 80,000 barrels a day , could be delayed by a few days as seismic and acoustic sensor vessels scan the area for possible wellhead and seabed anomalies . `` We are negotiating how to trade off and prioritize long-term containment , '' Allen said . ROLE OF BP IN LIBYA BOMBER DEAL The oil spill is likely to loom large when British Prime Minister David Cameron meets Obama in Washington this week . The White House said the company 's role in the release of the Lockerbie bomber from a Scottish prison will also come up . BP has confirmed that it lobbied the UK government in late 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya , but said it was not involved in talks on the release of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , convicted of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight . The British government said it had no plans to re-examine a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya , despite demands by U.S. lawmakers for an investigation . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told senators who had demanded an investigation that the United States was urging Scottish and British authorities to review the circumstances leading to Megrahi 's release . Cameron 's visit comes as U.S. lawmakers are considering a range of rules that could require tougher safety regulations on offshore drilling or bar companies like BP from new offshore exploration leases . BP is also trying to figure out a possible restructuring of its business . The Sunday Times said options included selling the group 's refineries and petrol stations , scaling back U.S. operations and ramping up in-house engineering instead of outsourcing .

His positions , statements and opinions are , in my opinion , those of a unschooled private citizen . The Coast Guard is part of the problem at this point . They should be directing ship traffic -- not working with oil wells . @Impeach ... you do realize you 're a bit crazy , right ? It would seem that rather then release more oil into the Gulf , that pressure could be relieved by attaching hoses to the cap and pumping the to ship on surface . His idea to remove the cap cholke completely show his lack of knowledge and experience . ITs not and all or none situation . So reduce pressure by adding hoses to cap instead fo testing more and allowing pressure to build . There is no good reason to allow pressure to build if it can be safely pumped to surface .

HOUSTON\\/WASHINGTON | Tue Jul 20 , 2010 7:38 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - British energy giant BP Plc said on Tuesday it reached a $ 7 billion deal with Apache Corp , a large part of its planned sale of $ 10 billion in assets to pay for the worst oil spill in U.S. history . BP said Apache would pay a $ 5 billion cash deposit on July 30 as part of the deal for exploration and production facilities in North America and Egypt . The company said the deal , worth a total of $ 7 billion , would include assets in New Mexico , natural gas in western Canada and concessions in Egypt . BP 's share price ended 1.54 percent lower in New York on Tuesday at $ 35.20 . Earlier in the day , it announced it would sell $ 1.7 billion worth of assets in Vietnam and Pakistan . The continuing disaster in the Gulf remains high on the American and British political agendas and dominated a visit to Washington by British Prime Minister David Cameron . Cameron praised BP for the steps it has taken to plug the leak and to pay for damages suffered by people in the Gulf . U.S. officials on Tuesday gave BP 's latest effort -- a cap that has stopped the gusher -- another 24 hours for pressure tests on the seal . The Gulf 's vital tourism and fishing industries have been devastated by the millions of gallons of oil that have hit coastal beaches and marshes , threatening an ecological catastrophe on a grand scale . The spill also has hurt President Barack Obama 's approval ratings and complicated traditionally close ties with Britain . Rig operator Ensco Plc filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging the Obama administration 's new deepwater oil drilling moratorium , saying it was mostly the same as the first ban that a U.S. court already put on hold . Ensco , in a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana , said the Interior Department `` did not analyze the situation anew and with an open mind when deciding to impose the second moratorium . '' The BP asset sales were announced exactly three months after an explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers and caused the crude to flow into the Gulf of Mexico . BP has committed to raise $ 10 billion in the coming year to pay for damage claims , the cleanup and legal costs related to the leaking well . BP , which said on Monday it had spent about $ 3.95 billion so far on the oil spill , agreed under intense pressure from U.S. authorities last month to set up an independently administered $ 20 billion escrow fund for damage claims . The Obama administration has stressed that the amount is not a cap on the company 's liabilities . During a visit with Obama , Cameron said he understood U.S. anger at BP because of the oil spill . He also said it was important to both the U.S. and British economies that the company stay strong and stable . TEST TO CONTINUE ; `` STATIC KILL '' ? The U.S. government on Tuesday approved another 24-hour extension of a pressure test of the well . The broken well was capped last week -- at least temporarily -- after spilling up to 60,000 barrels a day of crude for three months . The well test , which has been extended in 24-hour increments by the U.S. government , will continue until Wednesday afternoon and then be re-evaluated for a possible further extension . Scientists are now weighing another option -- a `` static kill '' to help smother and plug the leak . The top U.S. oil spill official said BP could have a plan to proceed with the static kill option within 24 hours . This would involve pumping heavy drilling mud and possibly cement into the well , much like BP 's failed `` top kill '' in May . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

The following is a look at how the spill has weighed on the company so far and how it could continue to affect its business : BP , which was Britain 's largest company by market value at the time of explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , has seen its market capitalization fall about 36 percent to 75.2 billion pounds -LRB- $ 114.9 billion -RRB- . BP pumped 4.0 million barrels of oil equivalent of oil and gas in 2009 -- more than any other non-government controlled oil company in the world . The spill will hit BP 's ambition to increase output 1 to 2 percent in the coming years . BP has said disruption due to the spill would knock more than 1 percent off next year 's output and this week agreed to sell fields that pump 2 percent of its total output as it seeks to raise cash to pay for the spill . Citigroup expects disposals to reduce output by 5 percent . CASH PILE : AROUND $ 45 BILLION BP expects cash flow of $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion from operations this year , $ 18 billion of which is reserved for capital investment . BP agreed to sell Apache Corp $ 7 billion in assets this week and has invited offers for Asian gas assets worth $ 1.7 billion . BP sources have said more assets could be sold . BP said last month it had undrawn bank lending facilities of $ 10 billion and sources familiar with the matter said it had secured another $ 7 billion in recent weeks . - Cleanup costs of $ 6 billion to 9 billion - Compensation to victims of $ 14 billion to 22 billion - Fines and punitive damages awards of $ 3 - $ 37 billion - Other actual and potential costs , including grants to states , commitments to research and legal fees , which could run to several billion dollars BP will bear 100 percent of the costs to related to the spill if its partners in the field are successful in their claim of `` gross negligence '' on the part of BP . If they fail , BP will be responsible for 65 percent . BP is expected to offset most of the costs against tax . With a forecast 34 percent average tax rate , this could reduce the hit to the BP 's balance sheet by more than a third . Analysts have speculated BP may not seek tax relief on all costs , similar to Boeing , which declined to seek a deduction for any of a $ 615 million settlement with the government in 2006 over ethics charges after it was pressured by lawmakers . Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated the disaster could also reduce the value of BP 's Gulf of Mexico assets by $ 16 billion to 24 billion . - Refineries , renewable energy , other assets : $ 31 billion to $ 62 billion Many BP investors have said they want BP leadership to change .

Yes , BP is stalling . I doubt they are stalling for money . It 's not that . I just do n't think they know the answers to the questions -LRB- by claimants -RRB- , '' Feinberg told reporters . Feinberg was speaking on the sidelines of a town hall meeting in southern Alabama at which fishermen and other business owners expressed frustration and anger at what they say is a slow and complex claims process that lacks transparency . Thousands of businesses in U.S. Gulf Coast states have been crippled by the oil spill , which began with an explosion and fire on a BP deepwater rig in April . Saturday 's remarks represented the first time that Feinberg , named last month to administer the fund , had accused BP of holding up compensation payments . BP set up the fund in June under pressure from President Barack Obama . `` After today there will be no more business as usual . I learned today the depth of frustration in people here on the coast , '' Feinberg told the meeting . Under the terms of the compensation fund , people have 90 days from when the undersea well is permanently sealed to file claims -- a limitation Alabama 's attorney general has said needs to be changed . Feinberg said he was taking the attorney general 's comments `` under advisement '' and said the 90-day deadline only applies to emergency funds . `` People are getting confused with the emergency checks , '' Feinberg said . There is also confusion about who is qualified to make a claim . Feinberg said he is still tweaking the rules for those who are indirectly affected by the oil spill , such as small businesses in the tourism industry . Real estate brokers and bankers are also asking to be compensated for lost sales related to the spill . Feinberg said he does not yet know whether they will be included . Addressing the frustrated crowd in Alabama , Feinberg said when he takes complete control over administering the fund `` we will not do anything behind your back . '' BP has been managing compensation so far but Feinberg is due to take full control by August 10 . Feinberg , an arbitration lawyer , also oversaw compensation for executives at companies that received federal bailout funds . Feinberg also dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States . -LRB- Reporting by Leigh Coleman , writing by Matthew Bigg and Rachelle Younglai , editing by Will Dunham -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

LONDON | Sun Jul 25 , 2010 12:55 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc -LRB- BP . L -RRB- will give an estimate for the total cost of its Gulf of Mexico oil spill next Tuesday when it unveils second-quarter profits that , were it not for the spill , would likely have risen 77 percent to $ 5 billion -LRB- 3.2 billion pounds -RRB- . Accounting rules force BP to make a provision for the likely costs related to its leaking Macondo well , which spewed up to 60,000 barrels of crude a day for three months until it was capped last week . Analysts are predicting BP will face a final bill of between $ 15 billion and $ 60 billion . The wide range reflects uncertainties over the cost of the clean up and compensating those effected , the level of fines and whether BP 's partners in the well will share the burden . `` With so many unknowns , BP has quite rightly dodged the question as to the total cost up until now . People will be very interested to see if the provision is more than the $ 30 billion figure that a lot of analysts are converging on , '' said Will Riley co-manager of the Guinness Global Energy Fund , which holds BP shares . BP spent around $ 3 billion in the second quarter on the containment and clean up operation . This should be more than covered by its earnings . `` Whether balance sheet gearing rises or falls will probably depend on the scale of provisioning rather than cash effects , '' Gordon Gray , oil analyst at Collins Stewart , said in a note . However , BP 's provision will likely only be a fraction of the total bill it will potentially face . For one , the estimate of fines included in the provision is likely to be below the maximum possible in law . Under the Clean Water Act , a polluter faces fines of $ 1,100 per barrel for a spillage , although this can be increased to $ 4,300 if the spill is deemed to be due to gross negligence . BP is expected to assume it will not be found guilty of gross negligence in setting its estimate of likely fines . This also implies BP 's provision assumes its partners will contribute , as proving gross negligence is the only basis on which Anadarko Petroleum -LRB- APC . N -RRB- and Mitsui -LRB- 8031 . T -RRB- will not be liable for their share -- 35 percent -- of the total bill . Consequently , the charge taken next week is unlikely to be the last . `` It will be a permanent feature in the results for some time , '' Tony Shepard at Charles Stanley said . Investors will also be looking for reassurance BP has the firepower to deal with the longer-term liabilities . The group , which agreed a $ 7 billion asset sale on Tuesday , said last month it had $ 5 billion in cash on hand and $ 10 billion in bank lending facilities , while banking sources said the group was also lining up more debt facilities . The company could further bolster its position next week by outlining plans to raise another $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion by securitising cash flows from its assets , one industry banker said . `` We believe BP is able to fund up to $ 34 billion of costs and liabilities pretax -LRB- $ 29 billion post-tax -RRB- over the next 18 months , '' analysts at Credit Suisse said in a research note . Questions about the future of Chief Executive Tony Hayward are expected to resurface , but investors and analysts do not expect him to step down in the near future , although , longer term , Hayward 's position is appearing increasingly untenable . `` Providing the cap and relief wells work , we imagine he 'll be there for the clean up and will almost certainly then be on his way , '' a top-10 shareholder said on condition of anonymity . `` The whole operation post explosion has not been managed that well , so somebody has to pay and the CEO and Chairman seem obvious -LRB- targets -RRB- . '' Yet sources close to the company said if BP ditched Hayward before the well was capped and significant progress made on the cleanup , his successor could also tarred by the spill fallout . Apart from the oil spill , BP 's core business is booming . Last month , refining boss Iain Conn , who was effectively running BP while Hayward was overseeing the oil spill response , said core operations were running `` very effectively . '' It was a typically understated comment from the Scotsman and a Reuters poll of 11 analysts gave an average forecast of $ 4.98 billion for BP 's underlying net profits , a 77 percent rise on the same period last year . Higher oil and gas prices and stronger refining margins are expected to boost all the big oil companies , but analysts at Citigroup said BP 's predicted result `` represents the strongest momentum in the peer group . '' The London-based company is also expected to brave a another potential public relations quagmire by revealing it will offset its spill-related costs against tax . `` If you make lower profits , you should pay lower taxes , '' one source said close to the company said .

Adjusters passing out emergency funds in Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states are on high alert for fraud even as they pay out legitimate claims following the April 20 oil rig explosion and spill that killed 11 workers and devastated the livelihoods of many fishermen , tourism workers and others . The promise of a handout has attracted the unscrupulous , who have flocked to the Gulf in a bid to cash in . Scott Ward , assistant manager of the BP claims office in Boothville , Louisiana , recalls staring at the long , manicured fingernails of the purported deckhand who sat across his desk one day asking for compensation . The woman , who was `` all gussied up , '' bore little resemblance to the hardened workers he knew made their living on the water , Ward said . `` How can you separate shrimp with those nails ? '' `` She had the proper documentation so we paid her , but you have to wonder . '' Another applicant was overheard telling fellow claimants in the waiting room she was a stripper on New Orleans ' famed Bourbon Street , said Burnell Alessi , the office 's manager . `` Every time we think we 've seen it all , there 's a new one that comes in , '' Alessi said . BP has so far paid $ 201 million out of its $ 20 billion fund to residents and businesses in Gulf Coast states . Fishermen and shrimpers have received $ 50 million of that pie . But of the 114,000 claims submitted , nearly 54 percent , or more than 61,000 , lack key documentation , according to BP . Although many fishermen , shrimpers , oystermen and others have complained of red tape , BP says it is working diligently to quickly process and pay claims . The process has been flexible to allow for unforeseen issues , like claimants without their paperwork in perfect order , but that may have opened the door to fraud . `` We are trying to have a process that is workable that addresses genuine need , '' said BP 's government and public affairs director , Ron Rybarczyk . `` It was not a perfect system . We erred on the side of ... putting it in motion before we examined every angle . '' There are 36 claims offices throughout the Gulf states . In early August , the claims process will transfer from BP to Kenneth Feinberg , a high-powered attorney tasked by President Obama to oversee the damage claims process . Speaking recently at a town hall meeting in Houma , Louisiana , Feinberg stressed his willingness to pay legitimate claimants who might not have perfect documentation . `` Tell the captain of your boat or your priest or your sheriff or your mayor , come on in and vouch for you , '' he said . `` I have to get something to avoid fraud , to verify your claim , but I 'm not looking to get fancy here , '' Feinberg said . `` I 'm looking to get the money out to people who need it . I 'm working for you . Let 's get creative on corroboration . I will then bend over backwards . '' But that willingness to pay has opened the door to trouble , locals say . `` You see people who have n't been down here in 20 years showing up at that claims office , '' said shrimper Marvin Davis , who reported one out-of-towner trying to game the system . In one scam making the circuit , boat captains vouch for purported out-of-work deckhands who then share with the captains a cut of their BP payment . Adjusters are now wise to the scheme , using a boat registration number that can show whether a boat with a capacity for four workers , for example , has a phantom crew of double that number -- all seeking funds . Applications for Louisiana commercial fishing licenses also reveal potential schemes in motion . The department of wildlife and fisheries processed applications for 85 such licenses on April 9th , about a week before the spill . A month later , that number rose 44 percent to 122 applications , following the news that BP would pay claims to fishermen with active licenses . `` Why would you need a commercial fishing license when you know the fishing is closed ?

Bob Dudley , who will replace gaffe-prone Tony Hayward as CEO on October 1 , said safety would be among his highest priorities as he tries to refurbish the oil company 's battered reputation . Image repair may become even tougher after BP said it would offset the cost of the spill against its taxes , costing U.S. taxpayers almost $ 10 billion . BP reported a second-quarter loss of $ 17 billion , including $ 32 billion in charges related to the oil spill , the largest in U.S. history . It also announced plans to sell $ 30 billion in assets over the next 18 months to help cover its liabilities . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice have launched `` informal enquiries '' into securities matters related to the spill , BP said . A Senate probe into whether BP influenced the release of the Lockerbie bomber added yet another source of friction . Senator Robert Menendez postponed a hearing on the matter , scheduled for Thursday , and accused BP and British officials of stonewalling . More than 5 million barrels of oil have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico since the undersea leak began in late April , according to U.S. government estimates . The spill , caused by an explosion that killed 11 people , has devastated communities and fragile ecosystems along the Gulf Coast , killing or injuring countless sea creatures and coastal birds . Private lawsuits have piled up . Attorneys hoping to lead the legal fight against BP are heading to the unlikely venue of Boise , Idaho , this week as a special judicial panel considers how to handle all the cases . BP 's U.S.-listed shares closed 1.7 percent lower on Tuesday . BP shares in London closed 2.6 percent lower . The company has lost about 40 percent of its market value since the explosion . Ted Parrish , co-portfolio manager of the Henssler Equity Fund in Kennesaw , Georgia , said the sheer size of BP 's quarterly loss had unsettled investors . Wall Street `` expected a big number , but to actually read the tape and see that number , it tends to shock people , '' he said . But aside from the spill , BP 's business is steaming ahead with underlying quarterly profits up 77 percent from the year before thanks to higher oil and gas prices and better refining margins . The stock had gained on Monday after reports surfaced that Hayward would be ousted as CEO after a series of public relations blunders , including complaining he wanted his `` life back '' weeks after the start of the spill . `` I believe that it is not possible for the company to move on in the United States with me remaining as the face to BP , '' Hayward told reporters on a conference call . `` So I think that for the good of BP , and particularly for the good of BP in the United States , it is right for me to ... step down . '' BP 's leaking well was capped two weeks ago after gushing up to 60,000 barrels per day into the Gulf , ruining fishing and tourism industries and polluting the shoreline with slimy goo . BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company would take a hard look at itself in the aftermath of the spill : `` BP ... will be a different company going forward . '' The White House said President Barack Obama spoke with Svanberg on Monday but declined to say what was discussed . Dudley , who will be the first American to lead BP , was raised in Mississippi , a fact that seems to be working in his favor among some Gulf residents . `` I think people would be more comfortable with someone running BP -LRB- who -RRB- is from the Deep South , '' said Richard Angelico , a 66-year-old lifelong resident of Orleans Parish , Louisiana . `` Hayward was inept at public relations and speaking to people in southern Louisiana . '' Dudley said on ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' he expected no more oil to flow into the Gulf , but added : `` we 've got to really kill that well to be absolutely certain . '' BP could begin the final procedure to permanently plug the well late next week . Some investors and analysts say BP 's culture encourages greater risk-taking than rivals , contributing to higher returns . Critics have also blamed this culture for the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig . Dudley told a conference call with reporters that safety `` is going to be one of my highest priorities , in addition to the focus on making sure we meet our obligations around the Gulf Coast . '' The spill looks likely to leave a legislative legacy . The Senate may begin debating a slimmed-down energy bill as early as Thursday , and holding BP accountable for cleaning up the Gulf will be a priority . BP said it planned to sell assets worth up to $ 30 billion over the next 18 months to pay for its liabilities and create a leaner company with the potential for higher growth . Investment bankers said the assets BP could sell include its stake in Alaska 's huge Prudhoe Bay oil field and its interest in Pan American Energy in Argentina , as well as smaller assets in Vietnam , Pakistan and Colombia . Industry executives said it was a good time to sell assets as relative stability in the oil price in the past nine months makes it easier for buyers and sellers to agree to deal terms . BP agreed to a $ 7 billion sale of oil and gas fields to Apache Corp last week , which valued the assets at around $ 19.40 per barrel of oil equivalent . The rest of BP trades at an implied $ 7\\/barrel , analysts at Morgan Stanley said . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . I did business with BP many years ago where my Company supplied them with pressure vessels and I found their practices unacceptable . I am surprised it has taken this long for them to get caught out . It is a very sad day when a gust of hot wind -LRB- Obama -RRB- and his cronies -LRB- the American people -RRB- can influence business so much in such a distorted fashion . As one commentator pointed out , Goldman Sachs deliberately polluted the world economy , being responsible for almost pulling down the entire system , yet they are only fined $ 550m -- after hearings and trials . Yet BP pollutes 4 states in one country and is ` fined ' $ 20b -- before any justice is permitted . Once again , the world bears witness to the arrogance of the US and unfortunately bears the brunt of its self centered attitude . Had this been a US company polluting the Greek or Australian\\/NZ coastlines it would be a completely different story . May God help us from the Americans . This discussion is now closed .

The powerful oil industry says it needs to tap resources off the Arctic archipelagoes of Lofoten and Vesteraalen and in a huge , recently demarcated Barents Sea border region with Russia to continue Norway 's oil boom amid dwindling North Sea output . But , emboldened by the Gulf of Mexico well blowout , Norwegian environmentalists seek to grab the upper hand in a battle they feel they have long been loosing . So far Oslo 's energy policy has not been affected much by the spill , but the drilling lobby is nervous . Norway is still Europe 's No. 2 energy supplier but its oil exports , at 2.13 million barrels per day in 2009 , are 31 percent below its 2001 peak . Natural gas sales are rising . Energy Minister Terje Riis-Johansen said this month that he was personally against opening the Lofotens archipelago . The government is expected to take up a position on opening the region to oil activities in early 2011 . `` Perhaps the Norwegian authorities will wait at least a few years with awarding licenses in previously unexplored Arctic areas , not to provoke the environmentalists and the population in general , '' said Bjoern Brochman , director of gas market analysis at Point Carbon , a Thomson Reuters company . For a graphic , click on : here Environmentalists warn that the oil industry is taking on more and more risk in the Arctic . It takes longer for oil to dissolve in freezing Arctic waters , while winter darkness and limited port facilities would hamper cleanup efforts . The seas off the Lofotens have unique cold water reefs and are the spawning grounds of the world 's largest cod stock . In the latest salvo , an eco group this week asked safety authorities to reject drilling requests by Statoil -LRB- STL . OL -RRB- and Italy 's ENI -LRB- ENI . MI -RRB- in a developed area of the Barents Sea , taking the fight to a region previously cleared for exploration . `` After such a catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico , it 's sensible to press the brake in these vulnerable areas , '' said Lars Haltbrekken , head of Friends of the Earth Norway . On the other side , the head of Norway 's influential LO union and ally of the Labor party in government said that failure to open up the Lofotens and other prospective Arctic areas would have a profound impact on Norwegian society . `` Not doing the -LRB- Lofoten -RRB- study would mean breaking with the political tradition that has turned Norway into the welfare state that it is today , '' Roar Flaathen told the daily VG . The country 's oil industry said a BP-type oil spill is highly unlikely offshore Norway because of tougher safety rules . But even as Norway remains one of the least polluted oil and gas producing regions in the world , the risks of offshore drilling , especially in deep waters , have now been fully exposed to an environmentally-sensitive Norwegian electorate . '' -LRB- The U.S. spill -RRB- was a reality check , an awakening for Norwegians that accidents happen and that production in deepwater is dangerous , '' said Point Carbon 's Brochman . Norway 's energy policy remains friendly for industry , however , with the latest offshore licensing round announced in June including all 12 previously envisaged deepwater blocks . The total number of blocks on offer was cut by just six to 94 following the spill , while Oslo 's halt on drilling in new deepwater areas is seen as largly symbolic . -LRB- ID : nLDE65M0VK -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "2110", "dct": "2010-07-29", "dates": ["2010-07-27", "2010-07-29", "2010-07-29", "2010-07-29", "2010-07-26", "2010-07-29", "2010-07-29", "2010-01-01", "2005-01-01", "2010-04-20", "2010-07-28", "2010-07-29"], "text": "Drill ships and response vessels work in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast line while attempting to drill relief wells at the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill wellhead July 27 , 2010 .

The panel , meeting in Boise , Idaho , as part of its regularly scheduled rotation among federal courts , did not immediately rule on how it would handle the mounting civil litigation brought against BP and other defendants involved in the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history . A decision is expected within several weeks . At stake is whether civil lawsuits from injured rig workers , fishermen , property owners , investors and others will be combined in Houston , where BP has its U.S. headquarters and wants the cases heard , or New Orleans , the preferred venue for many plaintiffs -- or elsewhere . Some lawyers argue the litigation is too massive for any one court to handle . The environmental havoc wreaked by the oil rig explosion that killed 11 workers could take years to reverse . A temporary cap has halted the gusher a mile below the sea 's surface while crews try to plug the well for good next week , but the massive spill has wrecked the Gulf 's fishing and tourism industries . BP could start its `` static kill '' plan to pump mud into the Macondo well -- the first in a two-step process to choke it off with mud and cement -- by this weekend , ahead of the scheduled start time on Monday , the top U.S. official dealing with the spill said on Thursday . `` There 's a chance that that schedule can be accelerated , '' retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters in New Orleans . He also said the U.S. government is laying the groundwork to shift its massive oil spill clean-up operation from acute disaster management to long-term recovery , and that the clean-up could take years . Millions of gallons of oil leaked into the ocean over nearly three months -- until the well was capped two weeks ago . But clean-up boats have found it increasingly hard to find oil on the surface and officials say much has dispersed or evaporated , although hundreds of miles of coastline are polluted with orange or black deposits . The disaster has posed a huge challenge for U.S. President Barack Obama , whose administration has tried to halt deep-sea oil drilling until the causes of the BP spill are clear . A U.S. court overturned a six-month moratorium imposed after the spill but the government is seeking a new one . Potentially adding its name to the line of claimants , Royal Dutch Shell Plc idled seven rigs and took a $ 56 million charge related to the drilling ban on Thursday . Saying the ban would reduce its production by almost 3 million barrels this year , the company did not rule out reclaiming the cash from BP . Shell , one of the biggest oil producers in the Gulf of Mexico , said it had idled rigs rather than move them elsewhere because the ban 's six-month duration meant it was not profitable to redeploy them to other areas . BP , which has created a $ 20 billion fund to compensate companies and individuals affected by the spill , declined comment on compensating Shell . Executives at the London-based group believe it is not liable for damages resulting from the ban . At the packed Boise federal courthouse , attorneys were given a few minutes each to make their case to the seven-judge panel during the hour-and-a-half-long hearing .

Passing the bill as the House leaves for its six-week recess gives lawmakers the opportunity to return home boasting they reined in Big Oil and held BP responsible for the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history . The vote was 209-193 on the bill supported by President Barack Obama . But first , Gulf Coast Democrats won an amendment ending the federal moratorium on deepwater drilling for oil companies that met new safety requirements . The Obama administration 's moratorium would end in November . By the time the full Congress completes action on this offshore drilling bill -- and it is uncertain that it will -- it could be November or later . A similar offshore drilling bill is pending in the Senate , without the House 's new provision to end the drilling moratorium . But it was unlikely that measure would pass before that chamber begins its summer recess on August 6 . House Republicans warned the bill would slash U.S. oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico , a major supplier of domestic energy , and cut high-paying drilling jobs . `` The Obama moratorium on deepwater drilling has already costs thousands of jobs and this bill will eliminate even more American energy jobs , making it harder and more expensive to produce both energy on and offshore , '' said Republican Representative Pete Sessions . `` It will drive American companies out of the Gulf , '' said Republican Representative Kevin Brady . `` This is a choice between American energy workers and foreign oil . '' Democrats said the bill would make offshore drilling safer for workers , while also protecting the environment and Gulf Coast business from future oil spills like the one caused by BP that damaged wetlands and hurt the region 's fishing and tourism industries . `` This legislation is about safety , about establishing new safety standards , safety for the workers on the rigs , '' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . `` If you want to apologize for Big Oil , go right ahead , but the American people are not on your side on this one , '' Democratic Representative Jim McGovern told his Republican colleagues during a long day of debate . Before passing the bill , the House also approved an amendment to help smaller oil companies compete for Gulf of Mexico drilling projects under the proposed reforms . The amendment would let them pool their resources in demonstrating they have the financial resources to deal with potential oil spills . The House vote on the bill was close , as several Democrats representing districts with strong oil industry interests joined Republicans in opposition . Representative Gene Green , from the oil industry-dominated city of Houston , was one of those Democrats . `` There are a lot of things in there that have nothing to do with safety '' of offshore drilling operations , Green told reporters . A sticking point in the Senate is opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats to removing all liability limits oil companies would face for economic damages stemming from the BP disaster and any future spills . Current law requires companies to only cover up to $ 75 million for damages to local economies . The BP spill could end up costing billions of dollars in lost tourism , fishing and other Gulf Coast revenues . BP has said it would pay for all costs related to the spill , but many lawmakers worry that the company could put victims through years of litigation . The Senate energy bill has an added component : new incentives to encourage more natural gas-powered trucks and electric vehicles to clean up the environment . It also provides $ 5 billion to help improve home energy efficiency . But Senate Democrats abandoned attempts to attach climate change provisions that would have set mandatory limits on some companies ' carbon dioxide emissions . Senate leaders plan to hold a test vote next Wednesday to gauge support for the bill , according to a Democratic aide . But Republicans , and possibly some moderate Democrats , might block a full debate , forcing senators to take it up in September . The House also approved a separate bill on Friday to give whistle-blower protection to workers who report violations in offshore drilling rules . -LRB- Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Sofina Mirza-Reid -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The executive director of the BP Amoco Marketers Association , John Kleine , said on Sunday his members were discussing the possibility of reverting to the Amoco brand . BP Plc. 's bought Amoco in 1998 and many current BP distributors used to be Amoco distributors . `` Yes , the Amoco question comes up in conversation -- driven by the goal of distributors to recapture fuels leadership in terms of quality , performance and sales , '' said Kleine said in an e-mail . Kleine added later in a telephone interview , however , that he has heard of no distributors changing the name of their operations from BP to Amoco . `` There is not rebranding to Amoco for sure , because that is a trademark name owned by BP , '' he said from Savannah , Georgia . `` With regard to rebranding from BP to another brand , I do n't know of a move under way for that to happen . '' Kleine said he knew of no move by U.S. distributors to break their contracts with BP or not to renew them . The association represents and is owned by 475 BP distributors located east of the Rocky Mountains . Millions of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil poured into the Gulf for three months after a rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the leak from a BP-owned well . The well was temporarily capped last month and BP hopes to seal it permanently this month . The worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history fouled beaches from Texas to Florida , devastating the Gulf coast fishing and tourism industries . Some environmental groups called for a boycott of BP gas stations . Kleine said the BP spill has had a psychological impact on distributors . He described it as a time of crisis and triage . `` That really comes from being concerned about their business , their livelihood , their investment , seeing every day the news that would tend to make you believe that the business is going to decline , '' Kleine said . `` And their question is how much ? So that 's a psychological impact , they do n't feel very good . '' He said he had no sales figures , but anecdotally , he said sales had declined for some distributors , especially along the Gulf Coast .

The area of hypoxia , or low levels of oxygen , covered 7,722 square miles -LRB- 20,000 square kilometers -RRB- of the bottom of the Gulf and extended far into Texas waters , researchers from the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium said in a statement late on Sunday . `` This is the largest such area off the upper Texas coast that we have found since we began this work in 1985 , '' said Nancy Rabalais , the consortium 's executive director . `` The total area probably would have been the largest if we had had enough time to completely map the western part -LRB- of the Gulf -RRB- . '' The annual summer `` dead zone '' in the Gulf is fueled by farm chemicals carried by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers . Nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural runoff stimulates algae growth in the Gulf . When these tiny plants or fecal matter from animals that eat them settles to the bottom waters , decomposition of this organic material by bacteria consumes oxygen in the water , the consortium said . The result , the researchers said , is oxygen depletion that forces many types of fish , shrimp and crabs to leave the area or suffocate . Animals that live in the sediments that can survive with little oxygen will die if the oxygen level falls toward zero . To be considered hypoxic , oxygen content in the bottom waters of the Gulf must reach the level of 2 parts per million or less . By late July , large patches of the northern Gulf had reached that level , including one swath off Texas 's Galveston Bay . While the area of the BP oil spill overlaps some parts of the `` dead zone , '' Rabalais said , `` It would be difficult to link conditions seen this summer with oil from the BP spill in either a positive or negative way .

The operation , aimed at subduing the still unstable deepwater gusher that was provisionally capped in mid-July , is part of a two-pronged strategy that seeks to finally seal the Macondo well later in August through a relief well . The `` static kill '' will take between 33 and 61 hours . `` The aim of these procedures is to assist with the strategy to kill and isolate the well , and will complement the upcoming relief well operation , '' British-based BP said in a statement . Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production , told reporters in a briefing that drilling of the first of two relief wells , seen as the definitive , permanent `` kill '' solution , could resume by Thursday . The relief well should intercept the ruptured Macondo well shaft in mid-August , so that more mud , and cement can be injected to shut it down for good . The full magnitude of the Gulf of Mexico spill , triggered in April by a deadly rig explosion at the BP-owned Macondo well , became apparent on Monday as government scientists released revised figures showing almost 5 million barrels of oil leaked before the well was temporarily capped on July 15 . This made it the world 's largest accidental maritime release of oil , surpassing the 1979 Ixtoc well blowout in Mexico 's Bay of Campeche that gushed almost 3 million barrels . Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who oversees the U.S. oil spill response , said earlier that engineers had succeeded in halting a hydraulic leak found on Monday in the cap that could have hindered the `` static kill '' operation . Allen told reporters engineers were moving cautiously , initially pumping in only a small amount of mud , so as not to damage the fractured well and cause fresh leaks . `` This thing wo n't be truly sealed until those relief wells are done , '' Allen added . The spill has unleashed an environmental and economic catastrophe on the Gulf Coast , disrupting the livelihoods of fishermen and tourism operators and triggering a barrage of damages lawsuits against BP . The company has said it will pay all legitimate claims and clean up fouled beaches and marshes . BP PRESSED OVER INFORMATION DISCLOSURE The new leak estimates spelled further bad news for BP , which also faces an investigation by U.S. securities regulators into whether its employees profited illegally from the spill . The revised flow numbers suggest the company had underestimated costs by at least $ 1 billion . BP had estimated the well had leaked some 4 million barrels of oil and that it would be fined $ 1,100 per barrel under the Clean Water Act . The company faces fines of $ 4,300 per barrel if gross negligence is proven , but said it saw no need to change its provision as a result of the new estimate . BP shares initially fell around 1 percent in early London trading on Tuesday , but recovered to close up 0.62 percent . U.S.-traded BP stock is up roughly 48 percent from its 2010 closing low of $ 26.97 on June 25 . But it is still 34 percent below its April pre-spill high above $ 60 . `` BP has fallen to a point where people are beginning to get their hands around how large this might be and as a result the uncertainty has started to leave the stock and people start buying it back , '' said Shawn Hackett , president at Hackett advisors in Boynton Beach , Florida . But the British energy giant faced fresh accusations on Tuesday that it was seeking to restrict information . The National Wildlife Federation released a letter from nine scientists and marine researchers concerned over reports that BP was requiring confidentiality clauses in research contracts with scientists , which would prevent them from releasing findings for three years . `` BP is mounting a PR campaign suggesting that the environmental damage of the spill is over when we know that they have dumped millions of gallons of toxic dispersants to sink the oil out of sight , turning the Gulf into a toxic chemistry experiment , '' said Jeremy Symons , senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation . The letter , sent to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and incoming BP CEO Robert Dudley , demanded full public disclosure of all scientific data related to the disaster . BP , which took a $ 32.2 billion charge related to the spill in its results last week , has said it will sell $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion of assets to pay for the disaster . On Tuesday , it said it would sell its Colombian oil assets to a consortium of Canada 's Talisman Energy and Colombia 's state-run Ecopetrol for $ 1.9 billion . BP 's 10 percent partner in the well , Japan 's Mitsui , has yet to decide if it will shoulder any costs , helping the trading house to report a 79 percent jump in profits to 102.5 billion yen -LRB- $ 1.18 billion -RRB- . Other oilfield services and drilling companies are counting the costs of a U.S. drilling moratorium and permit delays . But a top official at the U.S. Interior Department on Tuesday said he hoped the ban on deepwater oil drilling could be lifted `` significantly '' ahead of the current November 30 deadline . And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is delaying action on energy legislation that would implement offshore drilling reforms until some time after Congress returns from its summer recess in mid September .

L -RRB- -LRB- BP . N -RRB- spill is gone from the Gulf of Mexico or has degraded into tiny particles , with 26 percent remaining as a sheen or tarballs , buried in sediment or washed ashore , U.S. scientists said on Wednesday . `` At least 50 percent of the oil that was released is now completely gone from the system , and most of the remainder is degrading rapidly or is being removed from the beaches , '' Jane Lubchenco , administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told a White House briefing . A U.S. report released earlier in the day said 74 percent of about 4.9 million barrels released since the April 20 blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig can be accounted for : 25 percent was burned , skimmed or directly recovered from the wellhead , 25 percent naturally evaporated or dissolved and 24 percent was dispersed , either naturally or with chemicals . Even that dispersed oil can leave tiny particles in the water column between the sea floor and the surface , which pose a potential hazard to wildlife , Lubchenco said . A final 26 percent of oil is considered `` residual '' and is less easily categorized . Some is present as a light sheen on the ocean or as tarballs , some may have already washed ashore or been collected , some is buried in sand and sediment . Both the dispersed and residual oil , accounting for nearly half the total , include oil that is in the process of biodegrading . Until it has been totally broken down by natural forces and bacteria into water and carbon dioxide , it still can be dangerous , Lubchenco said . `` Oil that is in microscopic droplets that is still there may be toxic to any of the small creatures under the water that are encountered , '' she said . `` And even in very small droplets , it ... can be toxic . '' `` WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OIL ? '' The U.S. report , titled `` BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Budget : What Happened to the Oil ? '' found 33 percent of the oil was dealt with by government and private cleanup efforts . This 33 percent consisted of 17 percent captured straight from the wellhead , 5 percent by burning , 3 percent by skimming and 8 percent by chemical dispersion . Some environmental experts were skeptical of the government 's presentation . `` It 's troubling that reports are lumping dispersed oil still lurking under the water 's surface with oil that 's been captured , contributing to the sense that the oil that 's been swept under the rug is no longer a problem , '' Dr. Bruce Stein of the National Wildlife Federation said in a statement . `` But scientific evidence shows this oil is far from gone , '' he said , citing signs of oil-and-dispersant mix under shells of blue crab larvae , at the base of the Gulf food chain . The U.S. report was released just before officials from NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency testified at a U.S. Senate hearing about the use of dispersant chemicals to combat the BP spill . Paul Anastas , of EPA 's office of research and development , acknowledged there were `` environmental tradeoffs '' to consider when using dispersants . Anastas told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that dispersants were generally less toxic than oil , cut the risk to shorelines and degraded quickly , in days or weeks . Much is unknown about the impact of oil and dispersants on the Gulf surface and deep down and study is needed now , Edward Overton of Louisiana State University told the committee . `` We certainly need to monitor for the long-term damage , how long will it take species to come back , '' Overton said . Jackie Savitz , a scientist at the marine conservation organization Oceana , discounted short-term EPA studies showing that most dispersant chemicals are less toxic than the oil . `` It 's a 48 - or 96-hour study , '' Savitz told the panel . `` Even if all the dispersant goes away in that period of time and the animal does n't die , that does n't mean that it 's going to survive and grow and flourish and be able to escape predators . '' Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Only time will tell how much damage the oil and dispersants have done to our environment . Do n't be fooled by over zealous news articles . Only time will tell . why does this sound like it was written by BP ? Wow , I 'm so happy that the oil disappeared .

As the final stages of the long-awaited `` kill '' operation moved forward , nagging questions remained about the lasting environmental and economic impact to the U.S. Gulf region from the world 's worst offshore oil accident . More than 100 days after the start of the catastrophic spill that ravaged ecologically sensitive wetlands and lucrative coastal economies , BP said no oil was leaking from the undersea Macondo well and no `` recoverable oil '' was left on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico . BP finished pumping cement on Thursday into the ruptured well one mile below the surface after injections of drilling mud earlier this week subdued the pressure of oil and gas . The wellhead was provisionally capped in mid-July . The so-called `` static kill '' at the top of the well is due to be finished off with a `` bottom kill '' later in August with more mud and cement injected through a relief bore that will be drilled into the well shaft . This relief well is regarded as the final solution to plug the reservoir 13,000 feet beneath the seabed . BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , Doug Suttles , told reporters at a briefing the cement job `` appears to be performing as expected . '' `` All of the indications so far look very encouraging , '' he said in New Orleans . Engineers were pressure-testing the injected cement . Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who heads the oil spill response for President Barack Obama 's administration , said the relief well was scheduled to reach the well shaft below the seabed `` somewhere between August 14th and 15th . '' `` We are unequivocally committed to completing the relief wells , '' Allen said in a conference call . A second , back-up relief well is also being drilled . Asked if BP would sell its rights to the Macondo field , Suttles replied : `` We just have n't thought about that . '' `` Clearly there is lots of oil and gas here and we will have to think about what to do with that at some point , '' he said . The well 's sealing was a relief for both the British energy giant , whose shares and image have taken a beating from the spill , and for Obama 's administration , which has faced criticism over its response and has pledged to help the pollution-struck Gulf Coast recover . BP shares , which have recovered strongly since hitting a 14-year low on June 25 , appeared once again to be buoyed by the news of the progress in plugging the well . They rose more than 2 percent in early London trading before falling back to close up 0.46 percent . In New York , BP shares were up 1.7 percent in late-day trading . Suttles , who had led BP 's overall oil spill response in the Gulf but was now returning to his chief operating officer role in Houston , nevertheless acknowledged the coastal cleanup effort was `` far from finished . '' `` Clearly we feel like its moving to a new phase because we 've been three weeks without new oil flowing into the sea , and we do n't have oil out on the open water anymore . But we still have a lot of work around the shoreline , '' he said . Mike Utsler was appointed to take his place in BP 's Gulf spill response operation . The company has lost over a third of its market value since the April 20 blast that killed 11 workers , sank the Deepwater Horizon rig and triggered the spill . Questions remain about the final total of the cleanup bill and the damage liabilities and possible fines BP will face . `` If chapter one of BP 's corporate nightmare took place largely under sea in the battle to plug the leak , the next chapter in this odyssey is likely to play out in courtrooms and law offices , '' IHS Energy analyst Andrew Neff wrote in a briefing note . BP , which already agreed to a $ 20 billion escrow fund to guarantee cover of economic damage claims , has said it would sell about $ 30 billion in assets to address the costs related to the spill , and this asset selling process has started . `` More assets are expected to be up for grabs as BP shrinks itself to steel the company for a vastly different future than it envisioned back in April , when the firm was reportedly days away from announcing a massive oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico , '' Neff added . Many Gulf Coast residents have seen their fishing and tourism livelihoods devastated by the spill . They and some scientists have expressed skepticism about the government 's assertion this week that around 75 percent of the estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked by the well had either evaporated , dispersed or otherwise been contained . Carol Browner , Obama 's energy and climate change adviser , on Friday defended the government declaration . `` No one is trying to oversell or undersell anything , '' she told a community forum in St. Petersburg , Florida , where local business owners said even the threat of oil washing ashore had been enough to dent their income . There was no actual oil impact on the St. Petersburg part of the Florida coastline . BP was working to produce a Gulf Coast recovery masterplan within six months and hoped to get support for it from federal , state and local government , according to James Lee Witt , a former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and now a crisis management consultant , who has been contracted by BP . Michael Hirshfield , chief scientist with the ocean conservation advocacy group Oceana , said it could be years before experts fully understood the spill 's effects on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem , or on species like the Atlantic bluefin tuna , which spawns in these waters . `` It 's like trying to prove a negative . You have to wait longer for the absence of something , '' he said , as the group prepared to embark on a two-month trip to assess long-term impacts on coral , fish , sharks and other marine life . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . I suspected they would do this , and is it a rather standard compression procedure to assure everything fits into any possible leaks -LRB- such as the annulus -RRB- and the layers of mud , cement , and rock are tightened up . Also it allows the cement sets up quickly . The cement will be quite strong tomorrow and the well may then be officially declared DEAD . I can tell from what I know about oil and gas wells , that this was a success and this well can even NOW be declared totally dead . Tomorrow , they can start removing the BOP to bring it to the surface . Then they will examine it to see what caused the Macondo well failure . They will then know if the problems in the recent past found in the other BOPs of the two relief wells are the very same type problems that caused the Macondo blow out -LRB- due to its BOP problem -RRB- . I suspect there will then be a very clear understanding of this entire problem . BP officials have in recent days hedged about committing to pumping cement down the relief well , saying only that the relief well will be used in some fashion . They may opt to just use the well simply to test whether the reservoir is plugged by checking only the annulus . This is good news , as that procedure will not open into the O&G of the Monster Formation again -- to test the BOP of the relief well -- and allow another blow out up through the faulty BOP the relief well is using . I think Admiral Allen will come to realize that only checking the annulus using the relief well will be a total and complete scientific proof that the present bullhead kill did the KILL job . Hopefully he will be advised by people who understand the O&G science and not by scientists who are trying to learn . Being an old retired O&G man , I know this uneventful procedure had all the necessary parts that are needed to completely seal all the problems . It had the heavy mud , followed by cement then followed by a squeeze job -LRB- that I mentioned in earlier posts should be used -RRB- to forever seal this well . In other words , they did it right , and the well is forever DEAD . Unless of course they drill into the Monster Zone again . BP s Senior Vice President Kent Wells most likely will explain this to Admiral Allen . Then hopefully Allen will agree that to save face , they still use the relief well but only to check the annulus -LRB- without re-opening the Monster Zone -RRB- to then confirm what Kent Wells already knows -LRB- like I do -RRB- . I am glad this sad event is over and hope with a little forethought , and Monday Morning Quarterbacking , that both the Government and the Oil and Gas industry will learn to avoid such events . I personally think that preparedness for events is the best insurance -- and that includes quick cappable BOPs -LRB- in case they fail -- such as the type I suggested to the offshore O&G Governing Agency . Only if Allen says Reopen it . However there will still be some illogical people that think Zombies and Phoenix Birds are real and imagine they might rise again from their graves -RRB- . It is easy to demonize BP for this whole mess , but frankly , compared to most companies I am familiar with , BP even if they bear some responsibility for the initial event , which is still not clear to me , have behaved in a very responsible and proactive manner during the course of this spill . One thing that needs to be carefully examined in this whole incident is the actions of the firefighting boats that were involved in extinguishing the original fire . It appears now that they may have played a significant role in the actual collapse of the rig by the way they sprayed water onto the rig to fight the fire , which apparently may have been the factor that caused the rig to eventually collapse . These last two comment are really lame ... if that is all you expect than you deserve the lame response we were given . If you are to believe the threat of terrorism than the obvious targets should be all the deep sea wells . Obviously there is a huge weak link between The United States coastline , the business that goes in and out of our harbors everyday and these oil wells . Duh ... yeah this response from Obama and BP are acceptable . It is a sad commentary on you if you are patriotic citizens of the U.S. . This discussion is now closed .

Oil caused the mess in the Gulf of Mexico . Should U.S. oil royalties pay for scientists to study what happened , and what 's still happening , to this complex environment ? At least one scientist thinks so . Ed Overton of Louisiana State University figures the billions of dollars collected in royalties by the now-defunct and much-reviled Minerals Management Service -- re-named and re-organized as the Bureau of Ocean Energy -- must have enough money to pay for research into the environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon blowout and spill . Speaking at a Senate hearing last week on the effects of oil-dispersing chemicals , Overton and other experts called the BP spill an unintentional `` grand experiment '' into what deep water oil exploration can do to animals , plants , water and land in the Gulf . As Overton put it , the oil and dispersants are out there now . Best to study them over the months and years ahead to figure out what they 're doing to the environment . `` The Mineral Management Service has generated royalty income to the federal government of billions of dollars . And virtually all of that money has been spent on not understanding the environment , '' Overton said . While it should be the oil industry 's obligation to know how to respond to an environmental disaster like this one , Overton said , `` the government ought to have some oversight in taking some of that royalty money , a significant amount of that royalty money , and understanding how , both from an engineering perspective as well as an ecological perspective , what to do about it . '' There 's plenty that the engineers and ecologists do n't know , Overton said , starting with how to collect oil samples in deep water -LRB- there are sampling techniques to collect plants and animals , but not crude -RRB- . As he told it , when the samplers went down into the Gulf , they got coated with oil , so it was impossible to tell if the oil was just a layer they passed through or whether it was a true sample of what was there at the sea bed . Now that the Macondo well has been capped and a final `` bottom kill '' is seemingly within reach , it 's probably natural for everyone to want to turn the page . But researchers want to actually know what happened . Should oil royalties help pay for that research ?

So , the great oil glutton is seeking compensation for the environmental consequences of the Gulf oil disaster ; a very worthy precedent for future generations who will have to suffer a global catastrophe that will largely be sourced from this gluttony , or maybe the glutton will insist on a professional risk assessment , unlike the Gulf authorities who signally failed to assess the risk arising from drilling a mile under the sea . The federal government should allocate at least 50 % of its Gulf oil spill royalties to pay for continued research of the spill itself . While it would be extremely hard to fix the stupidity of companies willing to employ substandard drilling precautions , a simpler and more effective method of clean up and eradication is out there . Pictures of stagnant brown beaches , innocent animals covered in oil , and entire ecosystems destroyed by the spill should be enough to motivate those in Washington to at least attempt to understand what happened . Oil spills are not a common occurrence , so neither is the research behind them . And for one event to virtually destroy the entire Gulf of Mexico , OUR Gulf of Mexico , for years and years to come , I believe some insight into how an event such as this can be avoided or handled more properly is necessary . Or we can focus on simply compensating those affected and be screwed next time something like this happens .

BIRMINGHAM , Alabama | Fri Aug 13 , 2010 5:03 pm EDT BIRMINGHAM , Alabama -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Alabama is suing BP Plc , Transocean and Halliburton for `` catastrophic harm '' caused by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the state 's attorney general said on Friday . Alabama is the first state to sue BP for damage from the world 's worst offshore oil spill . The decision stems from fear economic victims will be inadequately compensated and BP will shirk its financial responsibility , Attorney General Troy King said . `` We are making this claim because we believe that BP has inflicted catastrophic harm on the state ... We are suing them for the amount it will take to make Alabama whole , '' King told Reuters , declining to specify a figure for damages . BP had no immediate comment , a company spokeswoman said . The suit also named Anadarko Petroleum Corp , among others . Transocean owned the doomed Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that was hired by BP and exploded and sank in April , triggering the oil spill . Halliburton provided the cement work for the well while Anadarko was a minority owner . `` It is believed the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon was a blowout relating to the cementing work , '' the suit said . Alabama 's state government is divided over the lawsuit . Governor Bob Riley said in a statement he opposed the decision on the grounds that it was premature to sue BP before it has a chance to pay claims , especially given that the company has admitted it is responsible . King argued the suit put Alabama in the strongest legal position and said that , while an out of court settlement was possible , the next step was discovery and gathering evidence . The suit accuses BP and the other defendants of `` negligent or wanton failure to adhere to recognized industry standards of care . '' `` The defendants ' conduct in operating the Deepwater Horizon and oil well illustrates their scheme to maximize profits and ignore dangerous risks posed to human health and property , '' it said . Louisiana sustained the most damage to its coastline and waters from the oil spill , which began in April and was plugged with cement on July 15 . Oil also damaged the economies of Mississippi and Florida . The spill has hurt industries including fishing and tourism and has affected other sectors such as housing . People and businesses that have sustained losses can claim against a $ 20 billion BP compensation fund administered by Kenneth Feinberg , named by the White House as an independent overseer . But Feinberg was undermining efforts by Gulf state attorneys general to make it possible for spill victims to claim damages from the fund while retaining the right to sue BP at a future date , King said . At the same time , he said , BP was seeking to evade its responsibility despite a high-profile advertising campaign which states `` we will make this right '' and promises to honor all legitimate claims . Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour in July asked his state 's attorney general not to file a suit against BP to give the federal claims process a chance to work and to allow for a complete assessment of damage to natural resources .

At least 22 miles long , 1.2 miles wide and 650 feet high , the plume was detected more than 3,000 feet beneath the Gulf 's surface during a scientific expedition that ended in late June , the scientists said at a news briefing . It is impossible to say at this point whether the compounds in the plume are toxic to wildlife in the area , but the oceanographers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution said that deep-sea microbes were degrading it relatively slowly , which means it could persist . The fact that the plume exists at all is significant , said Chris Reddy of Woods Hole , who was part of the expedition and co-authored a report about its findings in the journal Science . `` If you asked me -- and I have been studying oil spills for 15 years -- whether or not you would see oil subsurface , I would say no , does n't oil float ? '' `` So this is an important aspect in the basic science world . '' This showed that subsurface oil droplets were not being easily degraded by microbes , as some observers had speculated . Reddy noted the unpredictable nature of underwater microbes . `` Telling a microbe what to do is like trying to push a teenager around , '' he said . `` It is really hard . Sometimes they kick in . Sometimes they do n't ... Microbes are pretty selective in how they eat oil . '' By measuring the specific petroleum hydrocarbons in the plume , the researchers determined that it had to have come from the broken BP Macondo well , and not from oil seeps that come naturally from the sea bottom in the Gulf . NO SIGN OF `` DEAD ZONE '' In June , the scientists observed the plume moving slowly southwest of the blowout , and started tracking it about three miles from the wellhead and out to 22 miles before they were forced from the area by the approach of Hurricane Alex. The plume looked `` like spring water '' and had no visible oil droplets or petroleum smell , the oceanographers said . But it had enough of the hydrocarbons they were sampling to qualify as a subsurface plume . The Woods Hole researchers also found no evidence of a low-oxygen `` dead zone '' in the area of the plume . Their expedition used a robot submarine that was able to detect oil as a bloodhound sniffs a scent , as well as a mass spectrometer that tracks which chemicals are present . The research was supported by the National Science Foundation . The Woods Hole researchers declined to comment specifically about the U.S. government 's August 4 assessment that 50 percent of the oil from the BP spill is gone from the Gulf , with most of the rest rapidly degrading . Nearly three-fourths of the estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil released after the April 20 blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig can be accounted for , according to the government report : 25 percent was burned , skimmed or directly recovered from the wellhead ; 25 percent naturally evaporated or dissolved and 24 percent was dispersed , either naturally or chemically . No oil has leaked into Gulf waters since July 15 , when BP placed a provisional cap over the wellhead . However , the National Wildlife Federation reported in August that cases of wildlife affected by oil , including endangered sea turtles , appear to be increasing . The August 4 report , prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , drew criticism on Thursday from Representative Ed Markey at a hearing on seafood safety . `` I think this report and the way it is being discussed is giving many people a false sense of confidence regarding the state of the Gulf , '' Markey said . `` Overconfidence breeds complacency and complacency is what got us into this situation in the first place . '' Bill Lehr of NOAA told the hearing that all seafood samples from reopened waters or outside the closed area of the Gulf of Mexico have passed sensory and chemical testing for contamination of oil and dispersants .

Hundreds of people filed for an emergency payout with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility after its offices opened in the early morning , fund administrator Kenneth Feinberg told a town hall meeting of fishermen and coastal residents in Biloxi , Mississippi . Feinberg takes over from a BP payments system that disbursed $ 375 million , but he sought to distance himself from that process and from the U.S. government , promising more generous treatment and a faster disposal of claims . `` I do n't care what BP did . I 'm in charge now , '' Feinberg told a meeting in Bay St. Louis for people affected by the spill . `` I do n't care if BP denied your claim . I might find you eligible . It 's a new day . '' Compensation is a heated issue after the leak that began in April when a BP rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sank killing 11 workers and unleashing millions of barrels of oil before it was plugged in July . The decision to submit a claim is voluntary but anyone who provides paperwork in support of a claim would be paid within 48 hours if an individual and within one week if a business , Feinberg said . Many Gulf coast residents have been frustrated by the slow pace of the claims process and skeptical about whether they will get fair and prompt treatment . `` I do n't trust him , '' said Biloxi resident Linda StMartin after attending a town hall meeting . `` I think he is a very honorable man but I think he is boxed in by these very narrow proscribed limitations '' of the fund . BP set up the fund in June under White House pressure to make reparations for losses sustained in the fishing , tourism , housing and other industries in the Gulf coast states of Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . A separate $ 100 million is set aside for losses sustained due to a federal six-month moratorium on new offshore drilling . Feinberg was named compensation czar because of his reputation for fairness acquired administering the September 11 fund and determining executive pay for companies bailed out by the government after the financial crisis . But the spill fund may provide an even tougher challenge , according to insurance experts who said calculating claims for businesses that have lost money is fraught with difficulty . One point of dispute is the length of time during which people can file a claim before they must waive the right to also sue BP . Another is the rules surrounding claims for a final payout , given that the full extent of losses from the spill remains unknown . For the next six months , anyone claiming an emergency payment can also sue BP at a future date . But beyond that period , claimants would forfeit the right to file against the company , Feinberg said . Florida 's Attorney General Bill McCollum issued a statement last week saying the ruling favors BP and weakens provisions advocated by state attorney generals along the coast . `` The current process appears to be even less generous to Floridians than the BP process . Such an outcome is completely unacceptable , '' McCollum said in a statement , echoed by one issued by Alabama 's attorney general . In his defense , Feinberg said the idea for the cut-off point was his rather than BP 's . `` I am beholden to neither the administration nor BP . I am entirely independent , '' Feinberg said . He said no decision had been taken on whether people who claimed after the six-month window would be able to sue other companies such as Transocean and Halliburton who were also involved with the rig .

The micro-organisms were apparently stimulated by the massive oil spill that began in April , and they degraded the hydrocarbons so efficiently that the plume is now undetectable , said Terry Hazen of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . These so-called proteobacteria -- Hazen calls them `` bugs '' -- have adapted to the cold deep water where the big BP plume was observed and are able to biodegrade hydrocarbons much more quickly than expected , without significantly depleting oxygen as most known oil-depleting bacteria do . Oxygen is essential to the survival of commercially important fish and shellfish ; a seasonal low-oxygen `` dead zone '' forms most summers in the Gulf of Mexico , caused by farm chemical run-off that flows down the Mississippi River . Hydrocarbons in the crude oil from the BP spill actually stimulated the new microbes ' ability to degrade them in cold water , Hazen and his colleagues wrote in research published on Tuesday in the journal Science . In part , Hazen said , this is because these new `` bugs '' have adjusted over millions of years to seek out any petroleum they can find at the depths where they live , which coincides with the depth of the previously observed plume , roughly 3000 feet . At that depth , water temperature is approximately 41 degrees F -LRB- 5 degrees C -RRB- . Long before humans drilled for oil , natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico have put out the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill each year , Hazen said . Another factor was the consistency of the oil that came from the Macondo wellhead : light sweet Louisiana crude , an easily digestible substance for bacteria , and it was dispersed into tiny droplets , which also makes it more biodegradable . These latest findings may initially seem to be at odds with a study published last Thursday in Science by researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , which confirmed the existence of the oil plume and said micro-organisms did not seem to be biodegrading it very quickly . However , Hazen and Rich Camilli of Woods Hole both said on Tuesday that the studies complement each other . The Woods Hole team used an autonomous robot submarine and a mass spectrometer to detect the plume , but were forced to leave the area in late June , when Hurricane Alex threatened . At that time , they figured the plume was likely to remain for some time . But that was before the well was capped in mid-July . Hazen said that within two weeks of the capping , the plume could not be detected , but there was a phenomenon called marine snow that indicated microbes had been feasting on hydrocarbons . As of Tuesday , there was no sign of the plume , Hazen said . That does n't mean there is no oil left from the 4.9 million barrels of crude that spilled into the Gulf after the April 20 blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig . The U.S. government estimated on August 4 that 50 percent of the BP oil is gone from the Gulf and the rest is rapidly degrading .

One of several live feeds of the procedure from underwater robots showed a cloudy brown substance coming from the well . Beaudo said the `` trailing brownish material '' was residual drilling mud pumped into the well in earlier operations . A blowout preventer is intended to shut off a well if oil or gas uncontrollably rushes to the top . It failed to do so in the case of the Macondo well . BP will replace the 50-foot -LRB- 15-m -RRB- stack of valves and pipes with a working blowout preventer and then resume drilling a relief well to plug the leak for good , the company said . Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the spill response , said officials are monitoring the slow lifting process . `` We will continue to closely monitor progress as the BOP , which along with the latching device weighs approximately 1 million pounds , is lifted to the surface in the next 24-36 hours , '' Allen said in a statement . The company said earlier on Friday that , weather permitting , BP expects the relief well to intersect the Macondo well near its bottom about 13,000 feet beneath the seabed in mid-September . BP will then pump mud and cement into the well to ensure the leak is dead , the company said . BP and government officials did not expect oil to leak from the well once the failed blowout preventer was lifted off . The company pumped cement into the well from the top on August 5 , which officials believe sealed off the well from the reservoir . The failed blowout preventer is critical evidence in various investigations into the April 20 blowout that led to an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and killed 11 men . Officials removed it before finishing the relief well to preserve its value as evidence and ensure a working blowout preventer was on the well to handle any pressure increases when drilling resumes . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . I could see none -- could you ? Seems all I saw was smokey stuff falling out of the old failed BOP after they raised it -LRB- possibly old residual mud -RRB- . Highlight and paste the picture in your Browser to see this : With no drill pipe showing -- or falling just as they pulled off the BOP ? -- that pipe should NOW be fished out and Cement Bond Logs run to check the lower annulus and the bottom of the well viewed before any opening in the annulus is made . You would not let BP do major surgery on your brain before running some scans and tests . Allen and BP would be total fools not to do expensive `` diagnostic tests '' before opening the annulus -LRB- not knowing what their surgery might find -RRB- . I sure do n't want anyone experimenting on me and operating on me without knowing what is available to study -- and the results of that study . Suppose they fish out this fallen drill pipe and the logs show perfect cement bonding outside the lower casing in the annulus . The entire purpose of the Relief Well is to seal the annulus to prevent hydrocarbons from the Monster Zone below . There would be 5000 feet of rock hard cement in the lower casing that is impossible to leak by and only the annulus could possibly leak something . If they find that annulus cement on the diagnostic test to be perfectly sealed the well is perfectly declared sealed and must be declared forever dead . Why use any experimental surgery to do what already is cured . However if they find weak cement or any place in the lower annulus near the 5000 foot plug in the bottom of the casing , then it must be sealed . At that point there are two possible ways to repair the annulus . Run large tubing with a packer on it so nothing can pass it coming up the casing once it is set -- and set the packer . Then have Haliburton use a wire line through the tubing and through the packer to the spot the diagnostic tests show cement is needed and perforate holes through the pipe into the annulus . The packer protects against anything coming up the casing that might come in from the annulus holes . Then pump a `` cement squeeze job '' into the annulus to repair it -- totally protected by the packer with tubing up to the ship . This is all standard procedure tested by many many years of O&G experience . The let the cement set . Remove the packer and re-log the well to prove it is Killed Forever . Show the logs to Allen and let Haliburton engineers explain this to him and his so called science team . Then officially declare the well -- Killed Twice -- and forever DEAD . Finish the Relief well and run the risk of the identical problem of a liquified methane rising and forming a bubble as it turns to gas and flow over the top of the relief well to re-create this whole mess . Suppose that does not happen and they only open up the annulus to blow out up the annulus where there is no pipe -- creating a blow out impossible to repair . Suppose any one of a miriad of other accidents happen . Dudley admits this is a rate thing to experiment with a Relief Well at this 18,000 foot Depth below 5000 foot of sea water and thinks it should be done to learn about what can be done and whatever new dangers lurk . He seems to think it is a great experiment . Allen wants it because early on he stated that the relief well will be used for the final KILL .

LONDON\\/WASHINGTON | Wed Sep 8 , 2010 9:10 pm EDT LONDON\\/WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc and its Gulf of Mexico oil well partners traded blame on Wednesday after an internal BP investigation tried to downplay the company 's role in the world 's biggest offshore spill . The 193-page BP report offered a preview of how the British oil giant plans to vigorously defend itself against lawsuits arising from the disaster and any charges of gross negligence , which carry fines potentially in excess of $ 20 billion . BP accepted some responsibility for the disaster but pointed the finger at what it said were major failures by Transocean Ltd , the operator of the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon oil rig , and oil services company Halliburton , which cemented the deep-sea well that ruptured on April 20 . The report drew fire from a prominent U.S. lawmaker who accused BP of trying to minimize its role in the disaster . Transocean called it a `` self-serving '' attempt by BP to escape responsibility for its `` fatally flawed '' well design , while Halliburton said the report was filled with inaccuracies . The report threatened to reignite public anger over the massive spill , which caused an environmental catastrophe along the U.S. Gulf Coast , devastated tourism and fishing in the area and damaged President Barack Obama 's popularity . Obama 's spokesman , Robert Gibbs , declined to comment on BP 's findings and said the government was still investigating the disaster to `` find out what went wrong and hold those responsible accountable for the damage that 's been done . '' BP investigators were unable to identify any single action or inaction that caused the Deepwater Horizon rig to blow up on April 20 , killing 11 workers , after the Macondo well ruptured . `` Rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident , '' the report said . `` Multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time . '' Investors had been eagerly awaiting the report to find out whether BP would be able to share the potential costs of the spill -- estimated by some analysts to exceed $ 50 billion . Citigroup analysts said in a research note that BP 's report `` appears to support the case for no negligence , '' but they acknowledged that the findings of the internal investigation were unlikely to be accepted as objective . BP shares trading in New York closed up 3.2 percent , while shares of Transocean were 1.3 percent higher and those of Halliburton were up 1.2 percent . Standard & Poor 's downgraded Transocean 's rating to BBB from BBB-plus , saying the Swiss-based company faced uncertain liabilities arising from the disaster . The U.S. Justice Department could pursue a variety of civil and criminal charges against the companies involved in the spill . Any penalties could be in the billions of dollars . The ruptured well unleashed a torrent of crude that spewed until it was capped three months later on July 15 , after 4.9 million barrels of oil had leaked into the sea . The top U.S. official overseeing the spill response , retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , said on Wednesday that BP may not start the final `` kill '' of its well until mid - to late September . The BP report , overseen by BP 's head of safety , Mark Bly , highlighted eight key failures that led to the blowout of the well and the subsequent explosion aboard the rig . It defended BP 's much-criticized single-casing well design ; the use of fewer-than-recommended centralizers -LRB- devices used to ensure the cement casing is applied evenly around the well -RRB- ; and the decision to replace heavy drilling mud , which was keeping the well under control , with lighter water . `` It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident , '' said BP 's outgoing Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who has faced withering criticism from U.S. lawmakers for initially playing down the scale of the disaster . `` HAPPY TO SLICE UP BLAME '' BP , which has seen almost $ 70 billion wiped off its market value since April 20 , is trying to rehabilitate its tarnished public image and restore investor confidence , spending millions of dollars on positive television and newspaper advertising . `` This report is not BP 's mea culpa , '' said Democratic congressman Edward Markey , an outspoken critic of BP 's handling of the disaster . `` Of their own eight key findings , they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one . BP is happy to slice up blame , as long as they get the smallest piece . '' Energy industry analysts were also not convinced by the BP findings , noting its investigators did not have access to everyone who had been involved in the project . `` Make no mistake , our view remains that this is BP 's well , and BP is in charge of design and execution , '' Houston energy investment boutique Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said in a note . The BP investigation found fault with Transocean employees aboard the rig at the time of the accident . `` Over a 40-minute period , the Transocean rig crew failed to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well , '' BP said . But Transocean said BP was seeking to conceal the key factor that led to the rig explosion -- the well design . `` In both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk , '' it said . Halliburton joined Transocean in rejecting the findings , saying the BP report contained `` substantial omissions and inaccuracies '' and stressed it was fully indemnified for any allegations in the document . In pointing the finger at its contractors , BP said : -- Halliburton had used an `` unstable '' cement mixture that allowed hydrocarbons to leak into the well . -- There was `` no indication '' that Transocean had tested the automatic shut-off function on the blowout preventer before it was used on the Deepwater Horizon rig . -LRB- Blowout preventers are designed to halt all oil and gas flow and contain pressure if there is an uncontrollable gush from a seabed well . -RRB- -- The rig crew diverted the flow of drilling mud and hydrocarbons into the wrong system after the blowout . This meant gas vented onto the rig floor , rather than toward the sea , where it would have been less likely to cause a blast . Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said the blowout preventer was `` inspected , tested and went through a rigorous maintenance schedule prior to being placed on the Macondo well and was then tested weekly , right up until 72 hours prior to the blast . '' `` Any statement to the contrary is false , '' he said . The damaged blowout preventer is key evidence in criminal and civil investigations of the blast . BP retrieved it from the seabed on Saturday under watch of federal investigators and it is being sent to a NASA facility in Louisiana .

The amount of oxygen decreased by 20 percent from the long-term average in areas where oil from the broken BP Macondo wellhead was detected by government and independent observers , scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told reporters . `` All the scientists working in the Gulf have been carefully watching dissolved oxygen levels because excess carbon in the system might lead to a dead zone , '' said NOAA 's Steve Murawski . `` While we saw a decrease in oxygen , we are not seeing a continued downward trend over time . '' Summer dead zones are common in shallower areas of the Gulf of Mexico , caused by run-off from farm chemicals flowing down the Mississippi River . Dead zones have such low oxygen levels that most marine life -- including commercial important fish and shellfish -- can not survive , and scientists feared the BP spill would create such a zone in deep water around the Macondo wellhead after the April 20 blowout at the Deepwater Horizon rig . That did not happen , Murawski said , and at this point is unlikely . He said oxygen levels had hit a `` sweet spot , '' with microbes consuming enough of the dispersed oil to cause what he called a sag in oxygen , but not enough to cause a low-oxygen dead zone . Part of the spilled BP oil was broken up into tiny particles by chemical dispersants , which made it more palatable to petroleum-eating microbes , Murawski said . `` Has it hit a sweet spot ? Was it by design ? The NOAA findings are in line with research presented by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . Both of these institutions published articles in August noting the initial presence of an underwater plume of oil in the Gulf of Mexico and the disappearance of the oil when deep-water microbes efficiently ate it without giving off much oxygen . The ruptured BP well had been secured with no threat of spewing crude . A cap on top of the failed blowout preventer at the Macondo well sealed in all oil flow since July 15 , and on Friday , the company replaced the failed equipment with a new giant stack of valves and pipes . Once the new blowout preventer is tested , BP can resume drilling a relief well that will bore into the Macondo well , pump in mud and cement to plug it for good .

BP 's Gulf of Mexico oil spill has raised concerns globally about the dangers of drilling in ever-deeper waters . North Sea producers are fighting to convince the British government that the UK does not need a moratorium on drilling , like the one imposed in the U.S. by President Barack Obama , pending a review of the cause of the disaster . Norway has halted new offshore projects until the causes of the rig blast that led to the BP oil spill are known . A statement from the Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee on Thursday said Hayward would testify on Wednesday next week and be accompanied by BP 's North Sea boss Bernard Looney and Mark Bly , BP 's head of safety . On Wednesday this week , Bly presented BP 's internal probe into the accident which laid most of the blame for the accident on BP 's contractors , driller Transocean and Halliburton , the company which cemented the well . The companies rejected the accusations . Transocean 's North Sea boss Paul King appeared before the Commons committee on Tuesday and was challenged about a report from the UK safety regulator in which employees alleged they had been pressured not to report safety concerns . While the committee said it would question Hayward about the implications of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill for deepwater drilling in the UK , the agenda did not specifically include plans to discuss the causes of the spill itself .

FTSE said BP would be dropped from FTSE4Good , which many managers of ethical funds use to screen companies before including them in their portfolios , from September 18 , citing a FTSE policy committee . `` The Committee 's decision to remove BP followed consideration of the company 's response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the environmental and social impact and its history of similar incidents , '' FTSE said in a statement . BP was evicted earlier this year from the DJ Sustainability Index . Ethical investors account for an increasing portion of share buyers and , consequently , the decisions could hit demand for BP shares in future . In an interview , FTSE 's director of responsible investment , David Harris , declined to give much more detail about the reasoning of the oversight committee . Generally , companies are reviewed after major accidents or problems , with consideration given to their track records , he said . `` In the case of BP , the committee felt BP did not have an exemplary record and its response to the incident was not exemplary either , '' Harris said . The shares of BP , which declined immediate comment , closed down 0.9 percent at 411.65 pence , lagging a 0.4 percent drop in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . BP said earlier it would delay the release of its third-quarter results by a week because of added accounting complexities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the worst in United States history . The company said its quarterly figures , normally reported on the last Tuesday of the month after the end of a calendar quarter , would now be released on November 2 , rather than October 26 . A spokesman said the decision came after it proved challenging to complete its previous quarterly numbers within the normal timeline and denied it was related to the discovery of any new liabilities . BP released on Wednesday an internal investigation into the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 . The spokesman said the team compiling the report , which laid most of the blame on the companies BP hired to drill the well , had been supported by internal and external lawyers . But he said the lawyers had been `` ring-fenced '' from the rest of BP and denied their role was to frame the report -- much criticized by the contractors and U.S. politicians -- so as to help BP fend off lawsuits . `` Their role was to make sure everything in the report was legally watertight , '' spokesman Andrew Gowers said . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin and Ross Kerber ; editing by David Cowell , David Holmes and Andre Grenon -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Dudley also told the analysts that claims by Gulf states for lost tax revenue related to the spill `` should not be too high '' as any tax drops due to lower economic activity following the spill would be offset by the economic stimulus of the response effort . Citigroup said that , following the meeting with Dudley , it had growing confidence BP would reinstate its dividend early next year . `` Dudley pointed out that the company was not ordered to cut the dividend by the U.S. government - it was a choice by the corporation to preserve liquidity ... we believe the company can re-instate a dividend with the Q4 results , '' Citigroup said .

Cost cuts were not behind the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , and the accident highlighted industry failings rather than flaws particular to BP , Hayward told a UK parliamentary committee on Wednesday `` It 's been easy for some parties to suggest that this is a problem with BP . I emphatically do not believe that that is the case , '' Hayward told the Energy and Climate Change Committee . Hayward denied that there was any underlying link between the Deepwater Horizon rig blast in April , which led to the United States ' worst ever oil spill , and previous safety lapses at BP such as a 2005 refinery blast that killed 15 workers . `` It 's very dangerous to join up dots that may not be appropriate to join up , '' he said . Hayward said rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil criticized the way BP designed and drilled the well because they were motivated to do so by the political climate in the United States at the time . Exxon denied this and said it believed that BP 's choice of well design , the type of cement used -- which BP acknowledged contributed to the rig blast -- and BP 's failure to conduct a common safety check , were key mistakes . `` This was a deviation from standard industry practice , '' a spokesman said . BP capped its blown out well on July 15 and is preparing to seal it permanently . Analysts said they had expected BP to take a tougher legal and public stance against opponents after the well was killed . Britain 's safety regulator released documents on Wednesday that showed it found , just three months before the Gulf of Mexico rig blast , that BP lacked a clear chain of command for dealing with a loss of well control on a North Sea oil rig . Health and Safety Executive -LRB- HSE -RRB- inspectors visiting the Magnus platform 160km northeast of the Shetland Islands in late January discovered there was confusion about who would order a well shut-off in the event of a blow-out . `` Baker Atlas personnel stated that in the event of a well control incident requiring the well to be closed in , that BP would make this decision , '' the HSE said , referring to a unit of oil services provider Baker Hughes . `` The BP well services supervisor expected that Baker Atlas would make this decision , '' the HSE added in the letter to BP . The Deepwater Horizon blast followed a loss of well control and survivors told investigators that there was confusion on board the rig about who was in charge following the incident . The HSE added in one letter that on a BP 's Clair platform there was `` evidence of a culture among your contractors , Seawell -LRB- up to senior levels of management -RRB- , of working outside of procedures , permit or permit conditions . '' BP , whose safety culture has been criticized heavily by U.S. politicians , responded by saying : `` The letter from the HSE last year relates to comments made by a contractor which the safety representatives on the platform strongly felt did not reflect the reality of the platform 's safety culture and practices . '' `` Following further engagement with the HSE the matter was closed , '' BP added . Stavanger-based Seawell 's chairman , Joergen Rasmussen , said he was surprised by the HSE comments . BP also failed to provide adequate safety training to North Sea staff and to conduct adequate oil spill response exercises , the Department of Energy and Climate Change said in separate documents , although the department said the matters had since been addressed . Hayward got less confrontational treatment from the committee than he received from a U.S. congressional committee , which interrogated him for several hours . The committee chairman , Conservative party MP Tim Yeo , quizzed Hayward about whether he had been pressured by the White House into cutting BP 's dividend and whether the U.S. government and media had treated him fairly . President Barack Obama 's popularity in the UK has been hit by what many Britons consider as Washington 's anti-British attacks on BP . Hayward refused to offer a view on whether the criticism he received was fair and denied it was pressure from the White House which forced BP to cut its dividend . Hayward steps down in two weeks to be replaced by Bob Dudley , who is running the oil spill response . Hayward said his own poor image in the U.S. made his position untenable . BP plans to drill in the deep water west of the Shetland islands in 2011 , BP 's North Sea boss , Bernard Looney , said . He said the rig which will likely drill the prospect would have a blow out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- with two shear rams , rather than just one , as the BOP on the Deepwater Horizon rig had . The failure of the BOP to operate and to slice through the drill pipe of the blown-out well is one of a series of failures that BP said caused the disaster .

HOUSTON | Sun Sep 19 , 2010 3:58 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - With a final shot of cement , BP Plc permanently `` killed '' its deep-sea well in the Gulf of Mexico that ruptured in April and unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the top U.S. spill official said on Sunday . Some 153 days after the Macondo well ruptured , the U.S. government confirmed that BP had succeeded in drilling a relief well nearly 18,000 feet below the ocean surface and permanently sealing the well with cement . `` The Macondo 252 well is effectively dead , '' retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who has overseen the U.S. government 's response , said in a statement . `` We can now state , definitively , that the Macondo well poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico . '' President Barack Obama , whose public approval ratings were hurt by public discontent over the U.S. government 's initial response to the spill , welcomed the long-awaited development as an `` important milestone . '' Obama said his administration was now focused on making sure the Gulf Coast `` recovers fully from this disaster . '' `` This road will not be easy , but we will continue to work closely with the people of the Gulf to rebuild their livelihoods and restore the environment that supports them , '' Obama said in a statement . On Thursday , a relief well bored into the bottom of the Macondo well to pump in cement and seal the reservoir for good . BP pumped cement for seven hours on Friday , and finished a pressure test early on Sunday that showed the well was permanently clogged , Allen said . The development provided an anticlimactic end to the disaster nearly five months after the well ruptured on April 20 , causing an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil into the sea . Tony Hayward , BP 's gaffe-prone chief executive who absorbed the brunt of public anger over the spill , called the final plugging `` a significant milestone , '' and reiterated the company 's commitment to cleaning up the mess . The spill marred the coasts of four U.S. Gulf states , prompted a ban on new deepwater drilling and left BP 's image in tatters in the United States , home to 40 percent of the London-based oil giant 's business . The disaster also wiped about $ 70 billion from BP 's market value and spurred BP to replace Hayward with an American , Bob Dudley , effective October 1 . Oil spewed unchecked into the sea from the mile-deep -LRB- 1.6 km deep -RRB- well for 87 straight days until July 15 , when BP engineers sealed it with a cap . By then , the well had gushed more than 16 times as much as the 257,000 barrels of oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 . For the U.S. offshore drilling industry , which is reeling from a deepwater drilling ban imposed by the White House soon after the spill , uncertainty still abounds . Operators in the Gulf -- long considered a haven from the political uncertainties of Venezuela and Russia -- will now have to contend with stricter federal regulations that will make it harder and more expensive to drill . `` There 's clearly a sense that the page has been turned now , '' said Daniel Yergin , oil industry historian and chairman of IHS CERA . `` It 's now the day after for the oil and gas industry in the Gulf . '' In New Orleans , which has seen its tourism and seafood industries hurt by the spill , word of the well 's permanent demise brought little rejoicing . `` I feel like any world citizen would in this crisis -- that it was a threat to the entire world ecology , '' said Carey Beckham , a partner at Beckham Bookshop in the French Quarter . `` I 'm relieved , but the jury 's still out .

As the story as a whole involved so many angles , some of the key turning points to illustrate centered on the progress seen only from the video feeds , from the first view of the leak at the source , to the capping of the well and the first time no oil could be seen gushing from the mechanism . Covering the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster as a still photographer for Reuters has brought unique challenges . Although the volume of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico is huge , relatively small patches of oil have landed along coastal Louisiana . It 's like a monster who hides most of the time and lashes out quickly , withholding its full strength . But it has been important to show that oil is in fact having an ecological impact here , and to find areas with visible proof . On Thursday May 20 , I accompanied a Reuters TV crew , correspondent Mathew Bigg and Maura Wood of the National Wildlife Federation on a boat , looking for heavy concentrations of oil in an area at the very southern tip of Louisiana . We headed for an area which had just begun being inundated with oil from the Deepwater Horizon leak . After hours of searching , a broken propeller , and an unexpected lunch aboard a work barge , we had found the spot . As Wood prepared to take a sample of the water to check its toxicity , I suited up in chest waders and slowly got into the murky water , one camera and lens stuffed into my waiters . Maneuvering in the soft lagoon floor was tricky ; I sank down as I tried to walk and was concerned I might loose my balance and get myself and camera wet . So I held onto the drifting boat long enough to get into position , cautiously letting go so I could have both hands free to shoot . Wood leaned over to get samples and I was able to shoot it from from the perspective of the oily water . It was shortly after midnight on March 24 , 1989 that the Exxon Valdez hit Bligh Reef in Prince Edward Sound and began leaking millions of gallons of North Slope crude oil . I was sound asleep in Toronto , Canada when that happened . Reuters was still taking a feed of pictures from UPI -LRB- United Press International -RRB- from the United States . But I remember hearing the news that morning and packing my gear -LRB- which at that time was film , powder chemicals , portable darkroom , 16S color transmitter and of course . . some cold weather clothing -RRB- . I sat in Toronto as the politics of the news business played out in Washington between Reuters and UPI . Finally , it was decided that we would both cover the story . So , David Ake , a UPI staffer from Denver , and I made our way there . I remember landing in Anchorage , Alaska , and hauling my gear into a rental car at midnight , then driving six hours to Valdez in the dead of night . About 4 hours into the drive I was held up by a few hundred caribou , who decided to cross the two lane highway , they were just mingling so I still have vivid memories of being in the middle of nowhere honking my horn to help speed up the process . I rolled into Valdez at first light and it didn t take long to realize that most of the town s people did not want the media there . The few media that had found rooms at the only hotel in town were all having to checkout as rumor had it that Exxon had bought the hotel . With help from our desk in Washington and the chamber of commerce in Valdez I found a place to stay at the home of the local taxidermist .

As the story as a whole involved so many angles , some of the key turning points to illustrate centered on the progress seen only from the video feeds , from the first view of the leak at the source , to the capping of the well and the first time no oil could be seen gushing from the mechanism . The biggest hurdle faced in capturing images from the multiple video feeds was the ability of the computer used for the task . When opening the BP live video site all of the feeds automatically opened at once , causing some computers to crash . Our iMac was able to handle the multiple video feeds with a few minor hiccups . The video feeds opened in individual QuickTime windows , which recorded the feed over several hours and enabled us to review each video for key images without having to constantly monitor the live feeds . Once a key image was identified , it was captured , converted to jpeg and distributed to our clients worldwide . While reviewing several hours of video from the ROVs in just a few minutes on a daily basis , I became intrigued with the tasks performed by the ROVs and their operators : from sawing off the broken pipe in the first days to installing the capping stack on top of the broken BOP , performing the top kill and the eventually successful static kill , monitoring pressure gauges during certain operations , seeing oil leak , seeing no oil leak , maneuvering of multiple tools and components , all while under extreme pressures and darkness of the formidable depths . The video feeds displayed the exact depth in feet among other things , which changed respectively as the ROV moved about or surfaced for maintenance . Other ROVs could be viewed from the eyes of one as they worked and preformed intricate tasks . The precision with which the submersible robots worked on such a grand scale endeavor was both impressive and exciting to watch . The innovations undertaken in the operations of the ROVs by the containment team resulted in advanced capabilities for ROVs for spill containment , but unfortunately not without a huge cost in lives , livelihoods and to businesses . Illustrating the story from video a mile deep as it unfolded and eventually came to an end gave us another angle to fully document the story , and has advanced our ability to seek new and innovative ways to provide news pictures to the world .

LONDON | Mon Sep 20 , 2010 4:16 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP said payouts to people affected by its Gulf of Mexico oil spill had dramatically increased since it surrendered authority for dispensing funds to an independent administrator . BP said the Gulf Coast Claims Facility -LRB- GCCF -RRB- , the $ 20 billion fund it set up to compensate fishermen , hoteliers and retailers whose business was hit by the spill , had paid out 19,000 claims totaling over $ 240 million . The total cost of the spill response has hit $ 9.5 billion , Europe 's second-largest oil company by market value said in a statement late on Sunday . The GCCF is run by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg , formerly the Obama Administration 's executive pay Czar . BP said on September 3 that the fund had paid out $ 38.5 million since it began operating on August 23 . This represented a rate of around $ 3.5 million per day , broadly in line with the rate at which BP had previously been disbursing funds . Since September 3 , the amount of money being paid out has risen to an average of over $ 12.5 million . Just over a week ago , Bob Dudley , who will take over as BP 's Chief Executive on October 1 , told analysts that he expected the $ 20 billion fund to more than cover the total valid claims for compensation . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin ; Editing by Will Waterman -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

NEW YORK | Wed Sep 22 , 2010 9:59 am BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will have little or no effect on the medium-term outlook for offshore drilling and supplies , the International Energy Agency told Reuters on Tuesday . Fatih Birol , the chief economist of the group that advises 28 industrialized economies , said while some projects may be delayed in the short-term , the need to increase future oil supplies meant governments will not impose draconian regulations in the wake of the BP -LRB- BP . L -RRB- spill that caused the United States ' worst ever oil spill . `` From what I 'm hearing from most OECD governments is that they are considering increasing regulation and those that are put in place will be monitored more closely than they perhaps were in the past , '' Birol told Reuters in a telephone interview . `` But they are sensitive to the fact these regulations should not be designed to slow the growth of offshore drilling or making these upstream investments unprofitable . There may be some delays to some project , but I do not think the BP oil spill will represent the end of offshore drilling . '' The Obama administration put a six-month ban on deepwater drilling in place following the massive oil spill at BP 's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico in April . The government is currently working on a report offering recommendations on possibly lifting the moratorium , which could be completed by the end of the month . Birol said there was little evidence oil prices between $ 70 and $ 80 a barrel -- the range they have traded in for most of the last three months -- were damaging the economy , but he warned producing countries it would be dangerous for them to try and push prices higher . `` We do not have the evidence to say if prices around $ 75 are hurting the economic recovery for now , but if it goes above $ 80 a barrel it will be a definite risk to growth in some OECD countries and may even strangle the recovery before it really gets underway , '' Birol said . `` Between $ 75 and $ 80 , we have ample spare production and spare capacity . If oil prices go to $ 100 , this will send a clear signal to oil importing countries that they need to speed up conservation efforts . Birol was speaking to Reuters ahead of a press briefing at the United Nations in New York on Tuesday evening where he will present with the IEA executive director , Nobuo Tanaka , a report on steps needed to end energy poverty in the developing world . Birol said conservation and substitution efforts have become more difficult as the vast majority of oil demand growth over the past five years has come in the transportation sector where there are few viable alternatives for now . Additionally , most growth has been centred in countries such as China , India and those in the Middle East , where oil products are subsidised so consumers do not feel the full impact of rising prices . A surge in oil prices back to $ 100 could change that , however , he said . `` While most growth in oil demand over the last five years has been in the transportation sector - for which there are no viable alternatives for now -- the U.S. , UK , Germany , China and Japan are all increasing support for the move towards electric cars , '' Birol said . `` If the price goes to $ 100 , these efforts will accelerate . That would not be good news for oil exporters .

David Boies , a New York litigator , is entering a crowded field of plaintiffs ' lawyers also angling for a prime role in the lawsuits against BP Plc and other corporate defendants . He has submitted an application for a seat on a committee that will oversee the cases , according to court documents .

In August , many of these cases were consolidated in a federal court in New Orleans . Judge Carl Barbier asked the lawyers who have brought lawsuits to submit applications for a seat on the committee . A seat comes with the power to generate fee work for years and gives the attorneys the ability to shape the direction of the case . The judge overseeing the case said he will consider an applicant 's willingness to commit to years of legal work , ability to work with others and experience in complex litigation . Boies , chairman of law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner , championed Gore 's case in the Bush v Gore U.S. Supreme Court case in 2000 that catapulted George W. Bush to the White House .

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus , who drew up a Gulf Coast recovery plan at the direction of President Barack Obama , said Congress should dedicate `` a significant amount '' of penalties levied on BP under the Clean Water Act to restoring a region that suffered economic and environmental damage from the spill . Mabus did not make clear what proportion of the BP fines should be dedicated to the recovery effort and how much money it would involve . BP faces potentially billions of dollars in fines from the spill , which began in April and was plugged in July . Meanwhile , a U.S. Department of Justice official denied that it was in settlement talks with the British energy giant after a U.S. congressman told reporters the two parties were in negotiations over spill fines . Republican U.S. Representative Steve Scalise had told reporters in New Orleans that he understood that negotiations were ongoing between BP and the Justice Department that could lead to a settlement or , if they failed , to a protracted court case . In a report , Mabus also recommended that Congress create a federal Gulf Coast Recovery Council to oversee the funds that would be set aside for Gulf Coast recovery . Funds should go toward repairing damage to water and wetlands , to economic recovery , to tourism and seafood marketing and promotion , and to improving the health and mental health of people affected by the disaster , Mabus said . `` Congress has to come up with a number , '' he said . Environmental groups praised the recommendations made by Mabus , a former governor of Mississippi , one of the states affected by the spill . `` Secretary Mabus is doing his part to fulfill President Obama 's promise to create a long-term plan to restore the Gulf Coast and make it better than it was before the BP oil disaster , '' said a joint statement from groups including the Environmental Defense Fund , the National Audubon Society and the National Wildlife Federation . The latest government estimate on how much oil spilled from the ruptured well off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico is more than 4 million barrels . That could mean a fine of more than $ 17 billion if the government seeks the maximum penalty against BP . In another development , the seven-member White House commission that is developing recommendations on the future of offshore energy drilling accused companies involved in the spill of failing to cooperate fully with its inquiry . The panel lacks subpoena power to force companies such as BP and Transocean Ltd to provide information . A Transocean spokesman said the company `` has been and will continue to be responsive to the Commission and other federal entities investigating the Macondo well incident . '' The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation giving the commission subpoena authority but the measure has languished in the partisan gridlock of the U.S. Senate .

I believe the answer lies in individual states making elections non-partisan . The top vote-getters in the primary square off for the general election . This would keep Republicans from going far right to get elected and Democrats from going far left . With the current system it is no wonder that the result is gridlock in Congress . The parties can still exist and promote their candidates , but the result would allow more mainstream candidates to get elected . BP is already liable under law for Gulf restoration costs and the proposed use of civil and criminal fines for that purpose is effectively a kickback to BP . The fines should be placed in a special adjunct fund to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to be distributed for improvement of oil spill response technology , create effective Area Response Plans and to create baseline ecological studies of our coastal and inland waterways . Right now , our skimming systems recover 200 times less than advertized , our Area Response Plans are ineffective and we do n't even know how ecological systems may be irreparably damaged by spills , dispersants and air pollution from burning oil .

Earlier this month , three Mexican states sued British oil giant BP and its contractors Transocean , as well as affiliated businesses . The northern state of Tamaulipas -- which shares a border with Texas -- and Veracruz with its long coastline on the Gulf of Mexico , both said the spill posed risks to beaches and marine life that would cause lost profits and potentially large clean-up bills . Quintana Roo on the Yucatan Peninsula , home to major tourist destinations like Cancun , also filed suit in a Texas court on September 15 . `` We expect the rest of the -LRB- Mexican -RRB- Gulf states will join the endeavor and potentially ... Mexico , '' said lawyer Enrique Serna , whose San Antonio-based practice represents the states . The lawsuits are believed to be the first by foreign governments against the petroleum giant BP and its contractors in the aftermath of April 's Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and ensuing oil spill , Serna said . More than 300 civil lawsuits have already been filed in the United States by out-of-work rig workers , fishermen and hotel workers , and that number is expected to increase . Mexico 's federal government has been studying the viability of a legal claim against BP , the environment minister told Reuters in an interview in June , adding that the remnants of the oil spill could hit Mexico 's shores next month . As of August , the government of Mexico had spent about $ 35 million monitoring the spill , according to media reports . `` It is only natural for them to sue BP and the rest of the corporate defendants to reclaim such sums , '' Serna said . `` There are a number of damages that eventually we 'll be able to quantify but only time will tell , '' he said . Serna said he also expects more than 1,500 individual claimants in Mexico -- from fishermen to restaurant operators who have been forced to pay more for fish from Pacific waters -- to eventually press claims . A spokeswoman for Halliburton said the allegations appeared to be without merit , but BP and Transocean declined to comment . BP has set up a $ 20 billion fund to compensate those who lost livelihoods or income due to the spill , but it excludes foreign claimants . The company has paid out over $ 240 million thus far and has said it will add to the size of the fund if necessary .

LONDON | Wed Sep 29 , 2010 12:21 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc 's incoming Chief Executive Bob Dudley has ousted the oil group 's exploration and production chief following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and promised to restructure the company to boost safety . Echoing a move BP made after the Texas City blast in 2005 , Dudley also said on Wednesday he was appointing a new safety guru , Mark Bly , who would ensure safe practices across the organization . BP shares closed up 3.9 percent at 421 pence , against a 0.2 percent drop in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . Andy Inglis , the head of its upstream Exploration and Production , becomes BP 's second senior executive casualty of the spill following Dudley 's replacement of Tony Hayward , who enraged U.S. public opinion during the crisis with his gaffes . The blown-out well came under the remit of Inglis 's unit , and BP insiders have predicted his departure for months . He will leave at the end of the year with a year 's salary of 690,000 pounds -LRB- $ 1.1 million -RRB- in lieu of notice and will retain his pension pot valued at 6 million . Bly 's role will be stronger than previous safety chiefs , a BP spokesman said , because he will have representatives in each business unit that will have the authority to intervene if they feel practices are not meeting BP 's safety standards . BP said it was also reviewing its system of incentives , which critics have said encouraged managers to put profits and cost-cutting ahead of safety . `` We will refine the checks and balances at all levels ... I want us to sharpen our everyday attitude to operational and technical risk -- to ensure it is the norm for people on the frontline to speak up about risk and for managers to listen , '' Dudley said in an email to staff seen by Reuters . `` There is a pressing need to rebuild trust in BP around the world , '' Dudley added . Neither in the official or internal statements did Dudley admit that safety failings particular to BP played a role in the oil spill . Instead , he repeated BP 's position that the disaster highlighted industry shortcomings -- a line of argument which has enraged BP 's rivals , who accuse the London-based company of having a weak focus on safety and technical excellence . Analysts said investors would be encouraged that Dudley appeared to be willing to take bold steps and that BP was increasing its focus on safety . `` It plays well to the U.S. government and to investors who worried that BP had not been as safety conscious as some of its rivals , although we have to see more detail to know how it will work , '' said Iain Armstrong , oil analyst at Brewin Dolphin . A blowout in April at BP 's Macondo well caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 men and unleashed America 's worst ever oil spill . Fears about the final bill for the disaster , along with concerns that BP 's battered image in the United States could make it hard for the company to exploit its assets there , have wiped around $ 60 billion off the company 's stock market value . Europe 's second-largest oil company by market value said it was also splitting up its core upstream division into three units : exploration , project development and production , with the aim of fostering technical expertise . Inglis said in an email to staff seen by Reuters that the change would be implemented over the next month . BP 's internal probe into the disaster revealed its main representative on the drilling rig , and possibly his colleagues onshore in Houston whom he may have consulted , were unable to correctly read a basic safety test , thus missing an opportunity to avoid the blast . BP has laid most of the blame on its contractors , but rivals said BP 's own account of the disaster showed its practices fell short of industry standards . Dudley will expand the top management team to include Bly , the heads of the three upstream units , and a new head of strategy and integration . Evgeny Solovyov , oil analyst at Societe Generale , said there was a risk that the additional safety oversight and top management positions could slow down decision-making at the company . `` I am concerned that BP might become too bureaucratic , '' he said , though he agreed it was crucial for BP to send a message that it was taking safety more seriously if it wanted to preserve its U.S. growth hopes . `` BP is in image rebuilding mode , '' Solovyov said . -LRB- Editing by Dan Lalor , David Holmes and Will Waterman -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Oregon State University -LRB- OSU -RRB- researchers found sharply heightened levels of chemicals including carcinogens in the waters off the coast of Louisiana in August , the last sampling date , even after BP successfully capped its runaway Gulf well in mid-July . Near Grand Isle , Louisiana , the team discovered that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -LRB- PAHs -RRB- -- which include carcinogens and chemicals that pose various risks to human health -- remained at levels 40 times higher than before the area was affected by the oil spill . The compounds may enter the food chain through organisms like plankton or fish , a researcher said . `` In a natural environment a 40-fold increase is huge , '' said Oregon State toxicologist Kim Anderson , who led the research . `` We do n't usually see that at other contamination sites . '' The PAH chemicals , which are often linked to oil spills , are most concentrated in the area near the Louisiana Coast , but levels have also jumped 2 to 3 fold in other spill-affected areas off Alabama , Mississippi and Florida , Anderson said . As of last month , PAH levels remained near those discovered while the oil spill was still flowing heavily , Anderson said . The team will continue to sample for chemicals in months to come . Although BP has sealed its well , experts are still cataloging the environmental and health hazards left in the wake of the spill . Scores of research teams , including Anderson 's , are working with Federal Superfund grants to measure how the spill affected the environment . Also on Thursday , Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva told Reuters he would press for a congressional investigation into whether estimates of the oil spill volume and its related environmental risks were misrepresented in a federal report from early August . BP 's ill-fated Macondo well spilled a total of up to 4.9 million barrels before it was capped , the report said . But it also suggested that most of the oil had been dispersed naturally or removed by clean-up efforts at the time . Grijalva , who chairs a subcommittee that oversees some wetlands damaged by the spill , said it was unclear whether the Federal report was peer-reviewed and whether its estimates remain accurate . `` I do n't want to let BP off the hook , and my suspicion is that the numbers may be wrong and that the oil is still a danger , '' Grijalva said in an interview .

The oil major on Friday said it would channel revenue from a number of its fields in the Gulf , including Thunder Horse , Atlantis and Mad Dog , into its compensation fund . `` It 's quite a clever thing that BP 's done which is , here are our deep water Gulf of Mexico assets , and we 're pledging overriding royalties as collateral which should suggest to the U.S. administration not to in any way meddle with these facilities , '' said Seymour Pierce analyst Alan Sinclair . There have been concerns that the U.S. could ban BP from future drilling after lawmakers in July voted to pass an amendment to a bill that would prevent BP from acquiring new exploration leases after the blow-out at its Macondo well in April . A BP spokesman declined to comment on whether the move means the U.S. government has told BP , or the company expects , it will not be banned from future drilling . Shares in BP gained 2.9 percent to 440 pence at 7:02 a.m. EDT on Friday , their highest level since early June , outperforming Britain 's blue-chip index , which was up 0.6 percent and slightly ahead of the European index of oil and gas companies which was up 2 percent . Another analyst , who did not wish to be named , noted that BP is planning to sell $ 30 billion of assets and said the deal between Chinese refiner Sinopec and Spanish oil major Repsol , announced earlier could be driving market optimism on asset prices . `` Repsol 's got a very good price for some of its assets today so maybe people are getting hopeful on that , '' he said . BP also said on Friday that the total bill for fighting the spill and compensating victims hit $ 11.2 billion by September 29 , rising from $ 9.5 billion on September 18 . The pledging of the assets is in line with the terms of the fund set out in August , when BP agreed to give the fund first priority to some oil revenues to finance its $ 5 billion contribution this year and the $ 1.25 billion every quarter from 2011 to 2013 . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . The US Government wont ' let them drill , making the Gulf leases worthless . Pledge the assets of the now worthless leases against the claims funds . BP gets to write off the worthless leases against earnings , and does n't end up paying the claims because the `` assets '' of those leases are pledge against them . Score - BP : 1 , US Government : 0 Ah , the US government . Never a better group of Telfon Warriors have I seen . When things are going bad in the US , look for the nearest foreign government or business to blame . Take China and the Yuan as the latest in a long series of perfect pass off 's . @bobw111 : your type continues to annoy me . If BP wanted to ` avoid ' paying anything , they could do so very easily . BP 's US business is seperate from the rest of the Group . Therefore , if the Group -LRB- yes , the Group being the British owned , operated and managed entity -RRB- wanted to , they could quite simply stop funding the US business and leave it to fund and fight for itself from its own assets . It is a simple thing that every large corporation does -- it is called a Corporate Veil and it seperates business units , allowing Groups to 's eperate ' business units that it may need to . Therefore your comments are completely inane . If BP wanted to , it would be too easy for them to not sell any assets and leave the US business to fund the entire GOM situation from the revenue of their assets . This would obviously lead to bankruptcy of the US business which employes over 30,000 American 's and is owned primarily by American 's as it is listed on the NYSE .

The $ 650 million international census , by 2,700 experts in 80 nations , discovered creatures such as a hairy-clawed `` yeti crab , '' luminous fish in the sunless depths , a shrimp thought extinct in Jurassic times and a 7-meter -LRB- 23 ft -RRB- long squid . But the project -LRB- www.coml.org -RRB- , which reckoned most types of creatures dodged the census and were still to be found , also documented overfishing of cod or tuna , hazards from oil and other pollution and impacts of global warming . `` The news about the oceans is both very good and very bad , '' said Paul Snelgrove , of Memorial University in Canada , who compiled the final report of a census that found more life than expected from the Arctic Ocean to volcanic vents on the seabed . It raised the estimate of known marine animals and plants bigger than microbes , from worms to blue whales , to nearly 250,000 from 230,000 . And it estimated that far more , or 750,000 other species , were still to be found . Scientists said the biggest gaps were in still unexplored tracts of the Arctic , Antarctic and eastern Pacific oceans . And much of the deep ocean floor had barely been sampled . `` There is an enormous opportunity , '' said Jesse Ausubel , a co-founder of the census and program director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation . `` There are three species out there to be discovered for every one we know . '' The census itself found more than 6,000 potentially new species , led in numbers by crustaceans and molluscs , and made formal descriptions of more than 1,200 of them . Among extremes , scientists found a meter-long tube worm an estimated 600 years old , tracked a sooty shearwater bird flying 64,000 km -LRB- 40,000 miles -RRB- in the longest known annual migration and recorded a sailfish swimming at 110 kph -LRB- 69 mph -RRB- . Among spinoffs , a 2009 review of the Gulf of Mexico found 8,332 species from fish to mammals in the area hit by BP 's deep water blowout in April 2010 , the worst spill in U.S. history . `` It 's become one of the most valuable potential contributions of the census , '' Ausubel said of the Gulf survey . Checking the state of the Gulf against the public database would help understand damage -- and costs of BP 's cleanup . Two members of a five-strong commission named by U.S. President Barack Obama to investigate the spill - Terry Garcia and Donald Boesch -- had worked on the census . In the longer term , monitoring the seas may help understand threats such as climate change and a related acidification of the oceans . Examination of the makeup of some of the creatures and plants might yield medical breakthroughs . A related project had created a `` barcode of life , '' inspired by the black and white lines on products in supermarkets , that allows scientists to identify species with a quick genetic test . That has already exposed mislabeling of sushi in New York City and could have wide economic impact in tracking fraud in fish exports . And the scientists said the census had successfully focused public attention on the beauty and variety of marine life and could help rally efforts to safeguard the seas . Artists have been inspired by some creatures -- images of the yeti crab , found off Easter Island , has even been emblazoned on skateboards , Snelgrove said . `` These critters are tremendous ambassadors for us , '' he added .

The start date for the non-jury trial , which is likely to be a centerpiece of the litigation , is a delay of four months from what the judge last month indicated was acceptable start date . The lawsuits , which have been consolidated in a federal court in New Orleans , stem from the April explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers and set of the worst spill in U.S. history . The 2012 trial will address who is to blame for the spill , and what portion of blame they will bare . The trial will not assess damages . The trial will address whether Transocean can limit its liability under admiralty law to the value of the sunken oil rig , or about $ 25 million . In setting the date , the judge cited the need to complete testing on the blow-out preventer and the time it will gather evidence relating to the device , which is a key part of understanding the explosion . At a hearing in September , lawyers representing injured workers and families bringing wrongful death claims pushed for a much quicker schedule for starting the trial .

The revelations from the National Oil Spill Commission , whose members were appointed by President Barack Obama , could be embarrassing as Obama 's Democratic Party struggles to retain control of the U.S. Congress in the elections on November 2 . The commission said that after the rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers , the government was too optimistic about the British oil company 's ability to bring the ruptured well under control . `` For the first ten days of the spill , it appears that a sense of over-optimism affected responders . Responders almost uniformly noted that , while they understood that they were facing a major spill , they believed that BP would get the well under control , '' the commission wrote . It said : `` Though some of the command structure was put in place very quickly , in other respects the mobilization of resources to combat the spill seemed to lag . '' Large sections of the Gulf of Mexico were closed to fishing , hundreds of miles of shoreline were polluted and the coastal economy , including tourism and fisheries , was disrupted before the well was capped on July 15 after the worst offshore oil leak in U.S. history . The commission also criticized the White House for blocking early worst case estimates of the oil spill , which it said may have affected how fast resources were assembled to fight it . The panel said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- wanted to release some of its worst-case spill models on the accident in late April or early May . But the White House Office of Management and Budget -LRB- OMB -RRB- blocked the move to make the information public . The White House decision to block the estimates came as BP was being criticized for failing to provide accurate information on the amount of oil that was leaking . In a joint statement , the directors of OMB and NOAA did not deny that NOAA 's early spill estimate was blocked . Instead , they said NOAA 's early analysis was incomplete because it did not take into account the measures to control the oil , like using floating booms , skimming the oil and burning it at sea . However , those measures would not have stopped the oil from spewing out of BP 's broken well . The agency heads noted that other senior government officials told the public in early May what the worst-case flow rate could be . Commission staff said it established that the possibility of releasing the worst-case discharge figures was at least discussed at the government 's Unified Command level that oversaw efforts to plug the well and clean up the oil . The panel said in the end government teams and independent scientists came up with the same approximate figure on the total amount of oil that spilled from the well -- roughly 5 million barrels of oil leaked , with 4.2 million barrels pouring into Gulf waters and the rest being recovered . However , commission staff questioned comments made by Carol Browner , the White House 's energy and climate change director , after the well was plugged that `` more than three-quarters of the oil is gone . '' The panel said about 40 percent of the oil that spilled and was labeled as `` dissolved '' and `` dispersed '' was potentially being biodegraded , but was not `` gone . '' `` Dispersed or dissolved oil may still be present in the water , and even evaporated oil remains in the atmosphere for a short time , '' the commission said . The panel also said the government went overboard in placing boom to stop the oil , especially in Louisiana , where directions went out to `` keep the parishes happy . '' As a result boom was placed everywhere , including in passes where fast tidal currents made it ineffective , and in places where it was unlikely to encounter any oil . Boom was also put in environmentally sensitive areas such as marshes , where severe storms blew it onto delicate grasses and habitat . `` The boom wars never reached a resolution . In many instances , responders knew that in deploying boom they were responding to the politics of the spill rather than the spill itself , '' the commission said . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Doggett ; Editing by Russell Blinch and David Storey -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

BP 's oil spill is expected to rack up an over $ 30 billion bill for shutting the leak , cleaning up the oil and compensating those affected . This has prompted concerns about what would have happened if a company without BP 's massive resources had been operating the blown-out well .

Some analysts have predicted that the oil spill could cause a shakeout with smaller companies being forced to sell up because new regulations force them to seek insurance cover which may be either unobtainable or unaffordable . In the wake of Exxon 's Valdez oil spill , companies formed a $ 1 billion fund to pay for future oil spills . Farnsworth , a former BP executive , said he expected the new fund to be bigger . Cobalt 's market capitalization has dropped by $ 1.5 billion , or 30 percent , since the oil spill began , Farnsworth said . The CEO added that he expected it would take a long time for drilling to resume in the Gulf of Mexico even if a drilling moratorium , installed in the wake of the oil spill , is lifted in November , as expected . `` The real moratorium ends when they start issuing permits again and that could take a long time , '' he said .

The committee will coordinate the activities of the 15-member plaintiffs ' steering committee that was also appointed on Friday by Judge Carl Barbier . Hundreds of lawsuits have been brought by fishermen , restaurant owners , hotels and injured workers stemming from the April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which set off the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . A federal judicial panel sent most of the spill-related lawsuits from around the country to Barbier , a federal judge based in New Orleans . The executive panel is made up of Jim Roy and Steve Herman , Louisiana lawyers who had already have been acting as the plaintiffs ' co-liaison counsel , which can be a largely administrative role coordinating with the court . Joining them will be Texas attorney Scott Summy of the Baron and Budd law firm based in Dallas and Brian Barr of Levin Papantonio Thomas Mitchell Rafferty & Proctor , which is based in Pensacola , Florida . The 15-member steering committee includes Elizabeth Cabraser , a California attorney who led the fight against Exxon over the company 's Valdez spill in Alaska . She is also playing a lead role in lawsuits against Toyota Motor Corp over claims its cars raced out of control . The committee also includes Mike Espy , the Agriculture Secretary for former U.S. President Bill Clinton . Espy is now a Mississippi lawyer . A seat on the committee gives the lawyer the power to shape the direction of the case as well as command a larger slice of the settlement . Attorneys left off the committee essentially lose control of the lawsuits they have filed against BP and others . More than 100 attorneys applied for the steering committee , and several notable applicants were excluded . David Boies , who represented Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case that decided the disputed 2000 presidential election , was not appointed . Nor were heavyweights among plaintiffs attorneys such as Mark Lanier , a Texas attorney , or Joseph Rice of the Motley Rice law firm in South Carolina . The steering committee also excluded a group of mostly Texas attorneys who dubbed themselves the `` Deepwater Horizon Casualty Coalition '' that represented most of the workers who were injured or killed in the rig explosion . The coalition clashed with other plaintiffs ' attorneys by pushing for an aggressive schedule that included trials on key issues in March .

Peter Voser told the Oil and Money conference in London on Tuesday that to correctly investigate the accident one had to examine the thinking behind the particular well design BP used -- something BP 's report did not consider . The Macondo well design included a number of cheaper options , including the use of a single tube from the surface to the reservoir , rather than two overlapping tubes , and U.S. lawmakers said these choices reflected a tendency on BP 's part to put profits before safety . `` Shell clearly would have drilled this well in a different way and would have had more options to prevent the accident , '' Voser said , referring to Shell 's preference to include more barriers to hydrocarbon leaks in its well designs . The chief executive of driller Noble Corp , who was speaking at the same conference , also challenged BP 's claim that the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- on the rig failed , and alleged that the failure to correctly read the well was the real cause of the accident . The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in April after an uncontrolled surge of oil and gas went up the well . the sinking of the rig led to the worst oil spill in United States history . BP has blamed the failure of the BOP , a stack of valves designed to cut off well flows in the event of a high-pressure surge , and human errors , largely on the part of its contractors , for the rig blast . But Noble 's chief executive David Williams said the cause of the blast was not the BOP . `` It was caused by a failure of the individuals involved to identify what the well was telling them , '' he told the conference , referring to the fact that rig staff did not shut in the well despite rising pressure and other warning signs . He said the BOP may not have even failed at all , given speculation that pieces of piping were found inside the device . If this came from dislodged piping in the well , it could also call BP 's well design into question . Bernard Duroc-Danner , chief executive of oil services company Weatherford said it was a mistake to rely on BOPs to avert disasters . `` BOPs should be , in many ways , redundant , '' he told the conference . BP has come under fire from rivals who have suffered heavy losses due to the drilling ban imposed by President Barack Obama in the wake of the oil spill . Nonetheless , Voser accepted that Shell and others had not invested enough in developing solutions to clean up spills . `` The industry was not prepared to handle this spill , '' he said . Voser said he expected tighter regulation following the spill and that in future Shell would be more selective about who it would partner with on projects in the Gulf of Mexico . Shell 's CEO also said that his company was making progress in Iraq , where it won a contract to develop the Majnoon field last year .

OPA is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 . BP has already paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to fisherman , retailers , charter boat captains and property owners who suffered from the spill , the largest in U.S. history . The company has publicly committed to pay clean-up costs and all `` legitimate claims , '' rather than applying the cap . Under pressure from the Obama administration , the company also has established a $ 20 billion compensation fund , but a slew of lawsuits also have been brought against the company and its business partners . At a court hearing on the lawsuits on Friday , BP created confusion about its stance on the liability cap . It did not commit to waiving the cap at the hearing , as many plaintiffs ' attorneys had expected , and said in a statement on Friday that the cap `` is not relevant . '' `` BP lawyers would n't say on the record they would waive the cap , '' said Steve Herman , a Louisiana attorney who is leading the hundreds of lawsuits against BP and its partners . `` It certainly took everyone by surprise . '' In Monday 's court filing , BP said it would waive the liability cap . BP also urged other defendants in the case , including rig owner Transocean Holdings LLC , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC , also to waive the liability cap , according to the filing . BP also said it reserved the right to seek reimbursement from the other defendants and denied engaging in grossly negligent conduct , which would open the door to potentially huge punitive damages .

L -RRB- Chief Executive Bob Dudley has stepped up his battle to rebuild the troubled oil giant 's reputation , declaring safety is so core to the group that it would be the sole measure for staff bonuses in the last quarter of this year . Dudley needs to restore investor confidence in the oil group following its Gulf of Mexico oil spill and other disasters in recent years , and to fend off threats to BP 's ability to operate in the United States . Some U.S. lawmakers have argued the oil spill , a refinery blast in 2005 , and Alaskan oil spills in 2006 , reflect a corporate culture that encouraged managers to put profits before safety . Dudley disputes this claim and to emphasize BP 's commitment to safety he told staff in an email , seen by Reuters , that : `` The sole criterion for performance reward for our operating businesses in the fourth quarter of 2010 will be performance in safety , compliance , silent running and operational risk management . '' `` We are taking this step in order to be absolutely clear that safety , compliance and operational risk management is BP 's number one priority , well ahead of all other priorities , '' he added in the email which was sent on Monday . A BP spokesman confirmed the email 's contents . Last month , ahead of his official October 1 start date , Dudley said he was reviewing BP 's system of incentives , to ensure that employees never to feel pressured or tempted to sacrifice safety for other goals . The spokesman said this review would be concluded early next year and that the fourth-quarter bonus move was aimed at instilling a stronger safety culture in BP as soon as possible . He denied it was a publicity stunt . Rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc -LRB- RDSa . L -RRB- has long linked staff bonuses to safety , while Exxon Mobil -LRB- XOM .

With 40 percent of its assets located in the U.S. , such a move could cripple the company . Analysts said that in addition to reassuring investors that another disaster was not around the corner , Dudley 's prime task was to preserve BP 's U.S. position .

The suit is one of thousands of damages cases to stem from the spill from BP 's blown-out undersea Macondo well , which between April and July dumped millions of gallons of oil into the sea , fouling coastlines in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . The well was capped in mid-July . But while the bulk of the cases have been brought by affected individuals , like fishermen , hoteliers and companies , this one brought by conservation groups focuses on endangered sea turtles , whales , birds and Florida manatees . The case was filed in federal court in Louisiana six months after the DeepWater Horizon rig explosion that triggered the spill . It says that these species were harmed by the leaked oil but also that oil in the ocean continues to do them harm . `` The harmful effects of the BP oil well blowout on endangered and threatened wildlife will continue for many years , '' said Gregory Buppert , attorney for Defenders of Wildlife , one of the plaintiffs in the case . `` We ask the court to compel BP to provide the resources necessary to ensure -LRB- that -RRB- imperiled species in the Gulf recover from this disaster , '' said Buppert , whose organization filed the suit along with the Southern Environmental Law Center -LRB- SELC -RRB- , the Gulf Restoration Network and the Save the Manatee Club . Since harm to the species can not immediately be remedied , the plaintiffs would like BP to set up a fund to help Gulf wildlife as a whole , said SELC lawyer Catherine Wannamaker . The suit did not estimate a total value for the fund . But some environmental experts say proving continuing and ongoing harm -- as opposed to simply past harm -- will not be easy for the specific species described in the suit , paving the way for a legal battle . BP has consistently said it will consider all legitimate claims for damages related to the spill . The disaster spawned a plethora of lawsuits against BP and partner companies involved in drilling the Macondo well . Gulf Coast fishermen , hoteliers and others who sustained economic losses through the spill have filed suits because their losses stemmed from environmental damage . One remedy for this group is the $ 20 billion compensation facility set up by BP and administered by Kenneth Feinberg but victims can also sue BP and many of those cases are consolidated into a multi-district litigation suit in New Orleans . The Gulf Coast Claims Facility administered by Feinberg has paid $ 1.45 billion in claims since it took over the claims process from the company on August 23 . A second group of suits was filed by states and the federal government over harm to their natural resources . Louisiana sustained the most damage and could eventually receive billions of dollars in compensation , according to one environmental lawyer . Lawyers have also filed suits over the terms under which the government has issued permits to oil companies , including six cases filed in federal court by the environmental group Earthjustice , said David Guest , a lawyer with the group . The suits challenge permits issued by the government 's former Minerals Management Service bureau that waived requirements of oil companies to disclose plans in the event of a worst case scenario or a requirement to say how they would deal with the failure of a blowout preventer . This preventer mechanism is designed to avert catastrophic blowouts of wells . Since the spill , the bureau has been renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement . The effect of the Earthjustice suit and others will be to sharpen scrutiny on government handling of drilling permits , said Adam Babich , director of the environmental law clinic at Tulane University . Before the spill , `` the environmental community was not paying as much attention as they should have . If there are no challenges to government action ... the government gets lazy , '' he said . The case is Defenders of Wildlife et al v. BP P.L.C. et al , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana as case no. 2:10 - CV-03879 . The suit lists John Timothy Suttles of the Southern Environmental Law Center in Chapel Hill , North Carolina as the attorney for the three animal defense organizations . -LRB- Reporting by Matt Bigg ; Additional reporting by Jeff Roberts of Reuters Legal -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1850", "dct": "2010-10-22", "dates": ["2010-07-22", "2010-10-22", "2010-10-22", "2009-01-01", "2010-06-01", "2010-07-15", "2010-09-19"], "text": "Greenpeace activists place a banner with the British Petroleum -LRB- BP -RRB- Logo in a protest against the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico at the Austrian BP headquarters in Wiener Neustadt July 22 , 2010 .

L -RRB- Gulf of Mexico oil spill meant it missed out on an industry-wide trend of higher profits and rising production in the third quarter , according to a Reuters poll . BP 's third-quarter replacement cost profit was forecast down 2 percent to $ 4.60 billion -LRB- 2.9 billion pounds -RRB- despite a 12 percent rise in crude prices , a 29 percent hike in U.S. natural gas prices and a doubling in British gas prices , the poll found .

Industry No. 1 Exxon Mobil -LRB- XOM . N -RRB- was forecast to post a 53 percent rise in net income to $ 7.26 billion , while U.S. rival Chevron 's -LRB- CVX . N -RRB- net income was seen up 15 percent to $ 4.41 billion . Replacement cost and CCS earnings exclude unrealised gains or charges related to changes in inventory values and , as such , are comparable with net income under U.S. accounting rules . `` The focus will be on the ongoing implications of the Macondo disaster but it will be very important to see that underlying operating and financial performance remains competitive , '' analysts at UBS said in a research note . BP took a $ 32 billion charge in the second quarter to account for the likely costs of the oil spill -- the worst ever in the United States . However , analysts do not believe that was the end of the matter . Barclays Capital analysts expected BP to increase the provision for the oil spill by $ 2-3 billion because it took BP over a month longer to seal the well , for good , than it thought . Also , the analysts polled said they expected BP 's oil and gas production would likely drop , on average , by 3 percent in the quarter because the oil spill response effort sapped resources from its other fields in the Gulf of Mexico . Across the sector , Barclays predicted a 4 percent rise compared to the 2009 period , and Exxon 's output was seen up 19 percent to 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day -LRB- boed -RRB- , largely thanks to its June acquisition of XTO Energy . A brighter spot for BP may come in refining . All the big , integrated oil companies should receive a boost from higher average margins globally . However , the gains were uneven , with margins in the United States , where BP 's facilities are mainly based , jumping almost 30 percent , while margins in Europe , where Shell and Exxon have more capacity , were flat . With the oil well plugged on July 15 and killed for good on September 19 , it was inevitable the spill would impact the quarter 's results -- whose release has been delayed by a week due to additional work needed to account for the disaster . BP investors are now looking for clues in the results statements and teleconferences with management as to how fast new chief executive Bob Dudley can turn the oil major around . `` The path to rehabilitation post Macondo and Bob Dudley 's new strategic direction are the key to performance rather than Q3 earnings , '' analysts at Citigroup said in a research note .

Last week , the company agreed to sell a package of oil and gas fields in Vietnam and Venezuela to its Russian joint venture TNK-BP for $ 1.8 billion . BP and Marubeni Corp said on Monday that Japan 's fifth-largest trading house would buy BP 's interests in the Magnolia , Merganser , Nansen and Zia fields , representing output of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of oil and gas . The interests are part of a package of largely non-producing Gulf of Mexico assets , mainly focused on what is known as the Paleogene play , where the major Kaskida discovery was made , that BP agreed to buy from Devon Energy in March . A BP spokesman said the interests in the mature fields being sold to Marubeni would have been sold even if BP had not had its oil spill . `` When BP acquired Devon 's Gulf of Mexico assets it was clear that these four fields did not fit well with the rest of our business in the region , '' Andy Hopwood , vice president for Strategy and Integration , said in a statement .

The comments by Bob Dudley represented the latest volley in BP 's battle to rebuild its battered reputation by taking a harder line with those who have blamed the disaster on a safety culture at BP that , they said , put cost-saving before safety . However , the remarks also prompted angry reaction from one U.S. lawmaker who said the company continued to be in denial about its responsibilities and called on Dudley to testify before congress . In an address to the annual conference of British business lobby group , the CBI , Dudley said there had been : `` A great rush to judgment by a fair number of observers before the full facts could possibly be known , even from some in our industry . `` I watched graphic projections of oil swirling around the gulf , around Florida , across and around Bermuda to England -- these appeared authoritative and inevitable . The public fear was everywhere , '' he said . BP said in late July that Dudley would take over as chief executive on October 1 , succeeding Tony Hayward who had come under fire for his public gaffes , including playing down the extent of the disaster , which inflamed public opinion . Dudley 's comments on Monday echoed those he made early in the 87-day crisis during a television interview , when he said scientists who argued the well was gushing up to 70,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- were `` scaremongering . '' At the time , Dudley said the `` best estimate '' of the flow rate was 5,000 bpd . A government panel later put the flow rate at 62,000 bpd . BP 's rivals including Chevron , Exxon Mobil , and Royal Dutch Shell , have said they would not have drilled the blown-out well the way BP did . The companies have also rankled at BP 's argument that the disaster highlighted failures in the industry , rather than flaws specific to BP . However , BP 's own internal report into the disaster placed the blame largely on the contractors BP hired to drill and cement the well . Congressman Ed Markey slammed Dudley 's comments . `` BP is continuing to point the finger at everyone but themselves . Since this disaster began , BP has stood for `` Blame Passed ' , '' he said in an emailed statement . Markey said Dudley had refused a request to address a congressional hearing to discuss the spill and asked him to reconsider . Dudley also thanked the British government for its `` stalwart support '' in the face of harsh attacks from U.S. lawmakers during the crisis . `` At the height of the crisis it made a big difference knowing we had such good friends at home , '' the U.S.-born Dudley said .

Halliburton 's shares tumbled as much as 16 percent after the National Oil Spill Commission released a letter detailing the panel 's findings , before recovering to close down nearly 8 percent at $ 31.68 per share on the New York Stock Exchange . BP 's U.S.-listed shares closed up 1.3 percent at $ 40.60 per share . While not absolving BP of responsibility , the report heaped criticism on Halliburton 's cement job , raising investor concerns it could be forced to bear some of the clean-up costs . BP has taken a $ 32.2 billion earnings charge to cover the cleanup . The cost to insure Halliburton 's debt jumped on the news . Halliburton had run a series of tests that showed the material was unstable in the weeks before the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers and spurred a temporary ban on deepwater U.S. drilling . In an emailed statement , Halliburton said it is reviewing the report and will publish a response later on Thursday . A BP spokesman declined to comment . Both Halliburton and BP were aware of flaws in the cement slurry , similar to the one used to seal the mile-deep Macondo well , as early as March 8 , over a month before the spill , `` but neither acted upon that data , '' according to National Oil Spill Commission chief counsel Fred Bartlit . `` The fact that BP and Halliburton knew this cement job could fail only solidifies their liability and responsibility for this disaster , '' said Rep. Edward Markey , a Democratic lawmaker who has criticized BP and its well partners . The industry has developed tests to identify faulty cement jobs in offshore wells , but `` BP and\\/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well , '' Bartlit wrote . Tests conducted by industry cement experts show `` the foam cement used at Macondo was unstable , '' Bartlit wrote in a letter to co-chairs Bob Graham and Bill Reilly . `` Halliburton -LRB- and perhaps BP -RRB- should have considered redesigning the foam slurry before pumping it at the Macondo well . '' The report supports claims by BP that it shares the responsibility for the disaster with its Macondo partners , including Swiss-based Transocean Ltd , which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig . In an interim report BP issued in September , it said Halliburton used an `` unstable '' cement mixture that allowed hydrocarbons to flow up the drill pipe and onto the floor of the rig , where they ignited . The resulting spill marred the coasts of four U.S. Gulf states , prompted a ban on new deepwater drilling and left BP 's image in tatters in the United States , home to 40 percent of the London-based oil giant 's business .

Lawyers for the government and spill victims gained ammunition after the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill said Halliburton knew of , but did not address , flaws in the cement used in the doomed well before the April 20 disaster . While Houston-based Halliburton might face less overall liability than BP and rig owner Transocean Ltd , its shares slid 8 percent on Thursday following the report 's release , wiping out $ 2.5 billion of market value . `` The report shines a harsher light on Halliburton 's role , '' said David Uhlmann , a University of Michigan Law School professor and former chief of the Justice Department 's environmental crimes section . `` Halliburton had a much smaller role than BP or Transocean , but is likely to face at the very least penalties of hundreds of millions of dollars , and possibly as much as $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion , '' he said . `` This is also good evidence for any plaintiffs pursuing civil lawsuits against Halliburton . '' Halliburton defended its actions Thursday , saying that `` significant differences between its internal cement tests and the Commission 's test results may be due to differences in the cement materials tested . '' BP had hired Halliburton to perform cementing operations to seal the well . Halliburton has argued that BP bears responsibility for having failed to test the integrity of the cement job . The findings might nonetheless increase Halliburton 's relative share of the blame for the disaster , which killed 11 workers and is expected to result in tens of billions of dollars in federal penalties . BP has set up a $ 20 billion fund overseen by former Obama administration executive pay czar Kenneth Feinberg to pay victims including fishermen , restaurants and resort owners . Several hundred spill-related lawsuits remain pending in state and federal courts , mainly in states bordering the Gulf . `` The report indicates that Halliburton bears a larger share of responsibility , '' said Robert Gordon , a partner at Weitz & Luxenberg PC in New York who represents 500 commercial fishermen , hotels , and other spill-related clients . `` This is additional evidence demonstrating Halliburton 's callous disregard for safety of workers on the rig , and those who rely on Gulf waters for their livelihoods , '' he added . More evidence about the quality of the cement may surface after the New Orleans federal judge overseeing much of the oil spill litigation signed an order releasing cement that had been subpoenaed by federal investigators . `` No destructive testing on the cementing components will be conducted without further order of the court , '' Judge Carl Barbier wrote in his order , released on Friday . J. David Anderson , an analyst at JPMorgan , had not foreseen significant liability for Halliburton , but said `` that may change '' if Thursday 's commission report has wide impact . `` Importantly , BP chose the cement , tested it , and then signed off on it , '' he wrote in a research report . `` According to the contract with BP , Halliburton is indemnified even in the case of gross negligence . Then again , that does n't preclude the Department of Justice from pursuing criminal indictments . '' Mary Wood , a University of Oregon law professor and director of the school 's environmental and natural resources law program , said Halliburton would be vulnerable if its activities rose to the level of negligence . `` A company could be held negligent if it did not act as a reasonable person would , '' she said . `` BP is responsible for natural resource damages regardless of fault . But if I were Halliburton 's lawyers , I would consider this -LRB- report -RRB- very bad news indeed . '' Halliburton could ultimately face criminal charges under the Clean Water Act , along with BP and Transocean , as well as civil penalties , said Uhlmann of the University of Michigan . But he said liability to victims could be limited , depending on how many chose to tap the $ 20 billion victims fund . `` They might be better off going to the fund , where money will be available within several months , rather than litigate , where money may not be available , if at all , for several years .

Stripping out one-off costs , including an additional $ 7.7 billion charge related to capping the blown-out well , BP said underlying results rose 18 percent , compared to the same period in 2009 , to $ 5.53 billion . This was well ahead of an average forecast $ 4.60 billion from a Reuters poll of seven analysts , although it lagged an 88 percent rise in underlying profits at rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc and a 55 percent rise in net income at Exxon Mobil , the largest western oil major by market value . The outperformance was due to a big drop in the effective tax rate and strong performance from BP 's refining unit . The results , upbeat comments about lifting investments next year and comments suggesting the oil giant could reinstate its dividend in 2011 lifted its shares . These were up 1.2 percent to 430 pence at 1400 GMT , against a 1.0 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . `` A lot of the uncertainty is out of the way , and it is slowly but surely getting back to business , '' Manoj Ladwa , senior trader at ETX Capital , said . However , some analysts said the result was not necessarily a harbinger of better things as the tax rate would likely revert toward normal levels and BP itself said it would be hard to repeat the strong profits from the refining unit . `` The underlying beat is therefore of low quality , '' Oswald Clint , oil analyst at Bernstein said in a research note . BP and its rivals benefited from a 12 percent rise in crude prices in the quarter , compared to a year earlier , a 29 percent hike in U.S. natural gas prices and a doubling in British gas prices . Higher output in the quarter also helped lift BP 's peers but the London-based oil company said its production fell 4 percent , compared to July to September 2009 , to 3.76 million barrels of oil equivalent per day -LRB- boepd -RRB- , due partly to dislocation related to the oil spill . Chief Executive Bob Dudley signaled it could be some time before BP returns to strong growth in the Gulf of Mexico , saying the company would hold back from submitting applications to drill new wells until well into 2011 at the earliest . BP said replacement cost net profit , which strips out unrealized gains related to changes in the value of inventories , and is comparable with net income under U.S. GAAP , fell 63 percent to $ 1.85 billion . Analysts had expected BP to register an extra charge related to the oil spill , the worst in U.S. history , after delays in capping the well for good , but most had predicted a figure of around $ 2-3 billion . The final cost of the oil spill could be far larger , or smaller , than the $ 40 billion charge BP has taken . Anadarko Petroleum and Japan 's Mitsui own 35 percent of the blown out well and they are contractually obliged to share the costs . However , they are claiming that this obligation is void because BP was grossly negligent . Accounting rules require BP to ignore any recoverable payments that are not certain so it is possible that the partners do , in the end , pay up to 35 percent of the total cost . However , if gross negligence is proven , then BP will face the entire $ 40 billion bill alone , and will face additional federal fines . Analysts at JP Morgan said if gross negligence is found , the final cost to BP could be $ 69 billion . BP shares are down 34 percent since before the spill , representing a loss in market capitalization of over $ 60 billion . BP said it would consider whether to reinstate its dividend payments -- canceled in the wake of the oil spill after a political outcry in the United States -- in early 2011 and highlighted the strength of its cash flow . Gordon Gray at Collins Stewart said he expected the dividend to be reinstated for the fourth quarter , at half the previous level , or 7 cents\\/share . Emphasizing the optimistic tone in the results statement , BP said that the strength of its cash flows would allow it to raise its 2011 capital expenditure budget above the $ 18 billion it previously indicated . -LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin ; editing by Louise Heavens -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

They found evidence of the chemicals as deep as 3,300 feet and as far away as 8 miles in May , and said the spread likely worsened as more oil spilled . The chemicals , called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs , can kill animals right away in high enough concentrations and can cause cancer over time . `` From the time that these observations were made , there was an extensive release of additional oil and dispersants at the site . Therefore , the effects on the deep sea ecosystem may be considerably more severe than supported by the observations reported here , '' the researchers wrote in the journal Geophysical Research Letters . The Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig exploded in April , killing 11 workers and spilling about 4.9 million barrels or 185 million gallons of crude oil . Terry Wade of Texas A&M University , Steven Lohrenz of the University of Southern Mississippi and Stennis Space Center and colleagues began testing the waters around the spill soon afterwards . Environmental experts were most worried about the PAHs because they are so toxic , but not much was known about how long they could last in the water or how long it would take them to dissipate . The initial tests showed they were at high levels very deep under the water , the report shows . `` Based on our findings , subsurface exposure to PAH resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil release was likely to be associated with acute toxicity effects in discrete depth layers between 1,000 and 1,400 meters in the region southwest of the wellhead site and extending at least as far as 13 km , '' the research team wrote . PAHs include a group of compounds , and different types were at different depths , they said . It is possible they dissipate quickly , but no one has yet showed this , they added . `` Our findings suggest that toxicity effects of the subsurface PAH compounds could have extended at least as far as 13 km from the wellhead site , '' the researchers said . In September a team at Oregon State University said they found alarming levels of PAHs in the region , 40 times higher than before the area was affected by the oil spill . Last week , the Food and Drug Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said testing had helped confirm that chemicals used to disperse oil from the BP spill have not made their way into fish , crabs , shrimp or oysters from the Gulf of Mexico . -LRB- Reporting by Maggie Fox ; Editing by Jerry Norton -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

It has shown up in independent tests of seafood in the Florida -- just today local news stations reported 50 % of shrimp tested positive for dispersant . 40 % of the ingredients -LRB- by volume -RRB- of Corexit are proprietary secrets , so the government ca n't test for those and we have no idea how toxic they might be . Any `` de-greaser '' , which is what dispersant is , has chemicals that can break apart oil molecules -- they also easily enter animal membranes and bring oil particles and other toxic , carcinogenic chemicals into the fish . One can not extrapolate from a test of one out of hundreds of chemicals to `` chemicals used to disperse oil from the BP spill have not made their way into fish ... '' The government did find trace elements of DOSS in a few samples .

Though the worst U.S. offshore oil spill has ravaged BP 's reputation and its stock price , BP will likely remain a top operator in the Gulf , a region which is key to future U.S. and global energy supplies . More than six months after BP 's Macondo well ruptured and caused more than 4 million barrels of oil to spew into the sea , BP 's attention turns to scouring the oil-soaked shoreline and salvaging an image that has taken a beating from furious Gulf Coast residents and politicians . BP faces a barrage of civil and likely criminal prosecution from the U.S. government and hundreds of injured rig workers , but is unlikely to abandon the Gulf . That 's because the U.S. government needs deep-pocketed energy companies like BP that can foot the soaring cost of drilling there , and BP needs access to the region 's reserves , which are some of the most profitable in its portfolio . BP 's new chief executive , American-born Bob Dudley , must defend his company 's turf in North America , home to nearly half of its global assets and its biggest earnings driver . `` I can promise you that I did not become chief executive of BP in order to walk away from the U.S. , '' Dudley said on October 25 in a defiant speech which criticized the media and industry rivals of stoking fears . `` BP will not be quitting America . '' In its quarterly earnings statement on November 2 , BP raised its estimated cleanup costs by $ 7.7 billion to $ 40 billion . `` The path to rehabilitation post Macondo and Bob Dudley 's new strategic direction are the key to performance rather than Q3 earnings , '' analysts at Citigroup Global Markets said . Institutional investors say BP can shoulder cleanup costs and the added expense of new offshore regulations . But BP must convince sometimes skeptical officials that disasters like Macondo are in the past . `` Bob Dudley 's first priority is reestablishing BP 's credibility with the U.S. government and with various regulators so that BP can continue to operate in the Gulf of Mexico , '' said Will Riley , co-manager of the Guinness Global Energy Fund , which includes BP . In the darkest days of the spill , U.S. politicians and even President Barack Obama referred to BP as `` British Petroleum , '' the now-defunct name the company carried from the 1950s until it merged with U.S.-based Amoco in 1998 to become BP Amoco , and then BP Plc in 2001 . But BP is as American as apple pie -- or almost . After striking a major find in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay field in 1969 , BP grew its market share to be a top producer in the United States , for years the biggest global energy user until China supplanted it this year . Since the Amoco acquisition , `` BP is inextricably bound to the US energy industry , '' said Christopher Wheaton , portfolio manager at Allianz RCM Energy Fund , which owns BP shares . In an era when U.S. politicians demonize foreign oil and extol the virtues of energy independence , BP plays a vital role as one of the biggest producers of home-grown U.S. crude oil and natural gas . BP is the biggest Gulf producer , accounting for about a quarter of the oil and natural gas output from a region that generates about a third of total U.S. domestic production . `` It 's not oil that Obama can turn his back on , '' Riley said . It would also be hard for BP to walk away from the deepwater Gulf , which yields some of the most profitable barrels that it produces . As a whole , the United States accounts for about 25 percent of BP 's upstream production , and about a third of its upstream profits , according to Citigroup . As a result of several asset sales meant to generate cash to cover spill liabilities , BP 's reliance on Gulf operations will only rise . BP does n't have too many other expansion options apart from the Gulf , said Gary Adams , U.S. oil and gas leader at Deloitte , a consultancy . And major oil companies like BP , Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell will likely become more dominant in the deep waters of the Gulf . That 's because they will be the only ones with enough money to cover new liability rules for deepwater drilling , which are likely to require companies to put up billions of dollars of collateral to cover potential future spill costs . For a mid-sized independent like Apache Corp or Newfield Exploration Co , `` a $ 10 billion liability risk is a ` bet the company ' situation , and clearly that will discourage activity , '' Wheaton said . To be sure , BP faces a barrage of civil and likely criminal prosecution from the U.S. government and hundreds of injured rig workers , and accusations from Macondo well partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp. of gross negligence in drilling the well , a claim that BP protests . `` It would clear the air enormously if BP could reach some agreement on the issue of gross negligence , '' said Ivor Pether , fund manager for Royal London Asset Management , which owns BP stock . A gross negligence finding could carry a $ 17.5 billion fine . After the Macondo disaster wiped about $ 70 billion from BP 's market value and forced it to temporarily suspend dividend payments , BP 's institutional investors see the company as undervalued versus other big oil companies . `` We ultimately come back to the numbers , which point to the fact that BP is cheap , '' Riley said . And even environmentalists concede that BP is in the Gulf to stay . `` BP is not going to be hounded out of the Gulf , '' said Elgie Holstein , a senior director at the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund . `` The reserves are too important .

During his one term the Buzzards Bay oil spill happened during April 2003 . On April 27 , 2003 , eight years ago the Bouchard Barge B-120 hit an obstacle in Buzzards Bay , creating a 12-foot rupture in its hull and discharging an estimated 100,000 gallons of No. 6 oil . The oil is known to have affected an estimated 90 miles of shoreline , killed 450 numerous bird species , and recreational use of the bay , such as shell fishing and boating . Since the 2003 oil spill the US Coast Guard has appealed the 2004 Massachusetts Oil Spill Prevention Act and one Massachusetts property damage lawsuit has dragged on for eight years . Republican Mitt Romney is laying the groundwork for a possible White House campaign in 2012 , hiring a team of staff members and consultants . If this informed analysis , I recommend Old Moore 's Almanack . The Gulf may be critical the the USA , but it is far from critical to BP . An important area for exploration and extraction , certainly , but nowhere near a majority of BP 's global business . BP would thrive and make good money from its world-wide operations and proven reserves , without its Gulf fields , if necessary . All of which Obama would have done well to find out before he launched his anti-BP PR campaign while the company was struggling to shut off Macondo and could have done with some support . Especially as it had instantly publicly committed to doing right by the fishing industry and Gulfside communities . Some reward for being a good corporate citizen ! And what 's all this nonsense about `` hundreds of injured rig workers '' ? We have had the tragedy of eleven dead on Deepwater Horizon . I would not be surprised by a few more injuries and burns , but `` hundreds '' ? Not in any report I 've read . Trash reporting which gives the media the bad name they thoroughly deserve . And , by the way , even Exxon would have a job making an offer for BP now . As well as its profitable world-wide operations , BP owns over 18 billion barrels of proven reserves throughout the world . That 's worth a bit more than even Exxon 's ready to pay . This discussion is now closed . We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication .

Bartlit said the panel agreed with about 90 percent of the findings of BP 's internal investigation of the accident released this summer . BP 's report assigned much of the blame for the accident to its drilling partners . Bartlit also said BP 's well design was not inherently faulty , although it did have some impact on the drilling project 's operations . While the commission has no legal authority to carry out policies or punishment , the findings could help BP 's tarnished reputation , although the panel was still very critical of BP 's procedures to plug the well prior to the explosion , saying the oil giant took unnecessary risks . Some lawmakers and critics have accused BP and other companies involved in drilling the well of sacrificing safety for monetary savings in the run-up to the rig explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf over the summer . `` What is fully evident , from BP 's pipeline spill in Alaska and the Texas city refinery disaster , to the Deepwater Horizon well failure , is that BP has a long and sordid history of cutting costs and pushing the limits in search of higher profits , '' U.S. Representative Edward Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts , said in a statement . Bartlit said the commission 's preliminary investigation found no evidence that individual workers took safety risks to save money , and that it instead found that a series of factors ultimately contributed to the explosion . Still , Bartlit emphasized that his probe did not focus on company culture and not everything done on the rig was safe . Workers for BP and Transocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig , also misread a critical negative pressure test of cement used in an attempt to plug the well . The panel 's investigators said workers may have misinterpreted the test because neither of the companies nor the government had standard procedures for handling negative pressure tests . There is disagreement over whether Transocean had any responsibility for overseeing the negative pressure test . `` Industry standard is that the operator , BP , interprets the test , '' Bill Ambrose , director of special projects for Transocean , told the panel . `` Our personnel do not have the experience or authority to interpret the negative test . '' Bartlit released a stinging report last month that said Halliburton Co used flawed cement in BP 's doomed well . Commission co-chair Bill Reilly , former head of the Environmental Protection Agency , said the initial findings seem to point to human mistakes as the primary cause of the accident . While the panel will consider the need for better monitoring of rig data and more standards for negative pressure tests , Reilly said `` it was very difficult ... to see what we could recommend be required that would have avoided the decisions that were made . '' `` However , it 's very difficult for me to conclude that there was not a culture of complacency affecting everything involved with this exercise , '' Reilly said . On Monday , Halliburton 's shares were up 4.7 pct , while Transocean 's shares were up 4.8 pct . BP was off 1.3 percent . Anadarko Petroleum Corp , 25 percent owner of the Macondo well , was down 4.3 percent . Offshore drilling analyst Longdley Zephirin , of the Zephirin Group , said the offshore drilling industry , and especially Transocean and the service companies came off well after the first day of proceedings . `` We believe the hearing shines a positive light in the sector , as it exhibits the importance of safety versus saving money , '' he said . As he presented the commission 's preliminary findings , Bartlit stressed the probe was not focused on legal liability or assigning blame . BP has accused Halliburton of using an unstable cement design and said Transocean failed to test the automatic shut-off function on the blowout preventer before it was used on the rig . Transocean has denied those charges and said BP 's well design was a key factor in the accident . Halliburton has also defended its cement work on the well , and blamed other actions for causing the explosion . It will be difficult to work out the discrepancies between the companies without the legal power to compel testimony from company representatives under oath , Bartlit said . `` I ca n't subpoena people . I wish I could , '' Bartlit said . `` I think it 's damn important . '' Although a measure providing the panel with subpoena power passed the House of Representatives earlier this year , the measure was held up by partisan gridlock in the Senate . President Barack Obama created the seven-member commission in the aftermath of the drilling accident . Its ultimate charge is to develop proposals to prevent and respond to major spills in the future . -LRB- Editing by David Gregorio , Jim Marshall and Sofina Mirza-Reid -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The government led a `` lackadaisical '' response and the White House was guilty of `` political posturing '' over the spill , said Jindal , a conservative and the nation 's first Indian-American governor . Jindal 's name has come up as a possible candidate for the Republican party 's presidential nomination in 2012 . The 256-page `` Leadership and Crisis '' , which is part autobiography and part conservative manifesto , contains a long chapter on the spill with behind-the-scenes detail and singles out the federal government for criticism . `` The White House seemed to focus on the wrong things . I felt like we needed to be on a wartime footing against the oil , and the president was wondering , why is everybody criticizing me , '' Jindal said . Millions of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico between April and July after a BP rig exploded and sank . The spill , which made headlines for months , damaged the environment and economy of coastal states including Louisiana . It also forced the White House to fend off accusations by Jindal , other coastal governors and local leaders that it was moving too slowly to cap the well and provide equipment needed to contain the flow of oil and prevent damage to coastlines . Jindal has built his reputation on his ability as a crisis manager who could better the performance of his predecessor during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , and his frequent press conferences during the spill boosted his national profile . `` You would think following the withering criticism of President -LRB- George W. -RRB- Bush during Hurricane Katrina that the federal response this time would have been swift and sure ... You would have thought that a White House so concerned about its image would have been all over this , '' he said . The book , published on Monday , contains conversations that cast Obama in an unflattering light . Jindal said Obama was furious with him the first time he flew to Louisiana after the spill began because of a letter requesting food stamps for workers impacted by the disaster . Obama quietly scolded him while then chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , cursed Jindal 's chief of staff . A second meeting went no better because Obama was upset about televised criticism . `` He was concerned about looking bad because of the letter . '' ` Careful , ' he said to me , ` this is going to get bad for everyone , ' '' Jindal said , describing the scene as `` almost surreal '' .

Interim findings from the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council attribute the massive spill to workers ' decisions to move ahead with temporary abandonment of BP 's doomed Macondo well despite warning signs from a key test of well integrity . `` The various failures mentioned in this report indicate the lack of a suitable approach for anticipating and managing the inherent risks , uncertainties ... associated with deepwater drilling , '' the report said . Government regulators also failed to provide adequate oversight for deepwater drilling , according to the report . Ultimately , the report said there were not enough checks on decisions involving abandoning the well and there was no standard to weigh the trade offs between costs and safety for the project . `` Many of the pivotal choices made for the drilling operation and temporary abandonment of the well were likely to result in less cost and less time relative to other options , '' the report said . An April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers and ruptured the undersea Macondo well , unleashing millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over the summer . A BP worker was responsible for overseeing costs and schedules for the well , as well as issues relating to safety and well integrity , the report said . Despite testimony that `` safety was never compromised , '' the report said that drilling risks were not fully recognized . The panel said it will consider whether a separate system of oversight is necessary to ensure concerns about cost do not compromise safety . A BP spokesman said in a statement the company `` will reserve further comment until the committee 's interim report has been released publicly and we have had the opportunity to review it . '' The report is scheduled to be officially released on Wednesday . It follows findings released by the White House oil spill commission last week that said workers at the companies did not cut corners on safety to save money . The scientific panel 's report is critical of BP 's choice to use a long-string well design in a deep high-pressure well . It also questions the decision not to run a bond log to assess the stability of cement in the well . The companies involved with drilling the Macondo well have all traded blame over responsibility for the rig accident . Transocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig , and Halliburton , which did cementing on Macondo , have both charged that BP 's well design was a major factor in the explosion . BP has denied these claims , instead faulting Halliburton for a flawed cementing job on the well . BP and Transocean also disagree on who was in charge of interpreting the pivotal negative pressure test , which indicated severe problems with the well . But the report does not explicitly assign company fault for various mistakes that occurred in the run-up to the accident . Transocean and Halliburton did not immediately respond with comment on the report . Regarding the cementing , the report cited several possible reasons it may have failed , including the type of cement used and the decision to use only six centralizers . In addition , the multiple government agencies overseeing drilling operations were unclear about their specific duties creating gaps in oversight , the report said . Interior Department inspectors also were not sufficiently trained to enforce deepwater drilling regulations , it said . The Interior Department commissioned this report from organizations in the National Academy of Sciences , which advises the federal government on medical and scientific policy .

The proposal is part of a final set of rules being circulated by fund administrator Kenneth Feinberg , who is overseeing the release of cash to shrimpers , hotel owners , restaurateurs and others on the Gulf Coast seeking compensation . The proposed rule , outlined in a draft document obtained by Reuters , would still offer victims the opportunity for full payment for documented damages . Lawyers who have seen the document said it could be a powerful tool for BP as it seeks contributions to the compensation fund from other corporate defendants , including Halliburton Co and Transocean Ltd. `` I think the most significant thing about this is it reconceptualizes the fund as not just BP 's share but BP trying to settle all the claims with whoever accepts it and then being able to go after the others for a contribution , '' said Bob Percival , a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore . Language in the draft proposal requires that claimants transfer , or subrogate , their legal rights to BP . Claimants would sign over their right to sue those responsible for the spill in the same way a car owner might when accepting an insurance payment after being hit by a negligent driver . Just as the auto insurer could use that right to try to recover money from the negligent driver , BP will be able to pursue its partners for a portion of the claims it paid , according to legal experts who have seen the draft document . That could be worth billions of dollars if BP is successful . `` They are trying to shift the loss to other companies , '' said Michael Steenson , a law professor at William Mitchell College in St Paul , Minnesota . `` They are trying to get out of it at least some of what they put in . '' The proposal could be implemented as soon as next week , when the fund is scheduled to shift from paying partial emergency payments with no strings attached to final payments , which require claimants to drop lawsuits and legal claims . In an emailed statement on Wednesday , Feinberg 's office emphasized the language of the proposal is not final . The statement also said the fund will continue to make partial payments with no strings attached beyond next week . `` Options are available to claimants , '' the statement said . Feinberg circulated the proposed rules to lawmakers and attorneys for comment , but he has made clear the decision to implement the rules will be his , not BP 's . `` It is ultimately my call as the administrator , '' he told Reuters in an interview last week . Reuters obtained the draft document from two people involved in the claims process . BP declined to comment beyond saying it supports the efforts of the fund and those of Feinberg , who the company has called a neutral or independent administrator . Halliburton , which cemented BP 's well , and Transocean , which owned the rig , did not return calls seeking comment . Although legal specialists said there are few comparisons to the Gulf claims fund , similar transfers of rights were required for those who accepted payments from a fund set up to compensate for the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . Feinberg also oversaw that fund . The April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig set off the largest oil spill in U.S. history . Under pressure from the Obama administration , BP set up the claims fund in June . It was meant to demonstrate that the company would pay for the damage caused by the spill . More than 300,000 businesses and individuals have filed claims so far , and the fund has paid about $ 2 billion , Feinberg said . Last Friday , Halliburton moved to defend itself against BP . In court papers , the company said it did not intend to waive a $ 75 million legal cap on its liability from the spill and said that cap would apply toward efforts by others to get a contribution toward their settlements . BP has waived the cap and has encouraged its partners to do the same . The cap does not apply in cases of gross negligence or when federal safety regulations have been violated . The amount that each party could be at fault is unlikely to be resolved soon , and could be settled in a trial set for early 2012 . A White House oil spill commission last week issued a report largely agreeing with BP 's investigation that put much of the blame on the partners in the drilling operation . Feinberg will release his final rules at a time when he is under increasing criticism along the Gulf Coast for what some have called slow and inconsistent payment of claims . If fewer people sign up for final payments and instead pursue claims in court , that could add to BP 's legal problems . Plaintiffs could end up spending years in court and have no guarantee of winning , but if successful they could reap large punitive damage awards . Alabama Governor Bob Riley said last week that Feinberg was using `` extortion '' by underpaying emergency claims as a way to force businesses into the final settlement process . Feinberg told Reuters he has paid 85 percent of the claims for emergency payments in full . He also said he plans to continue a partial payment system , with no strings attached , so no one would be forced to a final settlement . `` I reject the criticism out of hand that the Gulf Coast Claims Facility is reducing payments for the vast number of claimants . It 's just not true , '' said Feinberg . The Press-Register newspaper in Mobile , Alabama has called for Feinberg to resign , saying he had tossed businesses in need `` just enough crumbs to barely keep them alive .

The commission is set to release its final report in January . -LRB- ID : nN08212171 -RRB- Following are some of the key conclusions of both reports : - Accident precipitated by decision to proceed to temporarily abandon well , despite indications from negative pressure tests that indicated problems with well integrity . - Decision to move ahead with completing project was compounded by delays in realizing natural gas was flowing in well and riser and failure to take timely well-control actions . - Decisions to move ahead despite warning signs indicate `` insufficient consideration of risk and a lack of operating discipline .

A 2009 spill of crude oil from a ruptured pipeline at the BP Exploration -LRB- Alaska -RRB- Inc.-operated Lisburne field showed that the company had failed to undertake the reforms it promised in its 2007 Prudhoe Bay criminal plea agreement , federal probation officer Mary Frances Barnes said in a petition filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Alaska . The move comes as BP faces scrutiny over its role in the massive Deepwater Horizon rig spill , with initial findings suggesting the company failed to identify critical mistakes . The Lisburne spill resulted when a pipeline exploded after being over-pressured . A long ice block caused internal pressure to build up , but BP ignored warning signs and its own policies about preventive measures , Barnes said in her petition . BP should have known to take those measures because it had a similar pipeline rupture caused by an ice plug in 2001 , Barnes said . In all , 45,828 gallons of crude oil and produced water -- a byproduct of the oil production process -- spilled from the two-foot long - -LRB- 0.6 meter - -RRB- rupture in the Lisburne line , according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation . The spill violated the federal Clean Water Act and state spill statutes , Barnes said . Such criminal violations breached terms of BP 's plea agreement , in which the company promised a series of reforms , paid a total of $ 20 million in fines , restitution and community service and was placed on one to three years ' probation . Barnes said Wednesday that she could not comment about the specifics of the BP case . In general , a petition to revoke probation can result in an evidentiary hearing and imposition of new punishment , she said . `` When probation has been violated , the judge can go back and resentence the defendant to any sentence that was available , '' she said . The Prudhoe Bay oil spill , in which 212,000 gallons of crude leaked onto the snow-covered tundra from a corrosion-eaten hole in a major transit line , was the biggest on record on the North Slope , Alaska 's main oil-producing region . That and a subsequent corrosion-cause spill five months later prompted a partial shutdown of the field , which is North America 's largest . It also resulted in the criminal penalty and civil complaints filed by the state and federal governments . BP wound up replacing its entire Prudhoe Bay transit line system , at a cost of $ 500 million . BP spokesman Steve Rinehart said the company will respond to Barnes ' allegations . `` We know that the privilege of working in Alaska comes with a responsibility to maintain high standards . We understand that earning and maintaining trust is key , '' he said in an email Wednesday . `` In line with those principles , BPXA has worked with the Department of Justice to try to resolve certain legal issues remaining from North Slope oil spills at Prudhoe Bay in 2006 , and Lisburne in 2009 . Unfortunately , that has not yet been successful , '' he said . BP has cleaned up the site of the Lisburne spill and , over the summer , transferred new tundra sod to restore it to its natural state , he said . -LRB- Editing by Bill Rigby and Sofina Mirza-Reid -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "40", "dct": "2010-11-19", "dates": [null, null], "text": "BP says it wo n't fight cap waiver on spill damages NEW YORK | Fri Nov 19 , 2010 6:26 pm EST NEW YORK Nov 19 -LRB- Reuters Legal -RRB- - BP Plc wo n't object to a court order legally binding the company to waive a $ 75 million statutory cap on damages for the largest oil spill in U.S. history , the company said on Friday . Earlier on Friday , the company was prepared to oppose a plaintiffs ' motion before U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier , who is overseeing the oil-spill litigation in New Orleans , seeking a ruling that the liability cap is inapplicable in this case . Noting that BP itself had told the court it would waive the cap , the plaintiffs ' lawyers asked Barbier to rule on the matter to preclude BP from `` re-urging this defense '' in the future . In a response filed on Wednesday , BP called the plaintiffs ' motion `` unnecessary '' and `` premature . '' But on Friday , the company said in a statement to Reuters Legal that if Barbier issues a court order making the cap waiver legally binding , `` BP will not object . '' On November 2 , BP raised its estimated cost of cleaning up the Macondo disaster by $ 7.7 billion to $ 40 billion . BP will likely try to recoup some of these costs from its Macondo partners , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC , as well as such contractors as Halliburton but the resolution could take years of court battles . BP has already paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to fishermen , retailers , charter boat captains and property owners who suffered from the spill . Under heavy pressure from the Obama administration , in June the company also established a $ 20 billion compensation fund for those damaged by the spill . Soon after BP 's Deepwater Horizon well began spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico in April , the company said that it would pay all legitimate claims , even though the Oil Pollution Act -LRB- OPA -RRB- could have limited BP 's liability for the disaster to $ 75 million , plus clean-up costs . But it was never clear whether BP 's pledge was legally binding , and signals from the company were mixed . During a court hearing last month , BP 's lawyers did not commit to waiving the OPA cap , which they called `` not relevant . '' After Barbier asked the company to clarify , it filed a statement with the court saying it was committed to waiving the cap . The BP statement said that the company 's opposition to the plaintiffs ' motion `` was not an indication that BP was wavering at all on its previous promises and commitments , '' but rather , was `` simply based on the legal deficiencies '' in the motion . Howard M. Erichson , a professor at Fordham University School of Law and an expert in mass torts , said plaintiffs ' lawyers were engaging in `` a bit of litigation gamesmanship . '' From the company 's perspective , he said , `` there is no upside having the waiver locked in , '' but opposing such a move could present a publicity problem . `` The extraordinary thing , '' he said , `` is the backdrop to this motion -- the fact that BP faced such an enormous public-relations crisis that it was willing to abandon some of its potential legal defenses early in the litigation . '' The case is In re Oil Spill , U.S. District Court , Eastern District of Louisiana , No. 10-MDL-2179 . The plaintiffs ' motion was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs ' steering committee by Stephen J. Herman of Herman Herman Katz & Cotlar and James Parkerson Roy of Domengeaux Wright Roy & Edwards .

'' said Kenneth Feinberg of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility on a conference call as the program stopped taking emergency claims and started work on final settlements . He warned that Gulf Coast people and businesses who decline to settle and refuse to give BP and its contractors a release from future risk of lawsuits might end up getting less money . `` There is no guarantee that , in the future , a lump sum final payment will be as generous as it will be currently , '' Feinberg said . The April 20 blowout of BP 's Macondo well while it was being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana killed 11 rig workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil , closing fisheries and stunting tourism from Louisiana to Florida . After the emergency claims filing period ended Tuesday , Feinberg outlined a final settlement process starting Wednesday that gives claimants two options . They can accept a lump sum final payment in exchange for releasing BP and its contractors from future liability . Or they can continue to receive interim payments in hopes of a bigger final payment in the future . Interim payments to claimants who filed by Tuesday could continue on a quarterly basis for as long as three years , the planned life of the fund , while they await final resolution . Claimants also have the option to appeal inside the program . A process allows claimants and BP limited opportunities to challenge the fund 's decisions . A three-judge panel will handle appeals , Feinberg said . Those who elect not to settle have the right to go outside the claims payment program and appeal to the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. federal courts , Feinberg said . Critics , who note that BP hired Feinberg , have questioned the speed and fairness of compensation and the fairness of demanding that claimants promise never to sue BP or its contractors before they can get a final settlement . `` Until we finish our negotiations with Mr. Feinberg , I advise claimants against signing a release or accepting a final payment without first consulting an attorney , '' Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood said in a statement . Feinberg said final settlements now will be more generous to cover possible future losses . He also said he is listening to critics , has made adjustments and expects to make more changes as the process evolves . `` I plan to deal with the problem , '' Feinberg said . `` There 's going to be inconsistencies . There 's going to be mistakes . And I plan to address those mistakes . '' Feinberg declined to estimate how many people will seek final settlements through the process . Some 7,000 already have filed final claims , he said . BP paid hundreds of millions of dollars to victims before the fund , set up after meetings with President Barack Obama , began operation in August . The spill was halted in July and the well permanently capped in September . Since it began , the fund has made $ 2 billion in emergency payments to 125,000 claimants , and the final emergency tally probably will reach $ 2.3 billion to 175,000 individuals and businesses , Feinberg said . More than 400,000 claims have been filed , including a recent surge of emergency claims that could take until mid-December to clear before his staff can turn to final settlements , Feinberg said . The fund is privately operated , but is intended to comply with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which requires responsible parties to compensate victims of spills . -LRB- Reporting by Bruce Nichols .

Better-than - expected underlying profits and upbeat comments from new Chief Executive Bob Dudley were taken by the market as a sign the company had turned the corner and would soon return to pumping out steadily rising dividends . Key to this sanguine outlook is confidence that the new estimate of the total cost of the spill -- $ 40 billion -- will be sufficient . `` We think that $ 40 billion adequately provisions for the liabilities that are outstanding so far , '' said Mark Lacey , Fund Manager at Investec Global Energy Fund . Paul Mumford , fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management , went further , saying the provision is likely to be overly conservative : `` You might well find that you get provision write-backs , '' he said , hinting the bill could be lower . That optimistic view may turn out to be true . BP executives have said this is their `` best estimate '' of costs , adding they could turn out lower . But history shows there is ample scope for nasty surprises from BP . The London-based oil giant -- last year it was the biggest non-state controlled oil and gas producer in the world -- has so far consistently underestimated the scope and potential cost of the Gulf spill . It also has a track record of low-balling disasters , including the fatal Texas City refinery blast in 2005 . Not only has the company underestimated the cost of repairing equipment and ecosystems in the past , it has also made overly optimistic assumptions about legal challenges . That may be happening again . CEO Dudley , an American who took over from Briton Tony Hayward in October , has said a $ 20 billion fund BP created to compensate victims of the spill should cover all damages claims . The lawyers who are suing BP do n't think so . `` The total value of the claims already registered could exceed the amount of money that has been dedicated to pay the fund , '' said Texas-based trial lawyer Brent Coon , who represents victims of the explosion and subsequent spill and who was prominent in litigation against BP after Texas City . `` Then you have the claims that have not been filed yet , and claims from those indirectly impacted , and shareholder derivative claims ... You have very large potential claims that could , in total , be exponentially greater than the amount set aside . '' Zygmunt Plater , Professor of Law at Boston College Law School , agrees . `` In the short term , it 's in everyone 's interests within the company to low-ball -- but the portents are there for a realistic inflation of $ 20 - $ 50 billon , '' he said . An analysis by Reuters of the potential fines , damages , costs related directly to the leak , compensation and the damage to BP 's business suggests the final spill bill could , over the long term , end up much higher than BP 's latest provision -- perhaps even more than twice as much . Much hinges on whether U.S. courts find the company was `` grossly negligent '' in the run-up to the disaster , but there are other risks . BP declined to comment for this article , beyond stating that it stands by its statements on the likely costs and that its estimates are based on the assumption that it was not grossly negligent . `` UNPRECEDENTED STRING OF BAD NEWS '' BP 's inability to gauge the true scope of the spill in the early days in April is well documented . After the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk , following an explosion which killed 11 workers , the company initially hoped to staunch the flow of oil from the well by activating shut-off valves with subsea robots . In case this did n't work , it started drilling a relief well to permanently plug the well from below . A week after the blast , the company said the well would take three months to complete and cost $ 100 million -- but that would be the most expensive part of the whole response operation . Combining this with the daily expenditure that BP reported at the time suggested a total bill of $ 200 million . BP hinted then that even this calculation was pessimistic . As estimates of the spill flow increased -- it eventually became the worst in U.S. history -- so did the cost . From an initial 1,000 barrels per day to 5,000 bpd , it finally reached 62,000 bpd . In June , BP told analysts the cost of containing and cleaning up the spill would be $ 3-6 billion . By mid-September , the response effort alone , excluding damages claims , had cost BP $ 8 billion . Investment analysts were forgiving of these errors . The disaster seemed to grow worse and worse making accurate estimates difficult . `` It was an unprecedented string of bad news , '' Simon Hawkins , oil analyst at Ambrian said last month . But even after the well was capped , BP appeared no more adept at forecasting costs . Twelve days after it had sealed the top of the well , on July 27 , the company said the likely cost of the spill would be $ 32 billion . On November 2 , it hiked its estimate by another 25 percent , or $ 8 billion . BP 's Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote blamed that increase mainly on a delay in completing the relief well , which meant the company needed to keep its offshore response effort going longer . In a conference call with analysts , he also cited costs related to decontamination of the thousands of ships used in the spill response and undefined administration and legal costs . BP did not give a detailed breakdown , but it is hard to see how the delay in the relief well accounted for most of the increased provision . Assuming an extra 40 days at the average cash-burn for the operation of $ 60 million per day gives an extra spend of only $ 2.6 billion . In addition to this , the well delay and many extra costs were already clear in July and could have been factored in earlier . Nonetheless , analysts have largely accepted the company 's estimates . Perhaps this is on the assumption that after months of bad publicity , the suspension of dividend payments for at least three quarters , a collapse in its share price to less than half its pre-spill level and a change of CEO , BP would take the opportunity to throw every conceivable cost into the mix and pave the way for recovery under a new boss . It 's a common enough practice when corporations change CEO . `` I tend to believe BP . Given how bad it was , they basically decided to kitchen-sink it , '' says Peter Hitchens , oil analyst at Panmure Gordon . WHAT HISTORY CAN TEACH US Such an assumption , though , may not be entirely safe in BP 's case . The company 's record of assessing costs after past disasters is less than stellar . BP 's Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico captured front pages around the world in the summer of 2005 when a hurricane left it listing precariously . The company predicted it would take a year and $ 250 million to repair the damaged platform . In the end , it took almost three years to fix ; analysts estimate BP spent more than $ 500 million . That undershoot was nothing compared with what followed the explosion at its Texas City refinery in 2005 . The blast killed 15 workers and ruined the company 's carefully nurtured reputation as the green and caring face of Big Oil . Because it was a single-point disaster , the cost of Texas City should have been easier to quantify than an ongoing catastrophe like the Gulf spill . A gasoline production unit destroyed in the blast would need to be replaced , BP said . The going cost for such machinery was widely agreed to be in the region of $ 100 - $ 200 million . A few pessimists added in ancillary damages , lost profits and legal costs to arrive at a total cost of $ 1 billion . But a month after the accident , then-CEO John Browne said the final bill would be `` significantly '' less than that and analysts put the total cost at around $ 300-400 million , a figure the company appeared comfortable with . By 2008 , though , BP had paid over $ 2 billion in compensation claims related to Texas City , while lost profits and repairs had cost another $ 1 billion at least . Claims remain outstanding , so the final tally could be even higher . Is BP making the same mistake on penalties and compensation again ? A `` gross negligence '' finding would require the Department of Justice to show a high degree of recklessness on the part of senior BP officials , rather than a mistake by a low-level worker . BP has blamed low-level employees and its contractors for the Deepwater Horizon rig blast . On November 8 , a report by the White House oil spill commission prompted many analysts to assume it was going to be tough to pin gross negligence on BP for the Gulf spill , and BP shares rose as a result . The commission said it had found no direct evidence of `` a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety '' in BP . But the commission 's co-chairmen , Bill Reilly and Bob Graham , subsequently stressed that its November 8 finding did not mean anyone was off the hook . They said a `` culture that did not promote safety '' had fostered misjudgments leading up to the disaster in all the companies involved . A panel of scientists conducting another probe for the government subsequently said that BP 's systems for managing drilling risks were inadequate . Some lawmakers argue that in BP 's case , the culture created an incentive for employees to short-cut safety precautions without issuing explicitly dangerous orders . David Logan , professor of law at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island , believes there is no legal reason why a claimant could not establish gross negligence on the part of a corporation based solely on its culture . `` Can you stitch together an argument of gross negligence from the corporate culture ? It is possible to do that , '' Logan says . If BP is found to be grossly negligent , the U.S. Clean Water Act allows for a fine of up to $ 4,300 per barrel , nearly four times the $ 1,100 maximum BP otherwise faces . The government estimates 4.9 million barrels of oil flowed from BP 's well , suggesting a maximum fine of $ 5.4 billion if `` gross negligence '' is not proven , and $ 21.1 billion if it is . The company has argued that it should receive credit for the 700,000 barrels of oil which it scooped from the surface or burned , and it disputes the government estimate of the size of the spill . `` I think there 's room for considerable discussion there , '' Dudley said last month . A close study of company statements suggests BP has factored in a fine below $ 4 billion . As well as adding billions to that , a gross negligence finding would prevent BP from forcing its partners to pay their share of any fine or cleanup costs . Anadarko Petroleum , 25 percent owner of the blown-out well , and 10 percent owner , Japan 's Mitsui , have so far refused to pay , saying their contractual obligation to do so is void due to gross negligence on the part of the project operator , BP . Any costs BP might recover are not included in its current estimates because accounting rules prevent this , although the company has said it does expect to recoup money from its partners and has reserved the right to sue the companies it hired to help drill the well . Most lawyers expect BP and the Department of Justice to reach a settlement that avoids a court ruling on the degree of negligence . The spill -- and President Barack Obama 's inability to halt it -- hurt the president 's ratings . `` The government can not let them get away with it . After President Obama came in with the heavy foot , they just ca n't , '' the chief executive of a rival oil company , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the spill , told Reuters . Plater , the Boston professor , says if the government sought to be aggressive it could attempt to broaden the interpretation of environmental and economic damages that BP must make good . Oil and fishing dominate employment along the Gulf coast , especially in Louisiana , the state worst hit by the spill . While most of the fishing bans have been lifted , experts say it will take years for the coast to recover . `` There are different ways of measuring natural resource damages and the ecosystem services argument , '' Plater says . When you knock out an ecosystem , looking at the damage in terms of indirect harm to the economy could carry the cost `` into the hundreds of billions '' . BP 's assessments of the environmental damage caused by the spill are at the optimistic end of the spectrum . A government report released in August suggested up to 75 percent of the oil had disappeared -- BP has often referred to this report , and former CEO Hayward recently told a gathering of students in Cambridge , England , that all of the spilled oil had gone . However , researchers at the University of Georgia said in late August that about three-quarters of the oil was still lurking below the surface ; other studies have also pointed to the prospect of severe long-term damage . BP will be on the hook to make any such damage good . Whatever BP ends up paying in fines and cleanup costs , there could be another big charge : punitive damages . Such a charge would be helped by a finding of gross negligence , though claimants could pursue punitive damages even if gross negligence was n't proven . Exxon Mobil paid punitive damages of $ 1 per $ 1 of economic damage following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska when the captain of the tanker , who had been drinking , hit a reef . Jamison Colburn , Professor of Law at Penn State University , says it is not entirely clear whether the current law covering oil spills at sea will allow punitive damages for BP , though if such damages are allowed , a one-to-one ratio would be in line with precedents like the Valdez . `` Punitive damages are a wild card , '' he said . `` It 's still an open question . '' In the Texas City case , BP settled all claims out of court , so a judge did not rule on punitive damages . However , lawyers say the amount paid out in settlements is consistent with an expectation there was a good chance significant punitive damages would have been awarded . If BP were to face punitive damages , given the prevailing estimates of economic damages at around $ 20 billion for the Gulf spill , a fine at the same ratio could add another $ 20 billion to its bill . But trial lawyer Coon says he believes punitive damages could be levied at a higher multiple , because the accusations against BP are greater than those Exxon faced . `` In that accident , a drunk captain inadvertently ran his ship onto a reef . The drunk captain was n't doing something at the request of the company , '' Coon said , referring to the arguments which would underpin a gross negligence claim . What 's clearly not included in BP 's spill estimate is a figure related to the damage the disaster has done to its U.S. business over the long term . BP said it lost 30,000 barrels per day of production in the Gulf -- one of its most profitable bases -- in the third quarter , and expected further impacts in the fourth quarter and into 2011 . But the added regulatory scrutiny the oil firm is likely to undergo in the United States will surely add to its operating costs . Analysts at Bernstein say BP 's upstream production costs could rise by 10 percent , or $ 280 million a year . Using the company 's own internal discount rate of 9-13 percent implies the present value of a 10 percent rise in these costs would be $ 2.5 billion . If other areas of BP 's U.S. business faced similar increases , the hit could be twice this . In addition , some lawmakers have called for BP , currently the Gulf 's largest operator , to be banned from future license rounds . `` BP may find that when its application for a license goes in , it is put in the ` pending ' file while Shell or someone else gets the license , '' said Iain Armstrong , analyst at Brewin Dolphin . Tally up fines commensurate with gross negligence , punitive damages at a ratio of just once economic damages , lower production , a 10 percent rise in U.S. operating costs , and difficulties in securing new reserves in the United States , and you quickly reach a figure around $ 50 billion . That may not be as dramatic as it sounds : some costs could still be shared with partners and contractors , many would be tax deductible , and they would in any case probably be payable over many years . The company can likely afford even the most pessimistic estimates . But things might not be as easy today as they were in 2005 . BP 's under-clubbing of the costs of Texas City was made up for by a more than doubling of the oil price between 2005 and 2008 . The outlook for crude now is less bullish , which may mean the oil giant has fewer places to hide . `` A very slight miscalculation now about what we think is going to happen is magnified by the huge numbers of stake holders -LRB- who could make claims -RRB- , '' said Logan of Roger Williams University . `` A billion here , a billion there and pretty soon you 're talking about real money . '' Despite BP 's official statements , some industry analysts say the company may be expecting to have to pay more . `` The way that they are selling assets and strengthening their balance , is what you would expect them to do if they were preparing for a worse scenario such as a finding of gross negligence , '' said one analyst who asked not to be named because he did not want to be seen questioning BP 's public comments . Currently , analysts predict BP will reinstate its dividend in early 2011 , at half the pre-spill level . If it has n't done its sums right , a return to steady dividend growth from the company could take quite a while longer . -LRB- Editing by Sara Ledwith and Simon Robinson -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

The government has said BP 's ruptured undersea well released between 53,400 and 60,000 barrels per day , but commission staff said BP orally told them those estimates were 20 percent to 50 percent too high . `` They rely on incomplete or inaccurate information , rest in large part on assumptions that have not been validated , and are subject to far greater uncertainties than have been acknowledged , '' BP said in written comments submitted to the commission in October . The disagreement over the amount of oil that flowed from BP 's ruptured undersea well sets up a legal battle over the billions in dollars in government fines the oil giant faces relating to the accident . A lower flow rate would call into question the government 's estimates that BP 's Macondo well spewed a total of 4.9 million barrels of oil this summer and would impact the amount of fines BP would have to pay for the drilling disaster . Under the Clean Water Act , the government could fine BP up to $ 4,300 for each barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf , which would mean a maximum fine of $ 21.1 billion for the oil giant , based on the government 's spill estimates . `` The relevance of how much oil was released obviously plays into the calculation of fines , '' said Commissioner Terry Garcia . `` It 's not surprising they think it was lower . '' In its comments , BP said the government 's estimates seemed to be biased toward the maximum amount of oil that could have been discharged instead of the amount most likely to have been released . BP said more information , such as an analysis of the rig 's blowout preventer , was needed before it can develop its own estimate of the well flow rates . But , ultimately , the company said , a full review will show `` possibly far less oil '' was spilled than the government estimated . The issue of flow rates is `` very complicated because it involves the flow path during different times in the spill ... it 's going to be litigated , '' Priya Aiyar , deputy chief counsel of the commission , said at a meeting on Friday . The comments came as the commission weighed proposals that would call for requirements for more accurate flow rate estimates from the start of a major oil spill . Some commissioners said they believed the government should be responsible for independently measuring flow rates , and not be reliant on the companies responsible for spills . Lack of accurate flow rate estimates at the start of the BP spill in April eroded public confidence in the government 's ability to handle the accident response , the panel said . Charged with guiding the future of offshore drilling , the commission is working to develop policy recommendations to prevent or better respond to spills . The seven-member panel 's official report is set to be released on January 11 , but it will be up to the Obama administration , lawmakers and the oil industry to decide whether to implement whatever framework the panel lays out .

The source said the action involved the filing of civil lawsuits , rather than criminal charges , stemming from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history and that it was expected to be announced at a news conference as early as Wednesday . The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout , which began in April and was finally sealed in September , fouled resort beaches and fishing grounds , and led to hundreds of lawsuits against BP Plc and its partners over lost revenues and wages . In June , Attorney General Eric Holder announced in New Orleans that the U.S. government had launched a criminal and civil investigation into the oil spill . The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday the Justice Department is expected to join the hundreds of civil lawsuits that have been filed as a result of the spill and will allege violations of environmental protection regulations , which could trigger penalties under such laws as the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act . `` We 're not confirming it , '' a Justice Department spokesman said of the newspaper report . But the source , who declined to give further details , confirmed the government 's civil filing in federal court was expected on Wednesday . The hundreds of civil lawsuits stemming from the spill have been consolidated in a New Orleans federal court and are being led by a committee of lawyers who represent injured workers and businesses . The Justice Department has said in court filings it has claims stemming from the spill including the destruction of natural resources as well as lost tax and royalty revenues . Penalties against BP under the Clean Water Act could top $ 20 billion if a court determines there was gross negligence . In September , the Justice Department wrote to the court to say it might join the litigation and it requested a special `` track '' just for government lawsuits .

The suit , the first by the U.S. government after the April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig in which 11 workers died , was filed in a New Orleans federal court which is considering private lawsuits against BP and the others for the spill . BP , which returned to profitability in the third quarter of 2010 , has begun selling assets and amassing a massive warchest to pay for damages caused by the oil spill , which the oil concern has estimated could reach as much as $ 40 billion . The oil company said on Wednesday it was weighing the sale of its Canadian natural-gas liquids business . In response to the lawsuit , BP said it is `` solely a statement of the government 's allegations and does not in any manner constitute any finding of liability or any judicial finding that the allegations have merit .

The lawsuit against BP and others warned that `` the full extent of potential injuries , destruction , loss and loss of services is not yet fully known and may not be fully known for many years . '' Shares in the companies targeted in the lawsuit fell in the wake of the lawsuit . The stocks trimmed early losses to close off their lows , with BP down 1.3 percent at $ 43.86 and Anadarko Petroleum down 2.3 percent at $ 67.41 . Halliburton , which was n't named in the suit , closed near session lows , down 3.1 percent at $ 39.79 . The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout spilled about 4.9 million barrels of oil over several months . It fouled resort beaches and fishing grounds and led to hundreds of lawsuits over lost revenues and wages . `` This is about getting a fair deal for the region that suffered enormous consequences from this disaster , '' said Lisa Jackson , head of the Environmental Protection Agency . The lawsuit accused the companies of violating safety and operating regulations in the period leading up to the disaster , including keeping the well under control , failing to use the best available and safest drilling technology and failing to maintain continuous surveillance of the well . The government claimed the companies violated the U.S. Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act , but the lawsuit does not request a specific dollar amount for damages . For every barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico , there could be a fine of up to $ 4,300 if gross negligence is found . That would equal a fine of at least $ 21 billion . If no gross negligence is found , the fine could be up to $ 1,100 per barrel or almost $ 5.4 billion . It will be up to the judge to weigh the evidence presented in court to determine if the defendants were grossly negligent in their conduct , a Justice Department official said . The Justice Department could also seek additional fines for harm to any animals protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act , among other environmental laws . The lawsuit did not name Halliburton , which did the cementing for the well , or Cameron International which provided well equipment , but Justice Department officials made it clear more defendants and charges could be added later . BP has taken responsibility for the cleanup but has questioned government estimates of how much oil came out of the well . BP co-owned the Macondo well with Anadarko and MOEX . After the lawsuit was filed , its partners said the blame and liability laid squarely on BP . Anadarko said it was not responsible for the decisions and operation for the well and therefore BP should be held responsible . Transocean , which drilled the well , also tried to pin the blame on BP . `` The responsibility for hydrocarbons discharged from a well lies solely with its owner and operator , '' Transocean said in a statement , adding it was `` indemnified in this matter . '' BP has estimated it may cost as much as $ 40 billion to pay for the spill , including the cleanup and penalties . The London-based oil firm has been selling numerous assets to raise as much as $ 30 billion to cover those costs . The Justice Department asked a federal judge in New Orleans overseeing the litigation to hold the companies liable , except for Lloyds , for unlimited damages , beyond the $ 75 million cap under the Oil Pollution Act . The judge in Louisiana , Carl Barbier , has been overseeing the hundreds of private lawsuits involving thousands of plaintiffs against BP and its partners . He has a status hearing set for Friday .

'' Shares in the companies targeted in the lawsuit fell in the wake of the lawsuit . The stocks trimmed early losses to close off their lows , with BP down 1.3 percent at $ 43.86 and Anadarko Petroleum down 2.3 percent at $ 67.41 . Halliburton , which was n't named in the suit , closed near session lows , down 3.1 percent at $ 39.79 . The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout spilled about 4.9 million barrels of oil over several months . It fouled resort beaches and fishing grounds and led to hundreds of lawsuits over lost revenues and wages . `` This is about getting a fair deal for the region that suffered enormous consequences from this disaster , '' said Lisa Jackson , head of the Environmental Protection Agency . The lawsuit accused the companies of violating safety and operating regulations in the period leading up to the disaster , including keeping the well under control , failing to use the best available and safest drilling technology and failing to maintain continuous surveillance of the well . The government claimed the companies violated the U.S. Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act , but the lawsuit does not request a specific dollar amount for damages . For every barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico , there could be a fine of up to $ 4,300 if gross negligence is found . That would equal a fine of at least $ 21 billion . If no gross negligence is found , the fine could be up to $ 1,100 per barrel or almost $ 5.4 billion . It will be up to the judge to weigh the evidence presented in court to determine if the defendants were grossly negligent in their conduct , a Justice Department official said . The Justice Department could also seek additional fines for harm to any animals protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act , among other environmental laws . The lawsuit did not name Halliburton , which did the cementing for the well , or Cameron International which provided well equipment , but Justice Department officials made it clear more defendants and charges could be added later . BP has taken responsibility for the cleanup but has questioned government estimates of how much oil came out of the well . BP co-owned the Macondo well with Anadarko and MOEX . After the lawsuit was filed , its partners said the blame and liability laid squarely on BP . Anadarko said it was not responsible for the decisions and operation for the well and therefore BP should be held responsible . Transocean , which drilled the well , also tried to pin the blame on BP . `` The responsibility for hydrocarbons discharged from a well lies solely with its owner and operator , '' Transocean said in a statement , adding it was `` indemnified in this matter . '' BP has estimated it may cost as much as $ 40 billion to pay for the spill , including the cleanup and penalties . The London-based oil firm has been selling numerous assets to raise as much as $ 30 billion to cover those costs . The Justice Department asked a federal judge in New Orleans overseeing the litigation to hold the companies liable , except for Lloyds , for unlimited damages , beyond the $ 75 million cap under the Oil Pollution Act . The judge in Louisiana , Carl Barbier , has been overseeing the hundreds of private lawsuits involving thousands of plaintiffs against BP and its partners . He has a status hearing set for Friday . A lawyer for private individuals suing BP over the spill said the new lawsuit by the Obama administration would not hurt their efforts . `` We look forward to continued cooperation with the U.S. government in pursuit of justice for all victims of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy , '' said the lawyer Steve Herman .

You need to read this . I new that rig just did n't blow up on its own . Please read this and study it and think about it and then figure out what should we Americans do now that the truth is becoming to the surface for us to digest ... ... . A grim report circulating in the Kremlin today written by Russia s Northern Fleet is reporting that the United States has ordered a complete media blackout over North Korea s torpedoing of the giant Deepwater Horizon oil platform owned by the World s largest offshore drilling contractor that was built and financed by South Korea s Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. . Ltd. , that has caused great loss of life , untold billions in economic damage to the South Korean economy , and an environmental catastrophe to the United States . Most important to understand about this latest attack by North Korea against its South Korean enemy is that under the existing laws of war it was a permissible action as they remain in a state of war against each other due to South Korea s refusal to sign the 1953 Armistice ending the Korean War . To the attack itself , these reports continue , the North Korean cargo vessel Dai Hong Dan believed to be staffed by 17th Sniper Corps suicide troops left Cuba s Empresa Terminales Mambisas de La Habana -LRB- Port of Havana -RRB- on April 18th whereupon it severely deviated from its intended course for Venezuela s Puerto Cabello bringing it to within 209 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform which was located 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- off the coast of the US State of Louisiana where it launched an SSC Sang-o Class Mini Submarine -LRB- Yugo class -RRB- estimated to have an operational range of 321 kilometers -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- On the night of April 20th the North Korean Mini Submarine manned by these suicidal 17th Sniper Corps soldiers attacked the Deepwater Horizon with what are believed to be 2 incendiary torpedoes causing a massive explosion and resulting in 11 workers on this giant oil rig being killed outright . Barely 48 hours later , on April 22nd , this North Korean Mini Submarine committed its final atrocity by exploding itself directly beneath the Deepwater Horizon causing this $ 1 Billion oil rig to sink beneath the seas and marking 2010 s celebration of Earth Day with one of the largest environmental catastrophes our World has ever seen . To the reason for North Korea attacking the Deepwater Horizon , these reports say , was to present US President Obama with an impossible dilemma prior to the opening of the United Nations Review Conference of the Parties to the Treat on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -LRB- NPT -RRB- set to begin May 3rd in New York . This impossible dilemma facing Obama is indeed real as the decision he is faced with is either to allow the continuation of this massive oil leak catastrophe to continue for months , or immediately stop it by the only known and proven means possible , the detonation of a thermonuclear device . Russian Navy atomic experts in these reports state that should Obama choose the nuclear option the most viable weapon at his disposal is the United States B83 -LRB- Mk-83 -RRB- strategic thermonuclear bomb having a variable yield -LRB- Low Kiloton Range to 1,200 Kilotons -RRB- which with its 12 foot length and 18 inch diameter , and weighing just over 2,400 pounds , is readily able to be deployed and detonated by a remote controlled mini-sub . Should Obama choose the nuclear option it appears that he would be supported by the International Court of Justice who on July 8 , 1996 issued an advisory opinion on the use of nuclear weapons stating that they could not conclude definitively on these weapons use in extreme circumstances or self defense . On the other hand , if Obama chooses the nuclear option it would leave the UN s nuclear conference in shambles with every Nation in the World having oil rigs off their coasts demanding an equal right to atomic weapons to protect their environment from catastrophes too , including Iran . To whatever decision Obama makes it remains a fact that with each passing hour this environmental catastrophe grows worse . And even though Obama has ordered military SWAT teams to protect other oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico from any further attack , and further ordered that all drilling in the Gulf of Mexico be immediately stopped , this massive oil spill has already reached the shores of America and with high waves and more bad weather forecast the likelihood of it being stopped from destroying thousands of miles of US coastland and wildlife appears unstoppable . And not just to the environmental catastrophe that is unfolding the only devastation to be wrecked upon the United States and South Korea by this North Korean attack as the economic liabilities associated with this disaster are estimated by these Russian reports to be between $ 500 Billion to $ 1.5 Trillion , and which only a declaration of this disaster being an act of war would free some the World s largest corporations from bankruptcy . Important to note too in all of these events was that this was the second attack by North Korea on its South Korean enemy , and US ally , in a month as we had reported on in our March 28th report titled Obama Orders Immediate Stand-down After Deadly North Korean Attack and which to date neither the Americans or South Korea have retaliated for and giving one senior North Korean party leader the courage to openly state that the North Korean military took gratifying revenge on South Korea . And for those believing that things couldn t get worse , they couldn t be more mistaken as new reports coming from Japanese military sources are stating that North Korea is preparing for new launches of its 1,300 kilometer -LRB- 807 miles -RRB- intermediate range ballistic Rodong missile which Russian Space Forces experts state is able to deploy and detonate an atomic electromagnetic pulse -LRB- EMP -RRB- device , and which if detonated high in the atmosphere could effectively destroy the American economy for years , if not decades , to come .

BP has not said what its strategy will be in fighting the myriad lawsuits against it , except to say its $ 40 billion estimate reflects its belief that it was not grossly negligent . The company also disputes the government 's 4.9 million barrel estimate of the amount of oil that spilt and said it hoped to receive some credit for recovering some spilt oil . All this suggests it could expect a fine of under $ 2 billion . But if the company is found to have been grossly negligent , it could face fines of $ 21 billion , and this would open the door to bigger awards against BP in civil lawsuits . Reuters reported earlier in December that BP 's costs could double if BP was found grossly negligent . This could put pressure on BP 's plans to reinstate its dividend early in 2011 , or force it to increase its planned $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion asset disposal program , said Manoj Ladwa , senior trader at ETX Capital . Analysts currently expect BP to announce a 7 to 10 cents dividend , down from 14 cents previously , for the fourth quarter . Some London-based analysts and investors downplayed the significance of the U.S. move . `` This action from the U.S. government has been completely expected , '' a top 10 investor said . `` We do n't perceive this as any kind of setback , as we do n't really think it changes things . '' However , David Uhlmann , a University of Michigan Law School professor and a former federal prosecutor said the lawsuit was a bad omen for BP . `` I would say the Justice Department was making a statement with the filing of yesterday 's complaint about the fact that they intend to be aggressive in holding BP and the other companies involved accountable for the Gulf oil spill , '' he said . `` It makes everything considerably more complicated for BP , '' added David Logan , Dean at the Roger Williams University School of Law . The mainly UK-based analyst community that covers BP has often struggled to estimate U.S. legal costs and penalties . After a fatal blast at BP 's Texas City refinery in 2005 that killed 15 workers , analysts predicted the disaster would cost BP $ 300 million to $ 400 million . By 2008 , though , BP had paid over $ 2 billion in compensation claims related to Texas City , while lost profits and repairs had cost another $ 1 billion at least . The government 's lawsuit also seeks damages from BP 's partners in the well , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Mitsui & Co Ltd unit MOEX , well driller Transocean Ltd and its insurer QBE Underwriting\\/Lloyd 's Syndicate 1036 . Shares in Swiss-based Transocean , the world 's largest offshore rig contractor , dropped 4.4 percent on Thursday . Anadarko 's shares -LRB- APC . N -RRB- were down 1.6 percent . Analysts said the inclusion of insurer QBE in the lawsuit alongside BP and other oil companies demonstrated that the U.S. government was casting its net as widely as possible as it seeks to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill . `` They 're just throwing these things at everybody . It 's the dartboard approach , '' said one London-based insurance analyst . Adding to the negative press on BP 's safety record , leaked U.S. diplomatic cables reveal BP suffered a blowout on an Azerbaijan gas platform in September 2008 and was fortunate to evacuate workers safely , Britain 's Guardian newspaper reported .

Oil majors ' offshore operations have come under tight global scrutiny after the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history . The spill wiped about $ 70 billion from BP 's market value and spurred BP to replace its Chief Executive Tony Hayward with an American , Bob Dudley .

Contogouris knew it was a big opportunity for CINC . He says he attempted to contact Costner , but could n't , because the actor was filming a movie in Canada . Instead , Contogouris spoke to one of Costner 's friends , who advised him that the actor 's stock in the company had already been sold . So Contogouris spoke with Shelton , and then tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with BP . Now , Baldwin enters the picture . In late April , Contogouris and Baldwin got together in New Orleans with a local attorney , John Houghtaling , and discussed making a documentary film based on the BP oil spill . Costner 's technology was then discussed . Houghtaling mentioned he could make an introduction to BP , and before long , a joint venture agreement was confected between Baldwin , Contogouris , Houghtaling , and others to market the CINC technology to BP . On May 13 , the joint venture , Ocean Therapies Solutions -LRB- OTS -RRB- , signed an agreement with CINC , whereby Contogouris got a 28 percent ownership and Baldwin got a 10 percent ownership in the new company . That same day , BP agreed to test the CINC technology for possible use in cleaning up the Deepwater Horizon spill . Members of the joint venture , OTS , began disagreeing about how to license the technology to BP -- whether it should be a long-term relationship or a one-time sale for a `` quick kill '' of the Gulf of Mexico disaster . Plus , there was said to be a falling out over the failed documentary about the oil spill , which soon resulted in a separate lawsuit . The disagreements threatened to blow up OTS , until Costner got involved again , testifying before Congress on June 9 about his technology . Soon after that , BP agreed to meet . But Contogouris and Baldwin claim in their new lawsuit that they were purposefully excluded from the meeting with BP , which resulted in an $ 18 million deposit for a larger purchase price of the technology . Contogouris and Baldwin say they were kept out of the loop about this money and were instead told that BP had placed no such order . Having believed that OTS had failed , Contogouris says he sold his interest in CINC 's new partner company . It 's alleged that the money that came from BP was used by Costner and one of his associates to buy Contogouris and Baldwin out of their interest in the venture . The deal was executed on June 11 in a `` Transfer , Withdrawal , Release and Indemnity Agreement '' whereby Contogouris gave up his 28 % share and Baldwin gave up his 10 % share in OTS for about $ 2 million total . A day later , BP purchased 32 units of the CINC technology for a gross price alleged to be in excess of $ 52 million . Two days after that , Costner and his associates\\/co-defendants `` clandestinely , secretly and wrongfully caused an unauthorized bank account to be opened '' without the knowledge of Contogouris and Baldwin . The account was allegedly used by Costner and an associate as `` their own personal piggy bank . '' The plaintiffs say they did n't discover what had happened , how they had been supposedly tricked out of their involvement in OTS , until mid-July . They are now suing for securities fraud and misrepresentation . Contogouris claims $ 10.64 million in damages . Baldwin claims $ 3.8 million in damages .

BP shares were up 5.6 percent to 491.7 pence by 1351 GMT -LRB- 8:51 EST -RRB- . The Daily Mail newspaper , citing sources close to the Anglo-Dutch group , reported Shell weighed an opportunistic bid for BP as crude gushed into the Gulf last summer , but was discouraged by the potentially uncapped legal liabilities . The newspaper said Shell could yet bid for BP if another suitor emerged but Europe 's largest oil company by market value was unlikely to be the `` first mover '' for number two , BP . Dealers and analysts including Mic Mills , head of electronic trading at ETX Capital , said BP was also being boosted by comments late on December 31 from the lawyer running BP 's gulf oil spill compensation fund that suggested damages payments could be half the expected level . Ken Feinberg , the independent administrator of the $ 20 billion fund set up by BP told Bloomberg Television about half the fund 's assets should be adequate to cover claims for economic losses . One dealer said the news reports focused minds on the fact BP shares were cheap compared to rivals . `` BP remains cheap and vulnerable at these levels but I do not think a bid is likely . '' BP shares trade on a price-earnings ratio of 6.5 times , consensus 2011 earnings , while Shell trades at 8.9 times , partly reflecting the fact BP 's actual earnings could be far lower if it was found to have been grossly negligent in causing the oil spill which would boost legal costs and fines . However , Feinberg 's comment highlighted how the picture could also be brighter than the company has predicted . The reports come ahead of a final report , to be released January 11 , by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill , which was convened by President Barack Obama to uncover what led to the U.S. 's worst ever oil spill . Comments by Commission members and documents previously released by the Commission suggest the report will be highly critical of BP , and could lead the way to multi-billion dollar federal fines . Analysts and industry sources said during the crisis last summer it was likely that both U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil and Shell -- the only companies considered large enough to mount a bid -- would run some calculations on a possible bid for BP . However , the two notoriously conservative companies were seen as likely to be discouraged by the open-ended nature of BP 's liabilities . Now BP 's shares have rebounded 65 percent from their June low at 296 pence , to give BP a market value of around $ 140 billion , a bid would be much harder to mount , especially for Shell which is worth over $ 210 billion . Exxon has a market value of almost $ 370 billion . It is uncertain whether regulators on either side of the Atlantic would support a tie-up in the top tier of the industry . Shell stock traded up 1.4 percent , against a 2.7 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index , which was lifted by crude prices which hovered near a 27-month high . BP and Shell declined comment .

In its final report on causes of the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history , the commission said BP and its collaborators on the doomed Macondo well had lacked a system to ensure their actions were safe . `` Whether purposeful or not , many of the decisions that BP , Halliburton , and Transocean made that increased the risk of the Macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time -LRB- and money -RRB- , '' the report said . Created by President Barack Obama in the midst of the BP spill , the panel is the first government-sanctioned group to wrap up its probe of the causes of the drilling disaster . Charged with guiding the future of offshore drilling , the commission will release its full review of the spill and its aftermath next week . Although the commission lacks authority to establish policy or punish companies , its conclusions could have a bearing on future criminal and civil cases relating to the spill . The findings contradict its initial report in November , which found no evidence that Macondo project workers cut corners to save money . After receiving criticism for that finding , the panel sought to clarify those comments , saying it did not mean companies involved with the accident had never sacrificed safety to save money .

LONDON | Thu Jan 6 , 2011 12:01 pm EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Shares in BP and Transocean rose on Thursday as investors bet a new Presidential panel report that spreads the blame for the country 's worst-ever oil spill means the companies will avoid a highly costly gross negligence charge . BP 's London-listed shares were up 1 percent at 504 pence at 1449 GMT , while Transocean 's U.S.-listed shares were up 1.8 percent at $ 74.57 . The STOXX 600 European oil and gas sector index was up 1 percent , on higher oil prices . The report blamed the rig blast and subsequent spill on bad decision-making by BP , drilling contractor Transocean and well cementer Halliburton , which it said highlighted bad industry practice and regulatory shortcomings . Haliburton shares traded down 1.4 percent at $ 38.86 after the report accused the company of using an unproven cement mix to seal the well , which subsequently blew out . The company denied the accusation . Investors and analysts said the fact that the blame for the blowout was shared so widely suggested BP and Transocean were less likely to be pinned with a allegation of gross negligence . Under U.S. law , BP faces fines of $ 5 billion because the spill happened on its exploration block . However , the fines could rise above $ 21 billion if Europe 's second-largest oil company by market value was found to have been grossly negligent in the run-up to the blast . Peter Hitchens , oil analyst at Panmure Gordon , said comments made in the report that the management failure which caused the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig reflected industry-wide flaws , also made BP appear less culpable . And while the report was damning , Richard Griffith , analyst at Evolution Securities said it could also mean BP can offload some of the costs of cleaning up the spill onto its contractors . `` The report may provide grounds for BP to claw back monies from license partners and possibly Transocean and Halliburton , '' he said in a research note . BP shares have gained over 60 percent since falling below 300 pence at the height of the crisis in June last year . Halliburton and Transocean 's shares have also recovered , although their performance has lagged that of rivals since November when the Presidential panel began making statements that shifted the focus of blame away from BP alone and toward its contractors . Shares in BP 's partner in the well , Anadarko Petroleum , were also hit since it stands liable for 25 percent of the spill costs but the explorer 's shares have recently been buoyed by takeover speculation . Meanwhile BP has selected a new director of communications , sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday , as it seeks to rebuild its image in the wake of the spill . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Just look at their track record . They are pointing fingers every way but theirs by trying to pass the buck onto the contractors !

Nearly 200,000 tons of methane -- more than any other single hydrocarbon emitted in the accident -- were released from the wellhead , and nearly all of it went into the deep water of the Gulf , researcher David Valentine of the University of California-Santa Barbara said in a telephone interview . Bacteria managed to take in the methane before it could rise from the sea bottom and be released into the atmosphere , but the process contributed to a loss of about 1 million tons of dissolved oxygen in areas southwest of the well . That sounds like a lot of oxygen loss , but it was widely spread out , so that the bacterial munching did not contribute to a life-sapping low-oxygen condition known as hypoxia , said Valentine , whose study was published in the journal Science . What happens to methane has been a key question for climate scientists , because methane is over 20 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide . Like carbon dioxide , methane comes from natural and human-made sources , including the petroleum industry . For two months after the BP blowout on April 20 , 2010 , methane was not being consumed in and around the wellhead , leading some scientists to suspect it might linger in the water and eventually make its way into the air , where it could potentially trap heat and contribute to climate change . `` If you have a very large release of methane like this , and it did make it into the atmosphere , that would be a problem , '' Valentine said . `` There have been a number of ... large-scale methane releases in the past that have come from the ocean that have warmed the climate . '' Those methane releases came from natural sources , and researchers like Valentine and his co-authors wondered what role bacteria might have had in those cases . The BP spill offered an `` accidental experiment '' that showed particular bacteria with an all-methane diet multiplied quickly as the methane spread with the underwater plume from the broken well . Peak consumption of methane probably came in late July and early August , Valentine said . Other organisms dealt with other hydrocarbons , including ethane and propane emitted in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . The methane-eating bacteria were the last to the hydrocarbon banquet , and based on past observation , the scientists questioned whether they could do the job . `` Given observations about how slowly methane is normally consumed , we did n't think the -LRB- bacteria -RRB- population was up to the challenge at all ... we thought it would be a lot slower , '' Valentine said . The fact the bacteria took in that large amount of methane could indicate that bacteria might absorb other large-scale deep ocean methane releases , the scientists said . The U.S. government filed a civil suit last month against BP and its partners for damage caused by the spill . The White House commission on the oil spill said on Wednesday that BP and its partners made a series of cost-cutting decisions that ultimately contributed to the spill .

The tough part is when that information rockets around Washington , as occurred after a White House commission issued its final report on the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . The `` Deep Water '' report , apparently titled in reference to the doomed BP Deepwater Horizon rig , blames the deadly blowout and oil spill on government and industry complacency , and recommends more regulation of offshore drilling and a new independent safety agency . But as my colleague Ayesha Rascoe reports , the commission lacks the authority to establish drilling policies or punish companies . Within minutes of the report 's release , and even as commission co-chair William Reilly was bragging about bringing the report in on time and under budget , interest groups started the PR barrage , with industry critical and environmental outfits largely complimentary . Two Democratic members of Congress said they 'd introduce legislation to implement the commission 's recommendations . Will that legislation go anywhere ? Industry analysts are doubtful . To get an idea of how much action can be prompted by White House panels , it 's useful to take a look at two previous ones . The 911 Commission -LRB- formally called `` The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States '' -RRB- was perhaps the ultimate in gracefully delivering its hard findings : `` ... on that September day we were unprepared . We did not grasp the magnitude of a threat that had been gathering over time . As we detail in our report , this was a failure of policy , management , capability , and above all a failure of imagination . '' Aug 9 , 2010 16:00 UTC Oil caused the mess in the Gulf of Mexico . Should U.S. oil royalties pay for scientists to study what happened , and what 's still happening , to this complex environment ? At least one scientist thinks so . Ed Overton of Louisiana State University figures the billions of dollars collected in royalties by the now-defunct and much-reviled Minerals Management Service -- re-named and re-organized as the Bureau of Ocean Energy -- must have enough money to pay for research into the environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon blowout and spill . Speaking at a Senate hearing last week on the effects of oil-dispersing chemicals , Overton and other experts called the BP spill an unintentional `` grand experiment '' into what deep water oil exploration can do to animals , plants , water and land in the Gulf . As Overton put it , the oil and dispersants are out there now . Best to study them over the months and years ahead to figure out what they 're doing to the environment . Jul 23 , 2010 21:29 UTC The Obama administration admitted today that the economy was facing strong headwinds and that government finances were on an unsustainable path . Not a great backdrop as we head into November s elections , as the White House is only too well aware . But at least the president is trying to set a good example himself . Yesterday we heard how the Obama family was putting its vacations to work for the good of the economy , visiting the Florida Gulf Coast where tourism has been savaged by the oil spill . Now we learn that the First Daughters are getting lessons in managing their money wisely . Not only do Malia and Sasha have their own savings accounts , but they are nearly ready to start earning money babysitting . While those are valuable lessons for a 12 and nine-year-old girl , I am not sure how the $ 10 an hour they might earn would cover the costs of their driver and armed guard . Otherwise , today s highlights include an analysis of the resurgent fortunes of Sarah Palin and her increasingly influential role in the run up to the November mid-terms . And take a look too at our examination of what might be in store when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid unveils a stripped down energy bill next week . You 've probably seen the disturbing images of pelicans so badly mired in leaking oil in the Gulf of Mexico that they can barely be distinguished as birds at all -- they look like part of the muck . But nearly three months after the blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , there are other pelicans touched by the oil where the impact is far less apparent , though still real . Take a look at some video I took during a boat trip on July 15 along West Pass , a long channel stretching out into the ocean from Louisiana 's southern-most tip : Jul 18 , 2010 15:26 UTC After a laid-back family getaway on Maine 's scenic shoreline , it 's back to political reality for President Barack Obama . The first family wrapped up a three-day mini-vacation in the upscale Bar Harbor resort and boarded a small presidential jet headed for Washington , where Obama will again face the daily pressures and policy battles . In the coming week , he will weigh the latest dose of good news together with lingering concerns about the BP oil spill , sign a Wall Street overhaul into law and hold talks with new British Prime Minister David Cameron . Enduring problems like the struggling economy , high unemployment and the war in Afghanistan also remain on his plate . From Ernest Scheyder in LAROSE , La. : A program like this can not be designed and administered from Washington , '' he said . `` You have to come down here and take time to listen . '' The claims process will transition from BP 's control to become the new `` Gulf Coast-Feinberg '' program within 20 days , and soon applicants will be able to file claims online after complaints by many affected by the leak that the process is often cumbersome , requiring stacks of paperwork and several visits to claims centers . Jun 22 , 2010 13:39 UTC Shakespeare definitely put it best , in that famous balcony scene from `` Romeo and Juliet '' : `` What 's in a name ? That which we call a rose , by any other name would smell as sweet . '' But what if the original smell was n't so great ? Will a name change make a difference ? That might have been the purpose behind the Obama administration 's decision to change the name of the U.S. agency that oversees offshore oil drilling -- the Minerals Management Service -- to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , or Bureau of Ocean Energy for short . The name change is part of a redo at the agency , which is being broken up into three divisions so that the same agency that grants permits to drill does n't also oversee safety . There will also be a new chief , former Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich , to lead the reorganization . The renovation at the agency comes after criticism over the old MMS 's handling of BP 's Deepwater Horizon well and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Just hours after Barton 's remarks on Thursday , the House and Senate Democratic campaign committees issued fund-raising appeals featuring and ridiculing the white-haired Texan . `` You wo n't believe this , '' begins the letter from the House Democratic campaign committee . `` Yes , Texas Congressman Joe Barton actually apologized to BP CEO Tony Hayward . '' To underscore how seriously he is taking the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , President Barack Obama has chosen to make his nationwide address on the environmental disaster his first speech from the Oval Office , a setting presidents typically reserve for the gravest occasions -- President George W. Bush spoke from there after the September 11 attacks , President Bill Clinton announced air strikes on Iraq , and President Ronald Reagan chose the Oval to talk about the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger . Administration officials said Obama will lay out how to deal with the oil that has leaked so far and what must be done to clean up and restore the Gulf , talk about what is being done for those who have lost jobs and business because of the disaster and discuss changing U.S. energy policy to reduce dependence on oil and fossil fuel . As he grapples with the spill , Obama has been pushing Congress to pass a new law that would fight climate change and ramp up production of renewable fuels , but the measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate , where Republican leaders are sternly denouncing any effort to link provisions of the energy bill with the Gulf disaster . Jun 9 , 2010 20:27 UTC Republicans may be coming around to former Vice President Al Gore 's way of thinking . Not on climate change , but on the `` lockbox . '' During his failed 2000 presidential bid , Gore talked about setting aside Social Security tax surpluses and putting them in a kind of '' lockbox '' to keep them off limits for other government spending and tax cuts . NBC 's `` Saturday Night Live '' comedy show made great fun of the Democrat 's comment . Now Senate Republicans have revived the idea . Not for Social Security , but for the oil spill clean up fund . Democrats are proposing to increase the oil spill clean up fund tax to 41 cents a barrel from 8 cents a barrel . The increase is part of a bill being considered by the Senate to help the long-term unemployed , offer relief to cash-strapped states and extend some expired business tax breaks .

WASHINGTON | Tue Jan 11 , 2011 5:42 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A White House panel probing BP 's massive oil spill called for an overhaul of a regulatory system that was `` entirely unprepared '' for disaster and outlined stringent , new oversight , a plan sure to face opposition from Republicans reluctant to expand government involvement . The White House oil spill commission said in its final major report that the U.S. government needs to expand its drilling regulations , as well as set up an independent drilling safety agency . `` None of the major aspects of offshore drilling safety -- not the regulatory oversight , not the industry safety standards , not the spill response practices -- kept pace with the push into deepwater , '' said commission co-chair Bill Reilly . `` In effect , our nation was entirely unprepared for an inevitable disaster , '' he said . Many of the recommendations would require Congressional approval , however , and Republicans have been critical of extensive new regulations , saying they would further slow the exploratory pace following last year 's drilling moratorium that was imposed in response to the spill . Republican lawmaker Fred Upton , who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee , blasted the commission 's findings , saying they failed to clearly identify the root cause of the `` unprecedented disaster . '' `` Neither this nor any investigation should be used as political justification for a pre-determined agenda to limit affordable energy options for America , '' Upton said in a statement . Oil companies have voiced concerns that onerous new regulations could hamper offshore exploration and drive up oil prices . U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production fell by 70,000 barrels per day in fourth quarter of 2010 , with further drops expected this year and in 2012 . But Reilly said it was time for Congress `` to exercise serious oversight '' in a regime that has not kept pace with the industry 's push into deeper and deeper waters . As a first step , he demanded that Congress provide the funding to hire additional government inspectors for drilling operations . Following the BP accident , the Interior Department restructured the agency responsible for overseeing drilling and has instituted a raft of new safety rules . `` We have already implemented several of the key reforms the commission has made clear are necessary , and we will use the commission 's report and the findings of other investigations to inform future actions to strengthen safety and oversight , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement . The seven-member commission also pushed for the oil industry to create a self-regulating entity to help enforce standards and called on Congress to raise liability limits on offshore drilling operators . Modeled on the nuclear industry 's Institute of Nuclear Power Operations , a self-regulatory group would allow offshore drillers to hold their counterparts more accountable , the commission said in its final report . While not calling for a halt to drilling in the Arctic , the commission said there is need for more study of the intense physical conditions and Interior should ensure that companies have adequate plans and resources to handle a spill there . The commission was created by President Barack Obama after an April 20 explosion ruptured BP 's underwater Macondo well , killing 11 workers in the Gulf of Mexico and leading to the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . The commission is the first government-sanctioned group to wrap up its probe of the causes of the BP accident . Its report contains few surprises , as it mirrors many statements and reports released by the panel over the past six months . Although the commission lacks the authority to establish drilling policies or punish companies , its findings could influence future court proceedings and energy policy . Paul Sankey , an analyst with Deutsche Bank Oil , said he thinks U.S. offshore activity will be lower in the aftermath of the spill . `` The broadness of these recommendations and lack of specifics will delay activity , '' Sankey said . Still , despite these concerns from the industry , Chevron Corp greenlit plans to invest nearly $ 12 billion in two major deepwater Gulf projects late last year . The American Petroleum Institute criticized the panel 's report for casting doubt on the entire oil industry based on a single accident . `` This does a great disservice to the thousands of men and women who work in the industry and have the highest personal and professional commitment to safety , '' said API Upstream Director Erik Milito . The PHLX oil service index jumped 2.3 percent on Tuesday , outperforming the tepid gains of 0.5 percent in the broader S&P 500 index . The sector , which has largely been on a climb since early September , is nearing the highest point since September 2008 . Cameron International Corp , which made the blowout preventer on the BP well , drove the equipment sector index higher with gains of more than 4 percent in afternoon trading . BP added nearly 3 percent , while Halliburton gained 3.2 percent and Transocean rose 2.3 percent . -LRB- Additional Reporting by Timothy Gardner ; Editing by Russell Blinch and Lisa Shumaker -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Jan. 5 - BP and its partners made a series of cost-cutting decisions that ultimately contributed to an oil spill , the White House oil spill commission says in its final report on the causes of the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . -- The commission says BP and its collaborators lacked a system to ensure their actions were safe . Jan. 11 - The White House oil spill commission , in its final report of the BP drilling disaster , says the U.S. government needs to expand its drilling regulations , as well as set up an independent drilling safety agency , because the regulatory system was unprepared for the disaster . -- Most of the recommendations require approval from the U.S. Congress , which will be difficult as Republican lawmakers fear extensive new regulations would slow oil drilling . Oil companies expressed similar concerns , saying hampering offshore production with burdensome rules would drive up oil prices .

The tough part is when that information rockets around Washington , as occurred after a White House commission issued its final report on the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . The `` Deep Water '' report , apparently titled in reference to the doomed BP Deepwater Horizon rig , blames the deadly blowout and oil spill on government and industry complacency , and recommends more regulation of offshore drilling and a new independent safety agency . But as my colleague Ayesha Rascoe reports , the commission lacks the authority to establish drilling policies or punish companies . Within minutes of the report 's release , and even as commission co-chair William Reilly was bragging about bringing the report in on time and under budget , interest groups started the PR barrage , with industry critical and environmental outfits largely complimentary . Two Democratic members of Congress said they 'd introduce legislation to implement the commission 's recommendations . Will that legislation go anywhere ? Industry analysts are doubtful . To get an idea of how much action can be prompted by White House panels , it 's useful to take a look at two previous ones . The 911 Commission -LRB- formally called `` The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States '' -RRB- was perhaps the ultimate in gracefully delivering its hard findings : `` ... on that September day we were unprepared . We did not grasp the magnitude of a threat that had been gathering over time . As we detail in our report , this was a failure of policy , management , capability , and above all a failure of imagination . '' Aug 9 , 2010 16:00 UTC Oil caused the mess in the Gulf of Mexico . Should U.S. oil royalties pay for scientists to study what happened , and what 's still happening , to this complex environment ? At least one scientist thinks so . Ed Overton of Louisiana State University figures the billions of dollars collected in royalties by the now-defunct and much-reviled Minerals Management Service -- re-named and re-organized as the Bureau of Ocean Energy -- must have enough money to pay for research into the environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon blowout and spill . Speaking at a Senate hearing last week on the effects of oil-dispersing chemicals , Overton and other experts called the BP spill an unintentional `` grand experiment '' into what deep water oil exploration can do to animals , plants , water and land in the Gulf . As Overton put it , the oil and dispersants are out there now . Best to study them over the months and years ahead to figure out what they 're doing to the environment . President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron , both repeatedly calling each other by their first names , were at pains today to demonstrate the warmth of ties between their two nations , despite an embarrassing row about BP , the oil spill and Lockerbie . Joking about the temperature beer should be served and the tidiness of their children s bedrooms , the two men , both left-handers we now realize , clearly wanted to show they enjoyed a personal rapport . A deliberate contrast to the businesslike tone of the relationship with Gordon Brown ? You 've probably seen the disturbing images of pelicans so badly mired in leaking oil in the Gulf of Mexico that they can barely be distinguished as birds at all -- they look like part of the muck . But nearly three months after the blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , there are other pelicans touched by the oil where the impact is far less apparent , though still real . Take a look at some video I took during a boat trip on July 15 along West Pass , a long channel stretching out into the ocean from Louisiana 's southern-most tip : Jul 18 , 2010 15:26 UTC After a laid-back family getaway on Maine 's scenic shoreline , it 's back to political reality for President Barack Obama . The first family wrapped up a three-day mini-vacation in the upscale Bar Harbor resort and boarded a small presidential jet headed for Washington , where Obama will again face the daily pressures and policy battles . In the coming week , he will weigh the latest dose of good news together with lingering concerns about the BP oil spill , sign a Wall Street overhaul into law and hold talks with new British Prime Minister David Cameron . Enduring problems like the struggling economy , high unemployment and the war in Afghanistan also remain on his plate . From Ernest Scheyder in LAROSE , La. : A program like this can not be designed and administered from Washington , '' he said . `` You have to come down here and take time to listen . '' The claims process will transition from BP 's control to become the new `` Gulf Coast-Feinberg '' program within 20 days , and soon applicants will be able to file claims online after complaints by many affected by the leak that the process is often cumbersome , requiring stacks of paperwork and several visits to claims centers . Jun 22 , 2010 13:39 UTC Shakespeare definitely put it best , in that famous balcony scene from `` Romeo and Juliet '' : `` What 's in a name ? That which we call a rose , by any other name would smell as sweet . '' But what if the original smell was n't so great ? Will a name change make a difference ? That might have been the purpose behind the Obama administration 's decision to change the name of the U.S. agency that oversees offshore oil drilling -- the Minerals Management Service -- to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , or Bureau of Ocean Energy for short . The name change is part of a redo at the agency , which is being broken up into three divisions so that the same agency that grants permits to drill does n't also oversee safety . There will also be a new chief , former Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich , to lead the reorganization . The renovation at the agency comes after criticism over the old MMS 's handling of BP 's Deepwater Horizon well and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Just hours after Barton 's remarks on Thursday , the House and Senate Democratic campaign committees issued fund-raising appeals featuring and ridiculing the white-haired Texan . `` You wo n't believe this , '' begins the letter from the House Democratic campaign committee . `` Yes , Texas Congressman Joe Barton actually apologized to BP CEO Tony Hayward . '' To underscore how seriously he is taking the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , President Barack Obama has chosen to make his nationwide address on the environmental disaster his first speech from the Oval Office , a setting presidents typically reserve for the gravest occasions -- President George W. Bush spoke from there after the September 11 attacks , President Bill Clinton announced air strikes on Iraq , and President Ronald Reagan chose the Oval to talk about the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger . Administration officials said Obama will lay out how to deal with the oil that has leaked so far and what must be done to clean up and restore the Gulf , talk about what is being done for those who have lost jobs and business because of the disaster and discuss changing U.S. energy policy to reduce dependence on oil and fossil fuel . As he grapples with the spill , Obama has been pushing Congress to pass a new law that would fight climate change and ramp up production of renewable fuels , but the measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate , where Republican leaders are sternly denouncing any effort to link provisions of the energy bill with the Gulf disaster . Jun 9 , 2010 20:27 UTC Republicans may be coming around to former Vice President Al Gore 's way of thinking . Not on climate change , but on the `` lockbox . '' During his failed 2000 presidential bid , Gore talked about setting aside Social Security tax surpluses and putting them in a kind of '' lockbox '' to keep them off limits for other government spending and tax cuts . NBC 's `` Saturday Night Live '' comedy show made great fun of the Democrat 's comment . Now Senate Republicans have revived the idea . Not for Social Security , but for the oil spill clean up fund . Democrats are proposing to increase the oil spill clean up fund tax to 41 cents a barrel from 8 cents a barrel . The increase is part of a bill being considered by the Senate to help the long-term unemployed , offer relief to cash-strapped states and extend some expired business tax breaks .

The opinions expressed are her own . Next week world leaders will gather in Davos for the annual World Economic Forum to discuss topics ranging from climate change to global risks and economic growth . Looming in the background will be last year s massive Gulf oil spill , which has serious implications for all of those issues . In the postmortem analyses of the spill , my former employer , BP , looks like the opposite of a model corporate citizen , having apparently contributed to 11 deaths , numerous other injuries , and the release of over four million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . I struggle to reconcile the BP on view today , in which reckless cost-cutting and risk-taking seem to run rampant , with the BP I worked for , which went above and beyond what was required to take care of its employees and neighbors . The latter in no way exonerates the former , but examining the two different faces of the company shows how we can improve corporate behavior -- not just of BP , but of business more broadly . When I moved to Indonesia for BP in 2000 , my assignment was to make sure that a planned liquefied natural gas plant would benefit the people of West Papua , the country s easternmost province on the island of New Guinea . History showed that communities from Azerbaijan to Zambia have had their hopes raised by the discovery of oil , gas , or minerals in their area , but ultimately reaped little more than corruption and pollution . And West Papua isn t just any community -- it s home to flora and fauna that don t exist anywhere else , and indigenous tribes that have had little contact with the West . BP management gave me an ample budget and license to explore , intrigued by the possibility of creating a new model of development that would exorcise the so-called resource curse . At a minimum , they didn t want the project to be yet another example of how things can go horribly wrong when local relationships turn sour . I traipsed around villages near the plant site , organizing consultations , studies and programs on everything from education to entrepreneurship . When we learned that one of the plant s jetties would cross over a site where local residents worshiped their ancestors , our engineers demonstrated their usual problem-solving gusto and rerouted the jetty . This maneuver cost the company money , but much less than the potential cost of conflict . While my work there wasn t easy and we didn t get everything right , an expert panel noted in 2009 that there was strong local support for the project and appreciation among Papuans for the consultations that BP conducted and for the infrastructure and economic benefits the project brought to the area . That experience led me to believe that corporate and societal interests could be aligned , given the right leadership , staff and resources . My belief was sustained through my next assignment in China , where I worked to ensure that the worker dormitories for a chemicals plant met international safety standards . Through a stint at BP s headquarters in London , I worked with colleagues in Angola , Colombia , Russia and elsewhere to develop a new human rights policy for the company . In the U.S. , however , a very different BP emerged . In 2005 , an explosion at a refinery in Texas killed 15 people . In 2006 , the Prudhoe Bay pipeline leaked 200,000 gallons of oil into the Alaskan tundra . On April 20 of last year , the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded . How could a company that tried so hard to get it right in faraway lands get it so wrong in its own backyard ? Maybe BP got complacent in the U.S. , given the lack of scrutiny from regulators or anyone else ? While the projects I worked on were in new markets that were lucrative but gnarly , eliciting concern from investors , campaigners , and the company itself , perhaps they were much more marginalized than I realized . We need to demand that companies calculate risks not just for their bottom line , but for society at large -- recognizing that in the long run the two are often the same . We need scrutiny of those calculations from all parts of society -- not just by lawmakers and regulators -LRB- although that would be a good place to start -RRB- , but by pension funds , neighbors and the media . We need to understand what motivates companies , for better and for worse . As those at Davos discuss how to create a more sustainable future , we should study not just what BP did wrong , but also what it tried to get right .

But it is a chancy proposition for global mega-corporations , competing in their own gigantic arenas , to place societies ' interests ahead of their own essential profit motives , without intelligent , agile public regulation that seeks to maximize both goals .

The renewed push to boost government oversight of offshore drilling came as the co-chairs of the White House oil spill commission , Bill Reilly and Bob Graham , made their case for legislation on the issue at two separate congressional hearings . Charged with guiding the future of offshore drilling , the spill commission called for a complete overhaul of drilling regulations in its final report released this month . At the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee 's hearing with the commission co-chairs , committee head Senator Jeff Bingaman said he planned to tackle oil spill legislation during this Congress . `` We must ensure that we have systems in place in our government and in the industry so that this can not happen again , '' Bingaman said at the hearing . The Senate energy committee passed legislation that would have strengthened drilling oversight last year after BP 's underwater Macondo well spewed millions of barrels of oil into Gulf of Mexico over the summer . But that legislation never became law . With more information now available from the spill commission and other sources , Bingaman said , the committee would be able to improve the previous bill . Several House Democrats , including Representatives Henry Waxman and Edward Markey , also introduced their own `` revamped '' spill legislation on Wednesday , based on measures that passed the House last year and on the commission 's report . The House Democrats ' bill would establish unlimited legal liability for oil spills , which the lawmakers said would deter companies from taking too many risks . Still , any new oil spill legislation would likely be difficult to get through Congress as Republicans have raised concerns that onerous new drilling regulations could hurt domestic oil and natural gas production . Republican Doc Hastings , chairman of the House Natural Resources committee , said there is a need to focus on making drilling safe , but not at the expense of U.S. oil and gas output . `` The oil spill was a terrible tragedy , but it should not be used as an excuse to further reduce America 's access to our energy resources , '' Hastings said during a House committee hearing with the spill commission co-chairs . Several Republican lawmakers at the hearing blasted the White House spill commission because they said the report did not specifically identify the cause of the spill and they also accused the panel of being ideologically opposed to offshore drilling . In one especially contentious exchange , Representative Tom McClintock of California , said the commission participated in a `` rush to judgment . '' `` You are recommending a whole new level of bureaucracy on top of an obviously already failed bureaucracy with the obvious aim of indefinitely delaying of the production of our nation 's energy reserves , '' McClintock said . Commission co-chair Reilly disputed these claims . `` The degree to which we add anything it is intended to provide more capability , more expertise ... facilitating more confident permitting and better regulatory oversight of the industry . I do n't think it would work to delay , '' Reilly said . We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .
